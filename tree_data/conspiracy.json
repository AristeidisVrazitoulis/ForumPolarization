The people who you are quoting arent the ones in charge of the show. \"In order to stabilize world population, we must eliminate 350,000 per day.\"\n\"Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government\" Henry Kissinger\n\"Depopulation should be the highest priority of foreign policy towards the third world, because the US economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad, especially from less developed countries\" Kissinger again\n\"The world today has 6.8 billion people\u2026that\u2019s headed up to about 9 billion. If we do a really great job on vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 to 15 percent.\"\nBill Gates\n\"One-fourth of humanity must be eliminated from the social body. We are in charge of God\u2019s selection process for planet Earth. He selects, we destroy. We are the riders of the pale horse, Death.\" Barbara Hubbard\n\"The Planetary Regime might be given responsibility for determining the optimum population for the world and for each region and for arbitrating various countries\u2019 shares within their regional limits. Control of population size might remain the responsibility of each government, but the Regime would have some power to enforce the agreed limits.\"\nJohn Holdren\n\"Society has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce their kind\" Theodore Roosevelt\n\"If a Black Death could be spread throughout the world once in every generation survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full.\"\nBertrand Russell\n\"U.S. policy toward the third world should be one of depopulation\"\nHenry Kissinger.....again lmao\n\"Another method (of depopulation) is disease infection through bio-weapons such as Ebola and AIDS, which are race targeting weapons. There is a weapon that can be put in a room where there are Black and White people, and it will kill only the Black and spare the White, because it is a genotype weapon that is designed for your genes, for your race, for your kind.\" Louis Farrakhan\n\"A total population of 250-300 million people, a 95% decline from present levels, would be ideal.\" ~ Ted Turner founder of CNN TBS etc\n\"In the event that I am reincarnated, I would like to return as a deadly virus, in order to contribute something to solve overpopulation.\" ~ Prince Philip\n\"Frankly I had thought that at the time Roe was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don't want to have too many of.\" ~ Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nSo you can see why I think they want depopulation lmao. Some of these people are the most powerful today. Sure a few people or researches can get on a Ted talk and talk about how we need more people. Great. But that still doesn't change the elites mindset at the top who have the most power",

Which is affected directly by the labor pool.... \n\nI mean obviously my original statements had not considered this depth of the conversation when I made them. But I'm glad we're going here. It's possible we can uncover some ideas about what goes on. \n\nFor example, there could be some middle ground being considered which makes targeted depopulation look like general depopulation. What if there is an equation let's say.. quality and quantity of goods produced will be negatively impacted by X amount depending on how much general population is culled. So at some point along the decline of living citizens, there is an equilibrium where an acceptable amount of impact on goods. Or services or whatever the labor pool does to create the value of money.. \n\nThen suddenly general depopulation is okay up to that X% mark. \n\nSo the question we have to ask now is how to overlay these mathematical ideas upon real events to create a patterned look at money, power and goods obtained. Then you create a paper trail to the players and boom. You've your yourself a good old fashioned general depopulation conspiracy theory.\n\nI would still need to see more than my half baked theories to give this any appreciation.\n\nInflation is a decent counter point to the whole idea that they care about the value of money at all based on goods. Maybe I'm getting lost in what ifs.",

Every other vaccine had been developed after the diseases became endemic. Typically viruses are easy to quarantine and treat to buy time to create a vaccine. \n\n2. Most modern vaccines were developed in the 20th century. The rapid advancements in computational immunology over the last 20 years have increased the efficiency in analyzing and sequencing data.\n\n3. COVID is one of the fastest spreading viruses in almost a century. It can't be contained and its novelty made treatment costly and burdensome for millions of people. The cheapest and most practical solution was a vaccine, which is indeed rarely ever the case, but a once-in-a-century pandemic definitely fits the definition of rare. \n\n>I don't think that a disease that has killed less than 500 people under the age of 5 should require toddlers to be vaccinated.\n\nThat's a fine opinion to have, but it's not exactly like anyone is forcing toddlers to get vaccinated. The chances of them dying are low, but honestly, 500 dead toddlers dying unnecessarily isn't something I'd be okay with. That's why health providers just recommend it, but if you want to take that risk for your child that's on you.  \n\n>If the vaccine had been deployed to nursing homes and other people who were at risk like diabetics and the obese then there would not have been so many questions. \n\nHealthcare workers and elderly all did get priority back in January 2021. I drove my grandmother to her appointment myself. \n\nIt would seem even more suspicious to deny the general public access to a vaccine that killed and hospitalized millions around the world. To answer the question, It's not like most governments are supporting vaccines because they care about you. It's because they are forced to deal with the repercussions of paying for people's medicare, stimulus packages, lockdowns are negatively impacting the economy but ignoring the virus is too overtly apathetic. Vaccine deployment means everyone gets back to work and buying shit so they can continue paying taxes. Just like severe hurricane warnings, it's more expensive to search for missing people than it is to just rebuild.",

The COVID vaccine was based on a formula for SARS. We already know what the long term effects would be because very little of the deployment of the vaccine is really all that unique. mRNA vaccines are actually much simpler compared to vaccines that use inactivated viruses because they can't pose the threat of accidentally spreading live versions of the virus they protect from. \n\nThe normal testing cycle of a vaccine is often dragged out largely due to bureaucracy, not efficacy. Truth is that most testing isn't actually concurrent. Five to six months is an insanely realistic timeframe to complete all three trials. \n\n>What your viewpoint argues is that a few doctors' testimonials on Good Morning America means that the science is settled.\n\nNever watched Good Morning America in my life.

You've told the government you don't give a fuck what they try, you're not having it.

We were made to think we were alone in not wanting the vaccine. To make us question our sanity at times. \n\nFor example, being the only person in a supermarket without a mask is not an easy thing to do. It's automatic to feel like you should just wear a mask, blend in and not make a scene. Humans are social creatures and don't want to risk being a loner and standing out from the crowd. That's why so many got injected. So you've got to forget all of that instinct and follow your principles, knowing that you're in the right.

Imo there was a rush put on to development of a medication to help fight virus. It was found that the sars2 spike protein was key to how virus gained access into cells. This being the case the vaccines were developed to replicate these proteins to trigger an immune response but we later discovered the impact these spike proteins have on our system ( interferes with DNA proteins responsible for self repair resulting in inflammation within the cells leading to numerous issues we are seeing now pop up in fairly young healthy people).but here's the real conspiracy\n We identified the risk of the spike protein before vaccines went into trails but it was decided to mute that info as it would put the project back another 6 months at least. So to save time and money big pharma tries to mute these findings. Some governments were complacent in that they also knew but sided with big pharma as they received  alot of campaign funding from big pharma profits. So yes , big government is in bed with big pharma and both chose profits over the health of their own citizens. Again the data and timeline suggests the vaccines were not intentionally designed to cause harm but rather a poor choice was made in it's design and once that was realized it was ignored due to potential profit losses combined with political pressure.",

In general I explore the status of Science, it's health as a method, and the status of Scientism which is destroying science.\n\nThe vaccine is a multipronged assault. The issue your husband is dealing with is inflammation in the brain. The mRNA and therefore spike protein can surpass the blood brain barrier. Inflammation can occur in the heart as myocarditis but in the brain as Alzheimer's, among many others.\n\nYou cannot undo the damage caused. Hearts should become far far more expensive as waiting lists grow in the next few years. As is self evident theseus's ship only goes so far. You cannot replace the brain of course. Not in the present at least.\n\nWhat you can do is take the things others have recommended. I took the horse paste ivermectin based on my body weight. In addition I took zinc and quinine via tonic water. I was having terrible chest pain after visiting vaccinated friends and one of those seems to have cleared it up. I cant comment on it's real efficacy, but make sure to verify doses. Zinc in a multivitamin is fine and tonic water containing quinine is perfectly safe. Ivermectin is a bit trickier and you have to dose by body weight. You can hurt yourself with this stuff.\n\nThe people recommending these approaches are using good science. Real cellular biology using proper terms, methods, and definitions. Their science checks out. Funnily enough the science on the other side checks out too, but they are being misleading with their terms, conclusions, and goals.",

It will only get worse in time as their slavery system gets worse and worse. The WEF works with Amazon and Bezos Zuckerberg Trudeau and tons of other corporations like BlackRock and more. So the biggest social media company in the world the large investment corporation. And the richest company in the world and one of the richest men. Looks a lot like they control almost everyone and everything to me. Of course we all have free will but they funnel us down certain paths to give us the illusion of choice but in reality they just want us as mindless drones marching down the path they put in place for us and then die. They get extremely upset when you stray too far from their path",

This argument comes up again and again because benign followers dont think like evil leaders. You are a benign follower. You think why would an evil leader kill a benign faithful follower like me???  Well, they believe they are so powerful, so influential --- and have been for so long -- that your personal ideology doesnt matter to them. They get away will murder, literal murder, all the time of those who try to go against them. Seth Rich is an example. Jamal Khashogi. And other untold mass atrocities.\n\nThey believe we are beneath them to such a high degree that it doesnt matter if you need to be forced into their desires or you do it willfully. They believe no matter what... their agenda will be realized. So selection of docile followers vs disobedient agitators doesnt matter. Because they think with power, no one can escape their plans.\n\nOnly benign follower would try to lead by pre-selecting for agreeableness and passivity lol. \n\nBecause they think of you like the Nazis think of the jews.

This prospective cohort study enrolled students   \nfrom two schools aged 13\u201318 years who received the second dose of the   \nBNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Data including demographics, symptoms,   \nvital signs, ECG, echocardiography and cardiac enzymes were collected at  \n baseline, Day 3, Day 7, and Day 14 (optional) using case record   \nforms.We enrolled 314 participants; of these, 13 participants were lost   \nto follow up, leaving 301 participants for analysis. The most common   \ncardiovascular effects were tachycardia (7.64%), shortness of breath   \n(6.64%), palpitation (4.32%), chest pain (4.32%), and hypertension   \n(3.99%). Seven participants (2.33%) exhibited at least one elevated   \ncardiac biomarker or positive lab assessments. Cardiovascular effects   \nwere found in 29.24% of patients, ranging from tachycardia, palpitation,  \n and myopericarditis. Myopericarditis was confirmed in one patient after  \n vaccination. Two patients had suspected pericarditis and four patients   \nhad suspected subclinical myocarditis. Conclusion: Cardiovascular   \neffects in adolescents after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination included  \n tachycardia, palpitation, and myocarditis. The clinical presentation of  \n myopericarditis after vaccination was usually mild, with all cases   \nfully recovering within 14 days. Hence, adolescents receiving mRNA   \nvaccines should be monitored for side effects.\"  \n\n\nNote that there is not a control group. Note that the study has just over 300 participants (not enough to be indicative of the population) and even then within that very small group we are looking at numbers like 7%, 2%, 4%...not exactly huge numbers. The \"study\" does absolutely nothing to test if the effects were caused by vaccine (this is why you want a control group who did not take the vaccine)  \n\n\nSo you take 300 kids from Thailand and out of those 300 12 of them reported feeling chest pain (when?) and that's the study? I don't know what kind of STEM courses are available in Thailand but this is a study that even a middle schooler in Biology class could tell you is fucked from the start. I hope nobody spent too much money doing this.",

Some are saline to increase profits and also to keep the first deaths and injuries down so more people would be encouraged to take the shot because the people who got the placebo will say shit like \"I got the jab and I'm fine so...\". \n\nAlso, keep in mind that just because someone got the jab and is fine now, that doesn't mean they will be in the long term, or that there aren't blood clots slowly forming on their blood right now.\n\nThe \"vaccine\" is actually meant to [depopulate the planet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXruPxsLc7o&t=3s) (among other things), since the people behind the whole plandemic (Bill Gates, WEF and so on) think there are way too many people on the planet."

We're giving about 1.07 million vaccine doses daily in the US, so we'd expect about 861 people per year to have a stroke within 8 hours of a vaccine dose. Of course, that's assuming everything is distributed randomly. Actual distribution of these things mean we'd expect the numbers to be higher.\n\nIt's like the claims that 48,000 people on Medicare died within two weeks after receiving the vaccine. ZOMG! Right?

The vax has been out there a long time. It's not like they can't find access or didn't get around to it. The number have been fairly constant at this point so it's not having to wait 6 weeks or so before the one dose people are eligible for the next dose.\n\nIt seems logical that they had a reaction bad enough to make them not want to continue onto the second dose. Some may have even been serious enough to require hospitalization, some may have died. Anyway, I'll leave you to ponder it.\n\nhttps://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/",

Essentially, due to the fact that COVID caused an enormous amount of excess deaths, some people who may not directly be labeled to COVID influenced death may have an altercation in which their death is wrongly attributed. However, the amount of people who actually died of COVID but were labeled as something OTHER than COVID on their death certificate is far greater than those who died from things other than COVID. \n\nI may have phrased it poorly, but unfortunately this kind of mistranslation of data and not understanding how statistics can sometimes be incorrectly calculated when on such a grandiose scale is how we\u2019ve gone made people believe the vaccine is some farce. \n\nThe fact that COVIDs mortality rate is lower than some other diseases (during the pinnacle time of social media echo chambers) is essentially the main reasons we\u2019re having this debate. People can\u2019t wrap their heads around how something could happen in a time like today with our medical advancements. It is merely a lack of anticipation on the governments parts for improperly preparing for a pandemic. \n\nShit like this has happened in the past and if this were an outbreak of polio or influenza (something with higher mortality rates) people would be clamoring at the doors for a vaccine no matter how rushed it is. We live in a time where being skeptical is an option.",

The amount of deaths is vanishingly small, virtually zero. Any professional will tell you this. If you're going to take VAERS at face value and declare it proof the vaccines are deadly, you'll never see a successful vaccine for the rest of your life. The next pandemic will show the exact same sort of numbers, guaranteed. Why? Because Vaers isn't showing vaccine injuries, just things that happened after the vaccine was taken. There is a difference, and any rational person can understand the difference. Can you?",

Lot of naturopathic doctors are indeed licensed, and in many cases have more years of school/training than traditional doctors. Some go through the same exact training that medical doctors go through, then go through additional years of training for the natural/holistic side. A lot of it just depends on the state you're in too. Some states don't recognize a naturopathic doctors license while others do. It also depends on the type of naturopath they are, as there are a few different types.",

Mike Adams, the Brighteon platform (TV, radio, podcasts/vids, social). These are all the folks at the cutting edge of this. \n\nSadly, if he'd had exposure to this kind of intel... he would've known better.

Why purposely try to confuse the public.  Why let the anti covax people have that ammo if it is easily refuted.   Why have another person pretend to be you.  Why is it no one has seen her anywhere.   Why did her husband change his fb to single.  Why was there a death notice listed for her.  I mean the more you dig the more obvious it is this girl is sadly deader than a doorknob.  I don't want her to be dead, I wish no one had been tricked into taking that poison.  Why so many people online talking about her being alive with zero proof.. WHy do you believe she is alive?  Can you provide proof that isn't an msm article saying she is alive and well.  Nope because she isn't.  I wish she was I really do.  It would be so simple for her to stop all the online talk about her.  So freaking simple.  If you wanted to hide from the public it would be sooo much easier to pop out say howdy and go on with your life.  People would forget all about her if she was proven without a shadow of a doubt to be alive and herself.  She would not be mentioned her anymore.  You wouldn't have to shiell about her being alive anymore.  You see how easy that would be and how much more beneficial that would be for her if she doesn't want contact or people talking about her. \" HI all, Its me Tiff.   I am not dead.... Look at me without my mask on todays date of....  Sorry I was away so long I am scared of the spotlight after volunteering to be in it on national tv.  Now that I am alive you can quit talking about me\"  That is all it would take.  We have seen photos of her.  No one will question if it is really her if it is.  No subterfuge no hiding her face.  Tiffany Dover.  Wouldn't take 15 second and she is out of the spotlight for good.  Nope she supposedly is in hiding from the scary people in the world and the press after VOLUNTEERING TO TAKE IT ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.  LOL   gmafb",

Well the commirnaty vaccine was never made available, they just kept distributing the same formula that was EAU approved, so that people too naive to research were thinking they were getting an FDA approved product.  While in reality they were still getting the same poison that was never fully approved, and never will be so they can never be held responsible for all the deaths and side effects their product causes.",

He was the builder who built Babel which later became Babylon. All false religion springs from that \"great city,\" hence the prostitute is known as \"the great city\" (Rev. 17:18). Ancient religions took drugs to communicate with the spirits as a part of their religious rites. Thus, pharmakeia (pharmaceuticals) is connected to spiritism.\n\nYou want to know the true identity of Babylon the Great and how she does indeed control much big business, religion, politics, science, entertainment, banking, education, the military and more? Her identity is a \"mystery\" to most people. (Rev. 17:5).

I've been retired since 2017 & now I sale Credit Card processing for small business'. \n\nI had been working for Portland Fire & Rescue for  about 3 years  when 9/11 happened.\n\n Immediately after, like the next Monday, I showed up at a Military Recruiters office to join the Marine Corps. I didn't care about the 50% pay cut. I didn't care about having to leave my great job for probably years at a time to live in a shit hole... About  6 weeks  before I was supposed to ship out, I fell off a ladder, & broke my back. (I Had to have a lower Lumbar Fusion at 28 years old.) I could no longer go to Basic. They wanted me to heal for 2 years, then go take a new physical. I never went. Looking back, that is probably the best thing that could have happened to me. At that time, I was so Gung Ho about quitting the Fire Dept if need be, (for years at a time), & becoming a Marine. I wanted to deploy, I wanted revenge for all of the Americans that had died that day. I was willing to die for America... \n\nAnyways, I had always trusted the Govt. I believed in the Iraq & Afghanistan War. I was a Patriot through & through... Then, about 5 or 6 years later in 2011, the Department hired a young lady who I became great friends with. She was young, in her early  20's & had been raised with the internet. The younger recruits in the fire service questioned everything, still respected authority, but wouldn't just go with the flow, things had to make sense. Orders had to make sense. I thought it was great for the Dept! She took me down a rabbit hole that I have still 12 years later, never pulled myself out of.\nShe showed me all this 9/11 evidence, that I believe proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that our Government (the one I so faithfully served & wanted to fight for)  planned & executed 9/11. \nShe showed me building 7, which I had never even heard of before I met her... \nI have been awake ever since. \n\nI was never a conspiracy guy, but since meeting this person, I don't believe shit the Government says. I pretty much assume Thwy are trying to control my every action & herd me & my family into some controllable box (a metaphorical box, not litteral) they want us to exist in. \n\nThe Government does whatever is nessecarry to appease the Ultra wealthy ppl that get them elected into their positions of power, & once they are there, Thwy do everything they possibly can to hold onto that power. \n\nCovid is 100% made in a lab. & Covid is just a trial run.\n\nEducate yourself on the atrocities of the Clinton's, Bush's, Obama's, Trump's, & especially Biden's...\n\nThey are ALL crooked & they are all controlled by higher evil powers. \n\nIt's not that bad being a crazy conspiracy person. \nI'm not taliki G about Bigfoot or Bases on Mars. \n\nI'm talking about an under wealthy  secret Cabal that wants to reduce the world population to below 1 billion people. They are paying the long game & Thwy are winning. \n\nAnyways, thanks for waking up! It's nice to have you with us!",

I apologize for any typos.\n\nAround November of 2020, my mom, brother, and me ended up catching Covid. My dad did catch it but it was very mild case. He was literally able to brush it off as a slight headache. It was kinda insane just because he technically was still recovering from health issues from the year before. \n\nFast forward to around Feb 2021, my dad got the vaccine without mentioning it to anyone. Caused a lot of drama with my mom who was/is very adamant against it. In a way, I know he got it to spite her but that\u2019s a whole other story\u2026\n\nAround March-April (sorry timeline is fuzzy) he ends up having a fainting spell which ends up sending him to the hospital. His heartbeat had become irregular and basically he had a mild stroke. He ends up getting a heart stent and then a stricter regiment of medications. Plus physical therapy.\n\nHe recovered for the most part. But his mind didn\u2019t.\n\nAfter that he just started making poor health decisions (not taking his meds for one) but after getting his booster, he regressed to an almost dementia like state.  Plus ended up having to have his heartbeat shocked as well as another stent. \n\nMost days he sits in a recliner in front of our front entryway. His limbs are completely filled with fluid because of retention. He has slurred speech patterns and can\u2019t remember a lot, including my name. He can\u2019t really do anything on his own and he refuses to take essential medications. Picks on my mom who is has become his caretaker essentially. \n\nLiterally dying. On borrowed time :/\n\nIt\u2019s insane because i\u2019m not saying it was purely the vaccines fault but my dad has, begrudgingly to me, has always seemed to have nine lives.  The man has recovered from some intense stuff.  I would never think that him getting the vaccine would land him in his current state, but that\u2019s what it seems like. One thing about him, prior to the stroke, he was always good about seeing a doctor and taking medications. He took them religiously actually. Which is why I assume he was in good health for a 70 y/o.\n\nSeeing him get like this, especially after getting the booster, it has made me really question what was in them. I\u2019m not against vaccines because i understand the science but i\u2019m scared of how greed corrupts the innocence behind that. I\u2019ve heard many cases of people having strokes/clotting.

I too experienced an adverse reaction to the booster but it was mild compared to a lot of these horror stories. I suddenly developed a skin condition called Dermatographia shortly after receiving the Moderna booster, and it was a pain in the ass until I found a competent allergist. Surprisingly, she actually admitted it was probably caused by the booster and that a lot of allergists at some convention she attended said they saw a huge uptick in Dermatographia after the booster was released. \n\nEven my CNN-chugging news-maniac mom was put off by it. Both my parents were fine from the boosters, thank God, but I'm so glad they aren't getting any more of them. I'm really glad they have the sense not to get any more of the shots after seeing the minor thing that happened to me. \n\nIt's devastating that big pharma and the world governments pushed these untested shots on so many people and killed many of them in the process. I'm very sorry your dad and your whole family has suffered so much because of that. I believe the whole \"Multiple shot\" approach was fucked from the start and I don't give a shit what any scientist, DoCtOr, or news puppet says. From what I saw, a lot of people got off lucky with the first 2 shots and the boosters are where things started getting really crazy. I stopped following it because no one in my family plans to get any more boosters, but I'm honestly terrified to see what happens once people start lining up for 4th, 5th, etc. I feel really stupid for taking the shot to begin with but I consider myself lucky for only getting the Dermatographia.",

He was bringing in about 20k a month, had a beautiful home, and a decent life overall. That all changed once he got his booster in December.\n\nHe went for his booster shot on 12/23 at 10AM. I arrived at his house at around 8PM to find him on the floor, unresponsive, covered in a pool of urine.\n\nCalled 911, brought him into the hospital. Told every doctor and nurse that he had gotten his booster about 8-10 hours ago, they all looked at me as if I was insane.\n\nTurns out my dad had a stroke. What are the odds my healthy father coincidentally has a stroke 8 hours after receiving his booster? Pretty damn slim. \n\nSince then, he\u2019s been a wreck. He hasn\u2019t been able to work, his cognitive state is decaying, his memory is awful, he has no motivation to do anything. He used to be a healthy active man, since the stroke he stopped cooking for himself, stopped exercising, eats like shit, and hasn\u2019t been able to return to his job. He\u2019s now back in the hospital for a blood clot in his leg and narrowly missed amputation. He is going to have no choice but to sell his home as he cannot continue to afford it with no income.\n\nThank you big pharma for ruining my fathers life! And taking away from mine.

Fuck Pfizer, fuck Moderna, and fuck all the corrupt assholes who are getting rich and living with no stress while the middle class citizens suffer. Fuck you!!!!\n\nTLDR: fuck the CDC/WHO for shoving this rushed vaccine down our throat and banning other alternatives like ivermectin. All about the Benjamin I guess"

Obviously because of governments MSM and pharmaceutical companies power and money you will always have more articles positive about the jab. I am double vaxx (was forced to be in my country) but my problem is that I know IRL 4 young perfectly healthy people who had severe side effets with the jab. One went BLIND for hours after the booster . One had such hypotension that he had to stay in ICU for days ! One has fibromyalgia after the booster . And TWO had pericarditis after the jab. I know you can have all that with covid . But jab obviously doesn\u2019t prevent you from getting covid and very bad symptoms . Yes it might help some really old unhealthy people. But what is the point of getting a jab when you are young ? You can get bad side effects from the jab and still you can catch covid and have bad symptoms from it. At best it is partially useful for really old and sick people. That\u2019s it. I do love science . I am vaxx . But it doesn\u2019t stop me from being worried especially because all those people I know IRL who had bad bad side effects. I am on earth since 40 yo. Never ever knew someone with pericarditis or going blind after a vaccine before . So please be open minded if you really like science you should accept that we don\u2019t know everything yet.

I\u2019ve concluded a few things. \n1) People with kids or around kids catch a lot more illnesses in general than people who are not around kids as much. These people vaccinated or not get sick more often. \n2) People who are exposed to more germs in general don\u2019t seem to get as sick from Covid because their immune systems are primed. \n3) Those who live with excessive fear and stress tend to have worse side effects from Covid because stress lowers your immune system. Most people who are unvaccinated are not living in fear of the virus.\n4) I\u2019ve seen both people who are vaxxed and boosted not catch Covid and simultaneously vaxxed and boosted who catch Covid multiple times and frequently. I don\u2019t personally know of any unvaccinated people who have had Covid frequently (some stories of people catching the OG Covid and omicron but that\u2019s about it). \n5) This is a big one. People who are unvaccinated tend to look at alternative treatments that are not mainstream more than vaccinated people do. For example, vitamins and other repurposed drugs are used and likely have success in lessening the Covid symptoms (even as simple as using vitamin D). Vaccinated people tend to solely depend on the power of their vaccines. \n6) Everyone seems to experience Covid differently. \n7) My personal experience, my family and I (all unvaccinated at the time) caught Omicron and faired better than many of my vaxxed and boosted friends and family. We all took vitamins during and they did not. I had to take Novavax for work recently, so I may come back and report if I catch Covid again (as a comparison of whether I faired better unvaxxed or vaxxed).",

Since the d day his mind has not been the same. Lots of confusion. Never seen him have so many problems in his life. My mom got it too. She had heart palpitations a few days after her first booster. They got worse in the coming days. Then they got so severe she thought she was having a heart attack. She went to the hospital but by then the palpitations faded. They referred her to a cardiologist. She saw him and he had no answers for her. Since then she has gotten every booster. She's now been sick for 5 days after giving me covid on sunday. My symptoms kicked in last night. The extent of my symptoms are: mildly sore back, mildly sore eyes, and mild fatigue. I worked in my shop yesterday, took two walks and finally felt tired by the evening. I've slept like a baby every night. Feeling better today than last night. Unvaccinated. Mildly worn out for 2 days and will most likely be on the mend tomorrow. -crossing fingers-",

That\u2019s fine, although you should have to deal with the decision. Currently science shows Covid can be really bad for some. So if you didn\u2019t get vaxed and end up being one of those that get it bad i feel my tax dollars shouldn\u2019t go to trying to save you from Covid. if I end up having a heart attack and die because of the vaccine i have no Ill will towards you, and you were right. One point I\u2019m trying to make is usually the simplest explanation is the right one. Which is the vaccine has side effects but they are not part of the \u201cplan\u201d. Although my main point was stating that if you claim that someone inflated the death rates to make Covid look worse than it was, how can you not think someone would do the same for the vaccine side effects.",

All our co-workers and vaxxed family seem to have at least a small regret for getting the jab. Has made us rather grateful for staying away from it. Not to mention all the unprecedented questions being asked by the people, who in the beginning did nothing but try to convince everyone that it was safe, only to go back on those words after administration.

You're living in a fantasy land constructed by the billionaire owned media, the same media funded by big pharma, that is doing everything in their power to convince gullible people that the government needs more power and control over the markets.

So maybe 36-42 hours? I stayed up front with the kids. My mom talked to the coroner, but she was still in shock and was a hot mess coming out the back after talking to him. I'm not crystal clear on the details of their discussion because she was an emotional wreck for the following two weeks after and she gets emotionally furious anytime I try to talk about it with her. We are still packing up my sister's house which has been devastating my mom and the kids.

And it's gone up considerably, very quickly, for the longest time basic cremation, without viewing, was pretty standard around $800.. now, well depending on where you live, it usually starts, and quickly exceeds $1500+\n\n\nMy home is located in a fairly large city, and we predominantly work with unclaimed, unwanted and the.. unrich, so I get to see every type of elements. And we do not discriminate. Our standard, bare bones, straight to the fire, is approx. $1000-1200. Now that includes filing all the paperwork, (ordering extra death certificates, which does cost money but not much, etc),  removal and storing of the body, and the processing of the cremains. Now a lot of our clients qualify for state assistance which basically covers most of the cost. \n\nMy questions for you are, were you told about you possibly qualifying for state assistance, to help cover some of the costs?  I will not assume your financial situation, but we always discuss this as an option, regardless of whether they believe they would qualify or not, and sometimes they do when they never thought they would. So we basically always check if we think there is a fraction they might. \nWere you able to have a viewing, this typically is just like a funeral wake, but instead of a casket, there is an urn. Also, did you purchase an urn? If you chose to have your sisters remains returned to you in an urn, these can be pretty expensive. When you do a standard cremation, without an urn ordered, you would receive usually a temporary plastic container with a bag holding the cremains. Some opt to order their own specific urn and we will gladly accept that and transfer for you without charge, so the family doesn't have to. Also, sometimes we have family's chose the embalming to cremation package, which same as a wake, but instead of gravesite burial after, we take the body to be cremated, the embalming process adds a substantial amount of cost, so if you had any of these it could all pad the cost, but if what you had was a very quick death, to cremation, I would have questions. \n\nAlso, what were the amount of days between death and cremation? Because while yes, there is a RUSH standard that happens on occasion, you legally can not even cremate within 48 hours of death, a fully completed final disposition is required, and most importantly a Permit! And it all takes time. So timeline is important here also. And depending on which state, the body must be viewed by a ME from the county in which the person died, (if your sister was recovered from a Medical Examiners office, this was already done). All of these things need to happen before one is cremated, so as you might guess, it can be a process. Sometimes, very very rarely, all aligns just perfect and the body goes quite quickly, but your sister's situation seems very unusual?.. not to sound all conspiracy. I hope this helps a little and wasn't to ranty",

Thing is, your macrophages don't know it's waste, and ignores it doesn't get rid of it. Gee. What would some useless heap of \"immune response\" do over time if you kept making it over react, via cytokine storm, and then just clumped these useless wrongly folding proteins all in one area.

It *is* in fact a depopulation tool.\n\nBut it\u2019s more than that still.\n\n> If they full out said only people 60+ need to be vaccinated, it would make more sense because from a farming perspective, the old cows consume more (food, veterinary care, etc.) but don\u2019t produce enough milk anymore to offset the cost, AND there happen to be a lot of those 60+ cows because you had a \u201ccow boom\u201d 60 years ago.\n\nNot bad points, but the \u201cfarmer/cow\u201d analogy applies only so far.  Humans might be said to be a bit more complicated a species than bovines (only *might*, however.  I\u2019m actually not completely sure).  If they (we) *are* more complicated and intelligent than cows, then it would stand to reason that the means to use to depopulate the human herd would have to be a bit more complicated and not as simplistic as just shoving all the old cow-humans into the meat grinder of an overt depopulation effort using an injection that the other members of the herd would be easily able to see is a means to kill them.  That would potentially cause a global stampede/revolt that would be not-too-easy to keep down.\n\nSo tptb-farmers gotta use deeper psyops on the human cows.\n\n> The baby cows are your future milk-makers, and the young adults are your current milk-makers.\n\nWhat tptb are doing to the young right now is totally in line with an m.o. that says \u201cKill a good portion of them and enslave/control the rest that remain.\u201d\n\nThere will still be enough livestock left over to allow tptb to keep making money off the masses even after killing a good portion of the young and old alike.\n\n> If the goal was mass depopulation, they would just poison the water supply. So there must be a target.\n\nThe goal *isn\u2019t* just mass depopulation.  The goal is \u201ctrimming the hedges of that unruly bush called humanity and making sure the rest of the foliage stays controlled.\u201d\n\n> I keep thinking maybe it\u2019s NOT the vaccines killing people off\n\nIt is - at least in part.  The injections are definitely not the *only* thing - but they are no small part of the equation for sure.\n\n> So, there\u2019s definitely something up with the vaccines.\n\nYes, sir.  Definite manipulative fuckery has been afoot for a while now (if not for the entirety of human existence on this planet).",

Unfortunately, not many others did, and here we are, vaccinating children who have zero percent chance of severe disease, camps in Australia, dictatorship in Canada, and a 40% increase in all cause mortality with \"experts\" making up reasons why young adults can suddenly die.

Which is not the case and is, literally, the exact opposite of how to approach something using the scientific method. \n\nUntil a month ago, I could have said the same thing you just did, except I got the vaccine. However, my mom is a nurse, has covid patients, and got exposed. I got it from her. I can't blame the vaccine one way or another. They say it only lasts 3-6 months, so is it my fault I got sick because I didn't take a third? Or, from the other hand, would I have even gotten covid if I was never vaccinated? \n\nWell, we can't say for sure. We can sit here and guessimate until we are blue in the face, but right now no one on either side is right about everything. At the end of the day, it's just a whataboutism that isn't concrete in any definition of the word. \n\nAt the end of the day, let people make their choices and live with them. If I die in 3 years because I got a vaccine, that's on me. I can deal with that being my responsibility and my problem. Do I think the vaccine situation is fishy? Absolutely, I have from the start, but my dad is 80 years old and I try to be around him as much as possible. So I made the decision that if i have to shorten my life to avoid going 2+ years without being able to see my elderly father, that's worth it in my book. Does that mean everyone has to have the same conclusion and perspective as me? Again, of course not.",

The mrna has about 500 genes, which is about as much code as 4 integers on a computer.\n\nMrna gets into a persons cells and those cells produce covid spike proteins.  Our bodies immune system notices those proteins and creates memory t cells for when we encounter the real virus.\n\nThe stage 3 clinical trial of both mrna vaccines had about 30,000 participants.  The trials were conducted by third parties.  Other governments conducted their own independent studies.  They found high safety and efficacy at p<0.00002.  p is how much they trust the study.

For about 2 years we wore masks everywhere we went. For 2 years with 3 kids under 10 and not even a sniffle. That's insane! Under normal circumstances kids get sick all the time because their immune system is in training. \n\nMarch 2022. My younger twins bring home Covid from preschool because it's hard to keep 4 year olds wearing masks all day. We were out of commission for about a week. But my wife and I decided to \"go back to normal\". Since we were both triple jabbed and our oldest was also vaccinated. Now that we'd had Covid on top of that we felt that our immunity was about as good as it could get. Plus watching Covid literally bounce off my 4 year olds (despite them not being vaccinated) did wonders for our fear level. \n\nSo we stopped wearing masks, as the mandates were lifting in my area around that time. Kids went back into sports, we started going to birthday parties and BBQ's again. Now we're paying for the 2 years of not breathing in people's germs. \n\nOur immunity is down for just about everything. My kids have been bringing home viruses on a weekly basis. We've had all manner of colds, pretty sure a couple different strains fo the Flu and even a couple bouts of Norovirus ran through our house in the last 4 months. Kids have been constantly sick.\n\nMy wife and I are getting through it ok. Because we're adults and our immunity is at a higher level because we'e older. Under normal circumstances I'll get sick maybe once a year with a sinus infection or 2 sprinkled in. This year (since I had covid) I've been significantly ill 3 times with sicknesses that weren't Covid. That's not normal. But it's not because of the vaccine, it's because I wore a mask in public and isolated myself somewhat during the 2 years of Covid.\n\nIt ain't rocket science. Most people who got jabbed probably also wore masks and tried to isolate for 2 years. We all dropped the masks and went back to normal so other viruses are having a field day with our lower immunity. My guess is it'll be a rough winter with respiratory illnesses like the Flu. But next season our immunity will all be back to normal and people won't be getting sick as much. I'll be making sure to get my Covid booster and Flu shot before the colder months this year for sure.",

As these cytotoxic CD8+ T cells enable prompt abrogation of productive infection and as this epitope is shared amongst some other glycosylated viruses causing acute self-limiting infection or disease, more and more cases of asymptomatic infections are to be expected in vaccinees, especially in those endowed with a mature and fully functional innate immune system.",

Talking specifically about known heart conditions that can cause heart failure and using genetic testing to find these issues. Nothing about vaccinations. \n\nThe third doesn\u2019t tell that much but the final paragraph: \u201cThe issue of excess deaths from COVID-19 vaccination is a scientifically difficult question, conditioned by the type of vaccines and the composition of vaccinated people in age and health.8 Although deaths following COVID-19 vaccination had been recorded worldwide, their rates were still much lower than the mortality rates following an outbreak. Vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent severe cases and deaths from COVID-19. Unblocking to resume normal life can only be facilitated by herd immunity with a high coverage of vaccination.\u201d\n\nEdit: From the first article: \u201cHe said the data shows COVID deaths are greatly understated among working age Americans. \u201c",

Yet the left only wants to protect children from guns, not sexual predators.\n\nI personally don't care about the whole marijuana debate, but the fact that several Democrat-run cities have decriminalized heroin, crack, fentanyl, opioids, and numerous other extremely dangerous drugs leads me to believe that they're not about protecting the people, unless \"the people\" in that statement refers to the drug cartels that pay for open borders.\n\nAs for abortion, that was re-relegated to the states. Live in a state that bans abortion? Vote accordingly, or move to a more \"progressive\" state. Same can be said of all the above. And with those \"freedoms\" (translated as removal of accountability for ones own actions), you also get the cities with the highest crime rates, largest homeless populations, and most significant government overreach - like California's restrictions on ICE vehicles, water usage, rolling brownouts, and citizen mandates (that Newsom conveniently gets to ignore).\n\nYou can pretend all you want that these things are \"progressive\", but you'll have to ignore the urban decay and sidestep the shit on the sidewalk while doing so.",

When a company gets such a massive boost in profits as the pharmaceutical companies got from the vaccine, they kinda need to keep those percentages up, so if they made a cure all vaccine, it would just make them a 1 time big bag, and they need consistent growth in profits.

They poured enormous resources into this operation and they've been preparing for years.\n\nI get it you got deceived by state and corporate propaganda into taking the vaxx and are inclined to defend it now but we must honor truth above all and stay as objective as possible.\n\nPS: Wow, if I needed more proof this sub is flooded by shills and \"disinformation agents\" I certainly got it with the down votes for stating verifiable facts.",

Someone wanted lots of people to die and take as many others out with them as possible.\n\nAlso, this didn't stem from any single government or entity. The Chinese were alone in releasing it, and I don't think individual governments made the calls on how it was handled either.\n\nThis pandemic resulted in lots of cash bring funneled upward. That's no coincidence. It's never a coincidence.\n\nSo yeah, there's lots of bullshit surrounding the narrative we've been fed about COVID, but the vaccine isn't one.

What I'm most flabbergasted at is that in the majority of the MD notes, there's specific mention that the ClotShot was ruled out as a cause. That's amazing, as there ***IS*** no way to rule it out. No test, no lab, no blood level.\n\nClimate change is obviously to blame for the world's 18-49 year olds having a 40% increase in morbidity and mortality OF ALL CAUSES starting in 2021. Totally not the experimental injections. \n\nNever forget your benevolent overlords forced people to get these, and those who refused often had their life ruined. \n\nAnd your \"friends\" neighbors and \"loved ones\" fucking CHEERED the destruction of their lives cuz they were grandma killing psycopaths who deserve to die slowly and be denied healthcare. And it's still going on. Even though it's proven that mRNA \"vaccines\" lower your immune response to levels below that of the unvaxxed in a matter of weeks.

I have a medical condition that requires a prescription that I simply cannot afford without insurance. I went online, found a bunch of decent jobs to apply foe, and did. Then, after I got a few offers I picked one. I had a new job lined up before I quit my old job. There was no period when I had no insurance. Chances are, if you're working a job with benefits, you have a skill that will allow you to find another job relatively easily. \n\nI understand, moving a family across the country isn't convenient. But let's be 100% honest here. Most people chose convenience over their so-called principles. \n\nThey also could have filed for medical or religious exemptions, and fought the fight in court. Like many people did.\n\nThey also could have got fake vaccine cards, like many people did.\n\nWhat I am sick of, is people allowing themselves to become victimized, and then expecting great sympathy. I am not exceptional. Anyone could have done what I did. They chose to become victims instead. \n\n>\"Jewish people didn't HAVE to get on the trains and go to concentration camps. They had a choice. They could have chosen to get shot instead.\" \n\nThey could have chosen to run, hide or fight, like many of them did choose. It wasn't like there weren't dozens and dozens of red flags and warnings before the Nazis started murdering them.\n\nI get it. The fact that they had a choice doesn't justify the actions of the Nazis. Nor does it justify the actions of our government and corporations.

The problem is that the illegal orders are coming from the top and there are too many senior ranking officers who don\u2019t have a spine to fight it.  And almost all these members put in for exemptions.  To my knowledge the only religious exemptions were from members that were on there way out anyway.  The only FDA approved covid19 vaccine is COMIRNATY which they don\u2019t have any supplies of.  One good officer got an exemption based on this very important fact.  I might know a thing or two about the U.S. military.  I retired after 22 years of service in 2013.  Even way way back in boot camp they explained the difference between legal and illegal orders and that it was our duty to not follow illegal ones.  The military that are being forced separated for not following illegal orders are heroes in my book.  They knew the risk for doing the right thing and took it anyway.  They need to be reinstated with all back pay and also missed promotions.",

In 2019 we had technology that we discovered that is really effective at killing the original and various varients in 1 shot. This is due to a revolutionary technique where the stem of a virus cell is targeted rather than its spike. Covid being a respritory illness also follows a similiar path of infection as the flu does. Both are known for high mutation rates which means likely varients to pop up. Now instead of developing this we went with mrna. Why? Way easier to scale like how its easier to get concrete than carbon nano tubes. This being a cheaper and quick to production product. They went with that.  I'm sure you have noticed the booster campaign in full swing which is causing these companies to explode in sales. They were taught a lesson that just raising the prices was too dangerous for public image \"gentlemen responsible just created a crypto thing as well related to health of course\" and then went to find another way to increase sales without the public being as mad.",

People keeps repeating he would do a military coup to close the congress but we had 2 national holidays (September 7th) that it would be possible and he didn't do it. And the ex-president Lula is trying to become president again (after going out of jail). As he threw tons of commodities money into bankers (in 2008), I think there's a plan for him to win (even altering the votes' results). He think it was easy to rule but at that time commodities was in a HIGH moment (economically speaking, we won a lot by the USA crisis and we exported TONS shit of food).. Last but not least: Lula is the one who wants to control/regulate the media(in our case, the brazilian MSM).

They very clearly said that if we get the first two jabs, we are protected, cannot spread the virus, etc. If that is not true, then they admit they deliberately lied and thus cannot be trusted. And if it is true, then we have no reason to go along with this booster or \"updated vaccine\" nonsense.\n\nBasically you have to go full 1984 and forget the past and just listen to whatever big brother says *now* in order to end up obeying to them lol.",
