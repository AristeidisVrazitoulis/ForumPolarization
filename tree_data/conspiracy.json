When a company gets such a massive boost in profits as the pharmaceutical companies got from the vaccine, they kinda need to keep those percentages up, so if they made a cure all vaccine, it would just make them a 1 time big bag, and they need consistent growth in profits. Cue planned obsolescence. Most vaccines don\u2019t need a follow up fucking jab every 1/2-1 year. This is bullshit. Follow the money not your illogical paranoia.",

We would all be dead before we saw this manufacturer info if not for a court order releasing their data. \n\nYes mRNA medicine research has benn around for decades but if you can please share how many mRNA based medicines made it to market before these vaccines came along I would love for everyone to know. I know of none personally when I did my own info gahering, because the medicines all had problems in development.\n\nFact is, there is zero long term clinical data studying the vaccines yet and you are the test subject. I do sincerely hope there is no serious long term effects for those vaxxed, and tend to be more optimistic than the OP.",

Someone wanted lots of people to die and take as many others out with them as possible.\n\nAlso, this didn't stem from any single government or entity. The Chinese were alone in releasing it, and I don't think individual governments made the calls on how it was handled either.\n\nThis pandemic resulted in lots of cash bring funneled upward.

Chances are, if you're working a job with benefits, you have a skill that will allow you to find another job relatively easily. \n\nI understand, moving a family across the country isn't convenient.

Like many people did.\n\nThey also could have got fake vaccine cards, like many people did.\n\nWhat I am sick of, is people allowing themselves to become victimized, and then expecting great sympathy. I am not exceptional. Anyone could have done what I did. They chose to become victims instead. \n\n>\"Jewish people didn't HAVE to get on the trains and go to concentration camps. They had a choice. They could have chosen to get shot instead.\" \n\nThey could have chosen to run, hide or fight, like many of them did choose. It wasn't like there weren't dozens and dozens of red flags and warnings before the Nazis started murdering them.\n\nI get it.

It's not just, \"It's against my religion.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Conway Regional Health System has required the flu shot annually as part of employment, but managers saw a spike in vaccine exemption requests for the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cThis was significantly disproportionate to what we\u2019ve seen with the influenza vaccine,\u201d Matt Troup, president and CEO of the health system, told Becker\u2019s.\n\n***The majority of requests cited the use of fetal cell lines in the development of vaccines as part of the religious exemption.*** The practice uses cells grown in labs to test many new vaccines and drugs, including common antacids and cold medications.\n\n***\u201cThus, we provided a religious attestation form for those individuals requesting a religious exemption,\u201d*** Troup said.\n\n***The hospital\u2019s form includes a list of 30 common medications that used fetal cell lines during research and development. The list includes acetaminophen, albuterol, aspirin, ibuprofen, Tylenol, Pepto Bismol, Tums, Lipitor, Senokot, Motrin, Maalox, Ex-Lax, Benadryl, Sudafed, Preparation H, Claritin, Prilosec, and Zoloft.***\n\n[https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20210918/some-medications-also-tied-to-religious-vaccine-exemption](https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20210918/some-medications-also-tied-to-religious-vaccine-exemption)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"This was significantly disproportionate to what we've seen with the influenza vaccine. ***Thus, we provided a religious attestation form for those individuals requesting a religious exemption,\" he said. \"The intent of the religious attestation form is twofold: to ensure staff requesting exemption are sincere in their beliefs and to educate staff who might have requested an exemption without understanding the full scope of how fetal cells are used in testing and development in common medicines.\"***\n\nConway Regional said the form also aims to notify employees of the requirements for compliance for an exemption, including signing the attestation form confirming their sincerely held belief, being subject to periodic COVID-19 testing, and possible reassignment to another position to mitigate risk to patients and staff.\n\n***The form lists 30 medications and asks employees to \"truthfully acknowledge and affirm that my sincerely held religious belief is consistent and true and I do not use or will use any of the medications listed as examples or any other medication \u2026 that has used fetal cell lines in their development and/or testing.\"***\n\n***Few religions outright reject vaccinations***, but some religious groups have raised the issue of vaccines being developed and tested on fetal cell lines, which are grown in labs based on aborted fetal cells, according to 9News, which spoke with an infectious disease expert at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.\n\n\"I understand why people have concerns,\" James Lawler, MD, the expert, who is a practicing Catholic, told the news station. ***\"The bottom line is almost all the medical products we use have in some way been touched by research that's been done on fetal cell lines.\"***\n\nMr. Troup said the purpose of the form is to be educational and \"provide information on other commonly used medications that may go against a sincerely held religious belief.\"\n\nIf someone declines to sign the form, he said their religious exemption is approved on a provisional basis, and the employee may be asked to sign the form at a later date.\n\n[https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/workforce/prove-it-hospital-asks-unvaccinated-employees-claiming-religious-exemption.html](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/workforce/prove-it-hospital-asks-unvaccinated-employees-claiming-religious-exemption.html)",

Even way way back in boot camp they explained the difference between legal and illegal orders and that it was our duty to not follow illegal ones.

This is due to a revolutionary technique where the stem of a virus cell is targeted rather than its spike. Covid being a respritory illness also follows a similiar path of infection as the flu does. Both are known for high mutation rates which means likely varients to pop up. Now instead of developing this we went with mrna. Why? Way easier to scale like how its easier to get concrete than carbon nano tubes. This being a cheaper and quick to production product. They went with that.  I'm sure you have noticed the booster campaign in full swing which is causing these companies to explode in sales. They were taught a lesson that just raising the prices was too dangerous for public image \"gentlemen responsible just created a crypto thing as well related to health of course\" and then went to find another way to increase sales without the public being as mad.",

The vax has been out there a long time. It's not like they can't find access or didn't get around to it. The number have been fairly constant at this point so it's not having to wait 6 weeks or so before the one dose people are eligible for the next dose.\n\nIt seems logical that they had a reaction bad enough to make them not want to continue onto the second dose. Some may have even been serious enough to require hospitalization, some may have died. Anyway, I'll leave you to ponder it.\n\nhttps://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/",

Essentially, due to the fact that COVID caused an enormous amount of excess deaths, some people who may not directly be labeled to COVID influenced death may have an altercation in which their death is wrongly attributed. However, the amount of people who actually died of COVID but were labeled as something OTHER than COVID on their death certificate is far greater than those who died from things other than COVID. \n\nI may have phrased it poorly, but unfortunately this kind of mistranslation of data and not understanding how statistics can sometimes be incorrectly calculated when on such a grandiose scale is how we\u2019ve gone made people believe the vaccine is some farce. \n\nThe fact that COVIDs mortality rate is lower than some other diseases (during the pinnacle time of social media echo chambers) is essentially the main reasons we\u2019re having this debate. People can\u2019t wrap their heads around how something could happen in a time like today with our medical advancements. It is merely a lack of anticipation on the governments parts for improperly preparing for a pandemic. \n\nShit like this has happened in the past and if this were an outbreak of polio or influenza (something with higher mortality rates) people would be clamoring at the doors for a vaccine no matter how rushed it is.

Doctors and nurses have all the tools available to provide evidence as to what could potentially cause a medical issue. The implication here is not that doctors are not allowed to talk about \"misinformation\" but that they are actively working to hide and lie about the severity of COVID victims and hide information about severe adverse reactions to vaccines. The same would go for academics who monitor patient records or conduct their own independant studies.

If masks were to protect the surgeon from the patient's fluids spattering on them, why then wouldn't they just wear face shields, which would prevent fluids from getting into their eyes?  Are they just afraid of getting gross stuff in their mouth, but the eyes are ok?  Is that how blood communicable diseases work, only infecting you through the mouth and nose?  \n\nCould this be that they actually use masks to prevent spitting or sneezing into a patient's open wound during surgery?  If you sneezed into a face shield, which is not form fitting to your chin, doesn't the liquid follow the path of gravity...down?  Why would they wear masks for over 24 hours in some surgeries, if they couldn't breathe through them?",

States should delay further reopening until mask mandates are fully implemented, and enforcement by local businesses will be critical for preventing potential future closures.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2?fbclid=IwAR0Q3-WhHv1F9dmZSr2iLNQ-F6ioAIfOYAch7PPtHib9EsuVyhs-mYZlXcg\n\n>We detected coronavirus in respiratory droplets and aerosols in 3 of 10 (30%) and 4 of 10 (40%) of the samples collected without face masks, respectively, but did not detect any virus in respiratory droplets or aerosols collected from participants wearing face masks,\n\n\nhttps://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf\n\n>The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts.

Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020.

He did a lot of terrible things to me in 2019, and I had, more then enough reason to never talk to him again, but I decided to be the bigger person.

If you're going to take VAERS at face value and declare it proof the vaccines are deadly, you'll never see a successful vaccine for the rest of your life.

Steamed hams baby. Not only that but none of these comments, none of them can be verified. You want to believe them, then do it, nobody's stopping you. But the likelihood is very low that all of these are as a result of the vaccine. Sure, reactions happen but that they all congregate here, unlikely. It's more likely bots due to the fact there's a post like this every other week at peak hours for visibility.

If everyone is soooo convinced she is still kicking around somewhere why not a simple bit of proof.  Why go on national tv and then hide from the public and never make a comment again. Why purposely try to confuse the public.  Why let the anti covax people have that ammo if it is easily refuted.   Why have another person pretend to be you.  Why is it no one has seen her anywhere.   Why did her husband change his fb to single.  Why was there a death notice listed for her.  I mean the more you dig the more obvious it is this girl is sadly deader than a doorknob.  I don't want her to be dead, I wish no one had been tricked into taking that poison.  Why so many people online talking about her being alive with zero proof.. WHy do you believe she is alive?  Can you provide proof that isn't an msm article saying she is alive and well.  Nope because she isn't.  I wish she was I really do.  It would be so simple for her to stop all the online talk about her.  So freaking simple.  If you wanted to hide from the public it would be sooo much easier to pop out say howdy and go on with your life.  People would forget all about her if she was proven without a shadow of a doubt to be alive and herself.  She would not be mentioned her anymore.  You wouldn't have to shiell about her being alive anymore.  You see how easy that would be and how much more beneficial that would be for her if she doesn't want contact or people talking about her. \" HI all, Its me Tiff.   I am not dead.... Look at me without my mask on todays date of....  Sorry I was away so long I am scared of the spotlight after volunteering to be in it on national tv.  Now that I am alive you can quit talking about me\"  That is all it would take.  We have seen photos of her.  No one will question if it is really her if it is.  No subterfuge no hiding her face.  Tiffany Dover.  Wouldn't take 15 second and she is out of the spotlight for good.  Nope she supposedly is in hiding from the scary people in the world and the press after VOLUNTEERING TO TAKE IT ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.  LOL   gmafb",

Pretty damn slim. \n\nThe chances of your father having something bad happen coincidental with something else is slim, but the chances of someone having that happen is guaranteed thousands of times over. And your father has low probabilities chances all the time. High likelihood something would happen. \n\n\nFor example, every year, 800,000 people have a stroke. That is 2,500 strokes per day. Last year, 70% of the population had boosters and doses, so 3 total days of coincidental times. With a flat distribution,  that means just by chance, about 5,000 people had strokes within a day of the shot. Same for heart attacks. That is also 800,000/year.\n\nSo that means, just by chance, 10,000 people had either a stroke or heart attack within 1 day of getting a vaccine dose, even if the vaccine dose was just a placebo.\n\n1 degree of separation with immediate family, that means about 100,000 people last year had a close family member that had a heart attack or stroke within 1 day of the vaccine.\n\nAdd +100,000 for every extra day you count since the vaccine. Within a week? 3/4 of a million people had that correlation with no causal effect.\n\nGo up 50% more if you count dangerous blood clots like some other posters here.",

I believe each Emergency authorization lasts 6 months.  If you remember about a year ago the FDA granted full approval to the Pfizer commirnaty vaccine.  Well the commirnaty vaccine was never made available, they just kept distributing the same formula that was EAU approved, so that people too naive to research were thinking they were getting an FDA approved product.  While in reality they were still getting the same poison that was never fully approved, and never will be so they can never be held responsible for all the deaths and side effects their product causes.",

He was the builder who built Babel which later became Babylon. All false religion springs from that \"great city,\" hence the prostitute is known as \"the great city\" (Rev. 17:18). Ancient religions took drugs to communicate with the spirits as a part of their religious rites. Thus, pharmakeia (pharmaceuticals) is connected to spiritism.\n\nYou want to know the true identity of Babylon the Great and how she does indeed control much big business, religion, politics, science, entertainment, banking, education, the military and more?

I've been retired since 2017 & now I sale Credit Card processing for small business'. \n\nI had been working for Portland Fire & Rescue for  about 3 years  when 9/11 happened.\n\n Immediately after, like the next Monday, I showed up at a Military Recruiters office to join the Marine Corps. I didn't care about the 50% pay cut. I didn't care about having to leave my great job for probably years at a time to live in a shit hole... About  6 weeks  before I was supposed to ship out, I fell off a ladder, & broke my back. (I Had to have a lower Lumbar Fusion at 28 years old.) I could no longer go to Basic. They wanted me to heal for 2 years, then go take a new physical. I never went. Looking back, that is probably the best thing that could have happened to me. At that time, I was so Gung Ho about quitting the Fire Dept if need be, (for years at a time), & becoming a Marine. I wanted to deploy, I wanted revenge for all of the Americans that had died that day. I was willing to die for America... \n\nAnyways, I had always trusted the Govt. I believed in the Iraq & Afghanistan War. I was a Patriot through & through... Then, about 5 or 6 years later in 2011, the Department hired a young lady who I became great friends with. She was young, in her early  20's & had been raised with the internet. The younger recruits in the fire service questioned everything, still respected authority, but wouldn't just go with the flow, things had to make sense. Orders had to make sense. I thought it was great for the Dept! She took me down a rabbit hole that I have still 12 years later, never pulled myself out of.\nShe showed me all this 9/11 evidence, that I believe proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that our Government (the one I so faithfully served & wanted to fight for)  planned & executed 9/11. \nShe showed me building 7, which I had never even heard of before I met her... \nI have been awake ever since. \n\nI was never a conspiracy guy, but since meeting this person, I don't believe shit the Government says. I pretty much assume Thwy are trying to control my every action & herd me & my family into some controllable box (a metaphorical box, not litteral) they want us to exist in. \n\nThe Government does whatever is nessecarry to appease the Ultra wealthy ppl that get them elected into their positions of power, & once they are there, Thwy do everything they possibly can to hold onto that power. \n\nCovid is 100% made in a lab. & Covid is just a trial run.\n\nEducate yourself on the atrocities of the Clinton's, Bush's, Obama's, Trump's, & especially Biden's...\n\nThey are ALL crooked & they are all controlled by higher evil powers. \n\nIt's not that bad being a crazy conspiracy person. \nI'm not taliki G about Bigfoot or Bases on Mars. \n\nI'm talking about an under wealthy  secret Cabal that wants to reduce the world population to below 1 billion people. They are paying the long game & Thwy are winning. \n\nAnyways, thanks for waking up! It's nice to have you with us!",

I apologize for any typos.\n\nAround November of 2020, my mom, brother, and me ended up catching Covid. My dad did catch it but it was very mild case. He was literally able to brush it off as a slight headache. It was kinda insane just because he technically was still recovering from health issues from the year before. \n\nFast forward to around Feb 2021, my dad got the vaccine without mentioning it to anyone. Caused a lot of drama with my mom who was/is very adamant against it. In a way, I know he got it to spite her but that\u2019s a whole other story\u2026\n\nAround March-April (sorry timeline is fuzzy) he ends up having a fainting spell which ends up sending him to the hospital. His heartbeat had become irregular and basically he had a mild stroke. He ends up getting a heart stent and then a stricter regiment of medications. Plus physical therapy.\n\nHe recovered for the most part. But his mind didn\u2019t.\n\nAfter that he just started making poor health decisions (not taking his meds for one) but after getting his booster, he regressed to an almost dementia like state.  Plus ended up having to have his heartbeat shocked as well as another stent. \n\nMost days he sits in a recliner in front of our front entryway. His limbs are completely filled with fluid because of retention. He has slurred speech patterns and can\u2019t remember a lot, including my name. He can\u2019t really do anything on his own and he refuses to take essential medications. Picks on my mom who is has become his caretaker essentially. \n\nLiterally dying. On borrowed time :/\n\nIt\u2019s insane because i\u2019m not saying it was purely the vaccines fault but my dad has, begrudgingly to me, has always seemed to have nine lives.  The man has recovered from some intense stuff.  I would never think that him getting the vaccine would land him in his current state, but that\u2019s what it seems like. One thing about him, prior to the stroke, he was always good about seeing a doctor and taking medications. He took them religiously actually. Which is why I assume he was in good health for a 70 y/o.\n\nSeeing him get like this, especially after getting the booster, it has made me really question what was in them. I\u2019m not against vaccines because i understand the science but i\u2019m scared of how greed corrupts the innocence behind that. I\u2019ve heard many cases of people having strokes/clotting. What\u2019s the deal????",

One of my best friend who\u2019s now paralyzed, she has the GBS. After her BuZTEr 5 hours after she could not move her body and has to go to the hospital. The thing about this friend situation is that she had her own company and no one force her to get it, on top of that she was one of those people who where extremely again the AnTI WaXErs in her weeding just few months before she got paralysis she demanded everyone who when to her weeding had to had the VACANTIONS. Now you may think she has woken up, but it does not look like it. She been posting on Facebook about her situation, but in neither of her post she does not mention nothing about the main cause. Also in the comments, no one has nothing to said about it. Only good wishes and nice things, but there\u2019s nothing about the VACATIONS.   So it looks like she did not learn her lesson or does not see how this thing she believe so much in has ruin her life. Some people just never learn",

Both my parents were fine from the boosters, thank God, but I'm so glad they aren't getting any more of them. I'm really glad they have the sense not to get any more of the shots after seeing the minor thing that happened to me. \n\nIt's devastating that big pharma and the world governments pushed these untested shots on so many people and killed many of them in the process. I'm very sorry your dad and your whole family has suffered so much because of that. I believe the whole \"Multiple shot\" approach was fucked from the start and I don't give a shit what any scientist, DoCtOr, or news puppet says. From what I saw, a lot of people got off lucky with the first 2 shots and the boosters are where things started getting really crazy. I stopped following it because no one in my family plans to get any more boosters, but I'm honestly terrified to see what happens once people start lining up for 4th, 5th, etc. I feel really stupid for taking the shot to begin with but I consider myself lucky for only getting the Dermatographia.",

What are the odds my healthy father coincidentally has a stroke 8 hours after receiving his booster? Pretty damn slim. \n\nSince then, he\u2019s been a wreck. He hasn\u2019t been able to work, his cognitive state is decaying, his memory is awful, he has no motivation to do anything.

But of course, whenever I mentioned it to any healthcare professional, I would get shrugged off as if I\u2019m some conspiracy theorist moron. Fuck Pfizer, fuck Moderna, and fuck all the corrupt assholes who are getting rich and living with no stress while the middle class citizens suffer. Fuck you!!!!\n\nTLDR: fuck the CDC/WHO for shoving this rushed vaccine down our throat and banning other alternatives like ivermectin. All about the Benjamin I guess"

Its literally one of the few viruses that is the cause of the *common cold.* Look it up. That, and rhinoviruses. Im not making this shit up. And a lot of people that caught covid never even had symptoms, due to...wait for it...immunity from previous coronavirus infections. In fact if you actually accounted for the all of the asymptomatic cases, the mortality rate would very likely be much lower, even lower than what it was, which was already low for some demographics.\n\n Once recently read a peer reviewed study that said those infected with SARS (a coronavirus) back in 2003 likely have *decades* of immunity, even to other variants, like covid-19. I was very sick in January of 2003. Had all of the symptoms of SARS. Did i have it? Maybe. But ill tell you this, ive been around numerous people shortly prior to their covid infection (when it is supposedly very contagious), shared close spaces with them as small as a car, ive been around people while they were sick with it. I havent had so much as a sniffle. Makes ya wonder.\n\nLong story short, covid was a bad cold virus. Did it cause deaths? Yes of course, sadly, just as the flu does, just as past coronaviruses have, especially in the elderly. However, before 2020, people would have looked at you sideways if you said a person with stage 4 renal disease died of the coronavirus (because they happened to have a cold infection at the time of their death). During covid-19 though, there was plenty of comorbid factor fuckery and misidentification of the true cause, or most likely cause of death. Instead it was regularly attributed to covid-19 if they had the infection at the time of their death, despite other serious health issues that may very well have been, ultimately, the cause of their death. \n\nBut calling it what it was, a particularly virulent cold virus, is apparently not ok because, god forbid, some may not have the same hyper sensitive, fear brimming-out-of-their eyes reaction to it. Ive seen it here on some other subs, get downvoted to hell for saying coronaviruses make up around 20% of common cold cases. Like I said, look it up. It has been stated in medical and microbiology literature.\n\nIt just shows the level of absurdity surrounding the entire thing, and how much people will turn a blind eye to some actual facts, to preserve a certain narrative that the government and media tell you to adhere to. An emotional response that is demanded of any \"compliant\" citizen...and that is frightening, and shows how much power certain supposed authoritative groups have over many people, even if it means deceiving and manipulating you for profit, to reduce your rights or perception of those rights, to instill in you a complacency with, certain \"backed\" wars and subsequent bloodshed, and to never question an \"official\" narrative that the news and government *command* you to believe.\n\nThis world needs help.",

I'm not one of them.  The truth is what matters to me.  When Comirnaty was granted approval, I looked into the EUA vs. Full approved version.  \n\nMy memory is a bit fuzzy as to the EXACT wording on the Pfizer website.  However it said something along the lines of \"effective\" formulary was the same, but were different products with no further explanation as to what made them different.\n\nMost assumed this to mean that the only difference was the label on the box.  In fairness, that COULD be accurate, but we have no way to know that.  Why would Pfizer say that they are the same, while also highlighting that they are not the same?",

Now that it's FDA approved, they say they'll only take units manufactured after the approval (even though the manufacturing process and ingredients didn't change).",

Obviously because of governments MSM and pharmaceutical companies power and money you will always have more articles positive about the jab. I am double vaxx (was forced to be in my country) but my problem is that I know IRL 4 young perfectly healthy people who had severe side effets with the jab. One went BLIND for hours after the booster . One had such hypotension that he had to stay in ICU for days ! One has fibromyalgia after the booster . And TWO had pericarditis after the jab. I know you can have all that with covid . But jab obviously doesn\u2019t prevent you from getting covid and very bad symptoms . Yes it might help some really old unhealthy people. But what is the point of getting a jab when you are young ? You can get bad side effects from the jab and still you can catch covid and have bad symptoms from it. At best it is partially useful for really old and sick people. That\u2019s it. I do love science . I am vaxx . But it doesn\u2019t stop me from being worried especially because all those people I know IRL who had bad bad side effects. I am on earth since 40 yo. Never ever knew someone with pericarditis or going blind after a vaccine before . So please be open minded if you really like science you should accept that we don\u2019t know everything yet.

I do see a lot of friends and family that are vaccinated and getting Covid often but I also see some that are vaccinated and don\u2019t catch it at all. I\u2019ve concluded a few things. \n1) People with kids or around kids catch a lot more illnesses in general than people who are not around kids as much. These people vaccinated or not get sick more often. \n2) People who are exposed to more germs in general don\u2019t seem to get as sick from Covid because their immune systems are primed. \n3) Those who live with excessive fear and stress tend to have worse side effects from Covid because stress lowers your immune system. Most people who are unvaccinated are not living in fear of the virus.\n4) I\u2019ve seen both people who are vaxxed and boosted not catch Covid and simultaneously vaxxed and boosted who catch Covid multiple times and frequently. I don\u2019t personally know of any unvaccinated people who have had Covid frequently (some stories of people catching the OG Covid and omicron but that\u2019s about it). \n5) This is a big one. People who are unvaccinated tend to look at alternative treatments that are not mainstream more than vaccinated people do. For example, vitamins and other repurposed drugs are used and likely have success in lessening the Covid symptoms (even as simple as using vitamin D). Vaccinated people tend to solely depend on the power of their vaccines. \n6) Everyone seems to experience Covid differently. \n7) My personal experience, my family and I (all unvaccinated at the time) caught Omicron and faired better than many of my vaxxed and boosted friends and family. We all took vitamins during and they did not. I had to take Novavax for work recently, so I may come back and report if I catch Covid again (as a comparison of whether I faired better unvaxxed or vaxxed).",

I know, I know pro vaxers tell us that the symptoms are less if we keep getting the boosters.

Within about 2 weeks later he tested positive again and was sick again needing a second round of treatment with the antiviral drug. \n\nSo, as far as I am concerned we are just part of a massive lab experiment ( study ) right now and so I am choosing to drop out of this study.",

That\u2019s fine, although you should have to deal with the decision. Currently science shows Covid can be really bad for some. So if you didn\u2019t get vaxed and end up being one of those that get it bad i feel my tax dollars shouldn\u2019t go to trying to save you from Covid. if I end up having a heart attack and die because of the vaccine i have no Ill will towards you, and you were right. One point I\u2019m trying to make is usually the simplest explanation is the right one. Which is the vaccine has side effects but they are not part of the \u201cplan\u201d. Although my main point was stating that if you claim that someone inflated the death rates to make Covid look worse than it was, how can you not think someone would do the same for the vaccine side effects.",

A major opponent of his at the time William Wagstaffe stated that variolation was likely \"nothing more than an artful means of depopulating a nation\" \n\nSide effects of Variolation were identical with those of smallpox (of course) and included infertility, brain damage, blindness, and permanent scarring.

These companies are as large as they are **because** of the government. The US pharma industry is one of the most heavily regulated in the whole world. Pfizer would be out on the streets begging for customers in a free market. Instead they are protected at every turn from competition by the federal government.\n\nPick any monopoly in history and behind it you'll find an overreaching government propping them up and giving them favorable control over the market. From MA Bell to modern telecoms, railroads, big oil, big pharma, big tech, mining, drilling, auto manufacturing, etc. The list is endless. Nothing about their monopolies are related to the free market. Free markets dissolve monopolies and governments create them.\n\nIf the government didn't have the power (given to them by the people electing big government politicians) then the companies would never get favorable treatment.\n\nYou can't blame the companies for what the government is doing and pretend it isn't the government. You're living in a fantasy land constructed by the billionaire owned media, the same media funded by big pharma, that is doing everything in their power to convince gullible people that the government needs more power and control over the markets. This is exactly what the billionaires want and the bootlickers on the political left gobble it up.",

So maybe 36-42 hours? I stayed up front with the kids. My mom talked to the coroner, but she was still in shock and was a hot mess coming out the back after talking to him. I'm not crystal clear on the details of their discussion because she was an emotional wreck for the following two weeks after and she gets emotionally furious anytime I try to talk about it with her. We are still packing up my sister's house which has been devastating my mom and the kids. To my knowledge though there wasn't anything special done for my sister, she is still in a plastic bag in a cardboard box, my mom hasn't come to terms enough to shop for an actual urn yet",

And it's gone up considerably, very quickly, for the longest time basic cremation, without viewing, was pretty standard around $800.. now, well depending on where you live, it usually starts, and quickly exceeds $1500+\n\n\nMy home is located in a fairly large city, and we predominantly work with unclaimed, unwanted and the.. unrich, so I get to see every type of elements. And we do not discriminate. Our standard, bare bones, straight to the fire, is approx. $1000-1200. Now that includes filing all the paperwork, (ordering extra death certificates, which does cost money but not much, etc),  removal and storing of the body, and the processing of the cremains. Now a lot of our clients qualify for state assistance which basically covers most of the cost. \n\nMy questions for you are, were you told about you possibly qualifying for state assistance, to help cover some of the costs?  I will not assume your financial situation, but we always discuss this as an option, regardless of whether they believe they would qualify or not, and sometimes they do when they never thought they would. So we basically always check if we think there is a fraction they might. \nWere you able to have a viewing, this typically is just like a funeral wake, but instead of a casket, there is an urn. Also, did you purchase an urn? If you chose to have your sisters remains returned to you in an urn, these can be pretty expensive. When you do a standard cremation, without an urn ordered, you would receive usually a temporary plastic container with a bag holding the cremains. Some opt to order their own specific urn and we will gladly accept that and transfer for you without charge, so the family doesn't have to. Also, sometimes we have family's chose the embalming to cremation package, which same as a wake, but instead of gravesite burial after, we take the body to be cremated, the embalming process adds a substantial amount of cost, so if you had any of these it could all pad the cost, but if what you had was a very quick death, to cremation, I would have questions. \n\nAlso, what were the amount of days between death and cremation? Because while yes, there is a RUSH standard that happens on occasion, you legally can not even cremate within 48 hours of death, a fully completed final disposition is required, and most importantly a Permit! And it all takes time. So timeline is important here also. And depending on which state, the body must be viewed by a ME from the county in which the person died, (if your sister was recovered from a Medical Examiners office, this was already done). All of these things need to happen before one is cremated, so as you might guess, it can be a process. Sometimes, very very rarely, all aligns just perfect and the body goes quite quickly, but your sister's situation seems very unusual?.. not to sound all conspiracy. I hope this helps a little and wasn't to ranty",

I've had 2 x AZ and a Moderna - don't feel any different to before.\n\nEdit to add I've never done the extra hand washing or sanitizer. Hate sanitizer as it makes my skin flaky!",

Just so happens the last few pandemics are all related as an illness that would cause things like cytokine storms throughout the body causing damage to all organs or certain organs in particular. It weaponizes our immune system response against us. Notice a lot of that shit going on lately, and nothing about it seems organic to stumble upon.\n\nThese Cytokine storms are prevalent and hard to trace since, if you have a comorbidity, it's likely your body is creating an immune response for that, and so you're making these lovely proteins, which don't fold right by the way, from taking the vaccine. Thing is, your macrophages don't know it's waste, and ignores it doesn't get rid of it. Gee. What would some useless heap of \"immune response\" do over time if you kept making it over react, via cytokine storm, and then just clumped these useless wrongly folding proteins all in one area. Gee that'd be a clot no? Or an organ being damaged. Or hey! maybe we can breech the brain blood barrier and get these nicely wrongly folded proteins everywhere, kinda like... idk a prion disease... like Mad cow disease.",

The shots are a depopulation effort *and* a means to institute further totalitarian control over those that remain.\n\nSo yes.  It *is* in fact a depopulation tool.\n\nBut it\u2019s more than that still.\n\n> If they full out said only people 60+ need to be vaccinated, it would make more sense because from a farming perspective, the old cows consume more (food, veterinary care, etc.) but don\u2019t produce enough milk anymore to offset the cost, AND there happen to be a lot of those 60+ cows because you had a \u201ccow boom\u201d 60 years ago.\n\nNot bad points, but the \u201cfarmer/cow\u201d analogy applies only so far.  Humans might be said to be a bit more complicated a species than bovines (only *might*, however.  I\u2019m actually not completely sure).  If they (we) *are* more complicated and intelligent than cows, then it would stand to reason that the means to use to depopulate the human herd would have to be a bit more complicated and not as simplistic as just shoving all the old cow-humans into the meat grinder of an overt depopulation effort using an injection that the other members of the herd would be easily able to see is a means to kill them.  That would potentially cause a global stampede/revolt that would be not-too-easy to keep down.\n\nSo tptb-farmers gotta use deeper psyops on the human cows.\n\n> The baby cows are your future milk-makers, and the young adults are your current milk-makers.\n\nWhat tptb are doing to the young right now is totally in line with an m.o. that says \u201cKill a good portion of them and enslave/control the rest that remain.\u201d\n\nThere will still be enough livestock left over to allow tptb to keep making money off the masses even after killing a good portion of the young and old alike.\n\n> If the goal was mass depopulation, they would just poison the water supply. So there must be a target.\n\nThe goal *isn\u2019t* just mass depopulation.  The goal is \u201ctrimming the hedges of that unruly bush called humanity and making sure the rest of the foliage stays controlled.\u201d\n\n> I keep thinking maybe it\u2019s NOT the vaccines killing people off\n\nIt is - at least in part.  The injections are definitely not the *only* thing - but they are no small part of the equation for sure.\n\n> So, there\u2019s definitely something up with the vaccines.\n\nYes, sir.  Definite manipulative fuckery has been afoot for a while now (if not for the entirety of human existence on this planet).",

Not knowing someone spit in your burger will cause you to continue being completely oblivious to all your future burger-eating endeavors, while actually knowing someone spit in your burger after you ate it will cause you to be a LOOOOOT more discerning in the future about where you eat, who you give your patronage to, what conditions the place you\u2019re eating at is in, how you communicate with whoever's serving you, etc, etc., and all THAT will very likely prevent you from ever having to go through any type of experience like that again - which will signify a definite improvement in your life station for sure.\n\nAgain, knowing matters.

Which is not the case and is, literally, the exact opposite of how to approach something using the scientific method. \n\nUntil a month ago, I could have said the same thing you just did, except I got the vaccine. However, my mom is a nurse, has covid patients, and got exposed. I got it from her. I can't blame the vaccine one way or another. They say it only lasts 3-6 months, so is it my fault I got sick because I didn't take a third? Or, from the other hand, would I have even gotten covid if I was never vaccinated? \n\nWell, we can't say for sure. We can sit here and guessimate until we are blue in the face, but right now no one on either side is right about everything. At the end of the day, it's just a whataboutism that isn't concrete in any definition of the word. \n\nAt the end of the day, let people make their choices and live with them. If I die in 3 years because I got a vaccine, that's on me. I can deal with that being my responsibility and my problem. Do I think the vaccine situation is fishy? Absolutely, I have from the start, but my dad is 80 years old and I try to be around him as much as possible. So I made the decision that if i have to shorten my life to avoid going 2+ years without being able to see my elderly father, that's worth it in my book. Does that mean everyone has to have the same conclusion and perspective as me? Again, of course not.",

One gets less than 2 tablespoons of vaccine for each shot.  The mrna has about 500 genes, which is about as much code as 4 integers on a computer.\n\nMrna gets into a persons cells and those cells produce covid spike proteins.  Our bodies immune system notices those proteins and creates memory t cells for when we encounter the real virus.\n\nThe stage 3 clinical trial of both mrna vaccines had about 30,000 participants.  The trials were conducted by third parties.  Other governments conducted their own independent studies.  They found high safety and efficacy at p<0.00002.  p is how much they trust the study.  Peer reviewed journals often publish other studies at p<0.05.   \n\nStanford examined the Moderna vaccine without Moderna's permission and didn't find anything fishy with it.

For about 2 years we wore masks everywhere we went. For 2 years with 3 kids under 10 and not even a sniffle. That's insane! Under normal circumstances kids get sick all the time because their immune system is in training. \n\nMarch 2022. My younger twins bring home Covid from preschool because it's hard to keep 4 year olds wearing masks all day. We were out of commission for about a week. But my wife and I decided to \"go back to normal\". Since we were both triple jabbed and our oldest was also vaccinated. Now that we'd had Covid on top of that we felt that our immunity was about as good as it could get. Plus watching Covid literally bounce off my 4 year olds (despite them not being vaccinated) did wonders for our fear level. \n\nSo we stopped wearing masks, as the mandates were lifting in my area around that time. Kids went back into sports, we started going to birthday parties and BBQ's again. Now we're paying for the 2 years of not breathing in people's germs. \n\nOur immunity is down for just about everything. My kids have been bringing home viruses on a weekly basis. We've had all manner of colds, pretty sure a couple different strains fo the Flu and even a couple bouts of Norovirus ran through our house in the last 4 months. Kids have been constantly sick.\n\nMy wife and I are getting through it ok. Because we're adults and our immunity is at a higher level because we'e older. Under normal circumstances I'll get sick maybe once a year with a sinus infection or 2 sprinkled in. This year (since I had covid) I've been significantly ill 3 times with sicknesses that weren't Covid. That's not normal. But it's not because of the vaccine, it's because I wore a mask in public and isolated myself somewhat during the 2 years of Covid.\n\nIt ain't rocket science. Most people who got jabbed probably also wore masks and tried to isolate for 2 years. We all dropped the masks and went back to normal so other viruses are having a field day with our lower immunity. My guess is it'll be a rough winter with respiratory illnesses like the Flu. But next season our immunity will all be back to normal and people won't be getting sick as much. I'll be making sure to get my Covid booster and Flu shot before the colder months this year for sure.",

The resulting recurrence of infectious episodes leads to hyperactivation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that are directed at a universal (i.e., MHC-unrestricted) T cell epitope comprised within the SC-2 spike (S) protein. As these cytotoxic CD8+ T cells enable prompt abrogation of productive infection and as this epitope is shared amongst some other glycosylated viruses causing acute self-limiting infection or disease, more and more cases of asymptomatic infections are to be expected in vaccinees, especially in those endowed with a mature and fully functional innate immune system.",
