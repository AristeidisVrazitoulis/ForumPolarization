They're paid shills trying to hold back the flood gates. If you want to rely on what the masses are saying, go right ahead.\n\n\nThere are plenty of prevention techniques (I wonder why \ud83e\udd14) that can be applied across the whole economy, though they may still allow individual institutions to fail. \n\nDeposit insurance systems insure each depositor up to a certain amount, so that depositors' savings are protected even if the bank fails. This removes the incentive to withdraw one's deposits simply because others are withdrawing theirs.[1] However, depositors may still be motivated by fears they may lack immediate access to deposits during a bank reorganization.[7] To avoid such fears triggering a run, the U.S. FDIC keeps its takeover operations secret, and re-opens branches under new ownership on the next business day.[23] Government deposit insurance programs can be ineffective if the government itself is perceived to be running short of cash.[22]\n\nBank capital requirements reduces the possibility that a bank becomes insolvent. The Basel III agreement strengthens bank capital requirements and introduces new regulatory requirements on bank liquidity and bank leverage.[citation needed]\n\nFull-reserve banking is the hypothetical case where the reserve ratio is set to 100%, and funds deposited are not lent out by the bank as long as the depositor retains the legal right to withdraw the funds on demand. Under this approach, banks would be forced to match maturities of loans and deposits, thus greatly reducing the risk of bank runs.[24][25]\n\nA less severe alternative to full-reserve banking is a reserve ratio requirement, which limits the proportion of deposits which a bank can lend out, making it less likely for a bank run to start, as more reserves will be available to satisfy the demands of depositors.[6] This practice sets a limit on the fraction in fractional-reserve banking.\n\nTransparency may help prevent crises spreading through the banking system. In the context of the recent crisis, the extreme complexity of certain types of assets made it difficult for market participants to assess which financial institutions would survive, which amplified the crisis by making most institutions very reluctant to lend to one another.[citation needed]\n\n**Central banks act as a lender of last resort. To prevent a bank run, the central bank guarantees that it will make short-term loans to banks, to ensure that, if they remain economically viable, they will always have enough liquidity to honor their deposits.[1] Walter Bagehot's book Lombard Street provides influential early analysis of the role of the lender of last resort.**\n\nThe role of the lender of last resort, and the existence of deposit insurance, both create moral hazard, since they reduce banks' incentive to avoid making risky loans. They are nonetheless standard practice, as the benefits of collective prevention are commonly believed to outweigh the costs of excessive risk-taking.[26]\n\nTechniques to deal with a banking panic when prevention have failed: \n\nDeclaring an emergency bank holiday\n\nGovernment or central bank announcements of increased lines of credit, loans, or bailouts for vulnerable banks",

This removes the incentive to withdraw one's deposits simply because others are withdrawing theirs.[1] However, depositors may still be motivated by fears they may lack immediate access to deposits during a bank reorganization.[7] To avoid such fears triggering a run, the U.S. FDIC keeps its takeover operations secret, and re-opens branches under new ownership on the next business day.[23] Government deposit insurance programs can be ineffective if the government itself is perceived to be running short of cash.[22]\n\nBank capital requirements reduces the possibility that a bank becomes insolvent. The Basel III agreement strengthens bank capital requirements and introduces new regulatory requirements on bank liquidity and bank leverage.[citation needed]\n\nFull-reserve banking is the hypothetical case where the reserve ratio is set to 100%, and funds deposited are not lent out by the bank as long as the depositor retains the legal right to withdraw the funds on demand. Under this approach, banks would be forced to match maturities of loans and deposits, thus greatly reducing the risk of bank runs.[24][25]\n\nA less severe alternative to full-reserve banking is a reserve ratio requirement, which limits the proportion of deposits which a bank can lend out, making it less likely for a bank run to start, as more reserves will be available to satisfy the demands of depositors.[6] This practice sets a limit on the fraction in fractional-reserve banking.\n\nTransparency may help prevent crises spreading through the banking system. In the context of the recent crisis, the extreme complexity of certain types of assets made it difficult for market participants to assess which financial institutions would survive, which amplified the crisis by making most institutions very reluctant to lend to one another.[citation needed]\n\nCentral banks act as a lender of last resort. To prevent a bank run, the central bank guarantees that it will make short-term loans to banks, to ensure that, if they remain economically viable, they will always have enough liquidity to honor their deposits.[1] Walter Bagehot's book Lombard Street provides influential early analysis of the role of the lender of last resort.\n\nThe role of the lender of last resort, and the existence of deposit insurance, both create moral hazard, since they reduce banks' incentive to avoid making risky loans. They are nonetheless standard practice, as the benefits of collective prevention are commonly believed to outweigh the costs of excessive risk-taking.[26]\n\nTechniques to deal with a banking panic when prevention have failed: \n\nDeclaring an emergency bank holiday\n\nGovernment or central bank announcements of increased lines of credit, loans, or bailouts for vulnerable banks",

It would be like me betting 50 bucks on a round of golf. Hardly something to make him retire over. \n\nI just dont see the evidence to support this claim. Its not as if players could play poker or gamble in that way.

It\u2019s a byproduct of the fact that subatomic particles don\u2019t really behave like single particles, but like waves constantly flitting between different energy states. This means even the seemingly empty vacuum of space is actually a roiling sea of virtual particles fluctuating in and out of existence, and all those fluctuations require energy.\n\nIf there\u2019s as much energy in those fluctuations as some \u2014 though definitely not all \u2014 physicists believe, and if we could ever learn how to tap into this phenomenon, we would gain access to an unparalleled source of energy. Zero-point energy could power the planet with the strength of multiple suns, making it easy for us to solve Earth\u2019s energy problems forever or to travel beyond the solar system and take our place among the stars.",

The whole world is schizophrenic, by the way, perceiving enemies where there are none, filled with projections of oneself to the brim. And just because you don't see them doesn't mean they aren't there. You yourself are the worst conjurer, for you can distill yourself from bravery or paralyze yourself with doubt. Ideas are spirits that can possess you. They can possess groups too. They are common in mobs and culture at home, work, and anywhere people congregate. These egregores, or archetypes, seize people and force them to act as their summoned spirits on a collective level, like a parasite and its host. Say, how do you act in war? Would you act docile and afraid? Of course not. You shape your soul, or behavior, to summon a spirit, and so forth. \" Aries, I besieged you. Mantle me with rage, so I could take their lands and women as slaves. \" And now you cease being you. You surrendered your original behavior to conduct in a way that is beneficial for war, and now you act like an animal, destroying whatever is in front of you like a good little soldier. The idea/spirit/archetype grabbed you and wouldn't let go; its benefits, its gold, were too good, so you didn't let go of the fruit. Take Walter White in Breaking Bad, for example. His way of being had changed drastically, and it was just too good for him; it got him what he wanted, and so he got possessed.

Obscure but great classic rock songs that he requested. We were having a good time. Then he switched gears and he started whispering to himself like he was being scolded by someone. He looked guilty or something.\n\n\nI said \"who ya talking with uncle?\" And I got the most evil response. Acrid voice. It called itself Mother. Told me to leave him alone. Referred to him by his name. Then he/it started trashing the place. Couldn't calm him down, so made him leave. This was ten years ago. Last time we've met.\n\n\nHe joined the US Army at 18. Wasn't good at school but I've been told he was pretty normal and a sweet kid. Less than a year later he was discharged. Never saw any action. But he came back schizo. My grandmother always thought they experimented on him or something along those lines.\n\n\nAfter almost 20 years away, I've recently moved back to my hometown. Yesterday I saw him walking down a sidewalk swinging around a b\u014d staff like a ninja turtle. Lol interesting dude. I would've stopped if I had had the time in the moment.",

South America is a topic that\u2019s rarely discussed in these circles.

US Marshall documents released by FOIA contradict the account of the ranch owner.\n\nBy the ranch owners account Scalia had a map of the ranch on his dining room table. Why? Perhaps it had something to do with the massive pipeline that was being built through his land? \n\nOdd coincidence that the company\u2019s stock value nearly doubled in the week following the incident. Look up $ET the month of February 2016. Perhaps unrelated. \n\nIt\u2019s already accepted that he was surrounded by the powerful and elite from other countries. Why was zero effort put into the investigation? US Marshall\u2019s requested the FBI investigate and Comeys FBI \u201cdeclined to investigate\u201d for some reason.\n\nThe massive influx of bot driven posts using cigars, alcohol, and obesity to cast a shadow of certainty over the cause of death. \n\nGarland was at the White House that night as well. Not to mention his connection to the Pritzkers and you have yourself an odd series of coincidences at best.",

Nuclear transmutation is already a thing, and is pretty much the basis of how nuclear reactors generate heat. Are you telling me that not one government agency like DARPA has silently been conducting research on applications for nuclear transmutation outside of heat generation? Seems highly unlikely, especially with all of the other crazy things DARPA has been researching. \n\nAlso, I've happened to stumble upon the works of Walter Russell, who I've been researching for many years. There is a PDF of archived NORAD files and documents which shows his communications with NORAD scientists with regards to an elemental transmutator he claimed to have built. He describes it in many of his own books and writings. Hell there are a few YouTube videos about it. \n\nThe topic of Russells books and inventions itself is a massive rabbit hole to go down into, but I have many of his original documents and books. Anyone who is interested can DM me. Maybe I will even make a post about it here in this subreddit.",

Soon, the representatives look like puppets within the culture and control of the group that exists by nature of an administrative heiarchy and it\u2019s trends. This confuses people, in them saying things like \u201cthey\u2019re puppets\u201d. \n\nWhat they\u2019re witnessing is called the \u2018deep-state\u2019. \n\nWithin a deep-state that has such powers and responsibilities like intelligence and defense, there emerges privileges to action and information that long-established members of an organization possess, that elected and temporary members don\u2019t, and this becomes the \u2018shadow government\u2019. \n\nTogether, it seems from an outsiders perspective, that there\u2019s some hidden hand moving things along, when in reality it\u2019s not very hidden and it\u2019s totally expected, because the government has decades of functioning plans and goals that transcend the whims of a mostly ignorant and distracted/disconnected populace.\n\nThis is all republics at their heart. That beyond the making, justification, and execution of legal writ, there\u2019s an organization of people keeping the rest of the machine running as cogs themselves.

A few cans here and there, like a couple rum and cokes on the weekend is not going to hurt you, a relatively healthy individual. But a sugar addict will buy and drink cases of the stuff every week.",

You can clean your teeth with it, put it on skin problems, use it as a carrier oil for harsher oils like tea tree oil, make soap with it, it's antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiviral, can be used on hair to get rid of lice, etc. and probably more. \n\nI eat it plain by the tablespoon and sometimes cook with it and it never gives digestive problems unlike olive oil, and it will never make me fat no matter how much I eat. Try it for yourself. Coconut oil is a true superfood, unlike other marketing gimmicks that use that word.",

Whatever it can use to keep your consious awareness at a low point.\n\nNobody is in charge of your conciosuness but you. \"They\" know this which is why they keep everyone so distracted and hooked on materialism. Materialsim fuels the physical which keeps you grounded to a lower state of consiousness. Making you thunk that your consiousness is the body grounds you in the physical. \n\nThere truly is nothing to fear here. Just don't watch the TV. It's all fake. Don't listen to the media. All fake.

In the presidential election of 1928, President Herbert Hoover was elected and was apart of the Republican party. Previously, the Republican party were progressives, moving forward and pushing towards equality. For example, President Abraham Lincoln and President Theodore Roosevelts were some of the best and most progressive presidents the United States has had. Anyway, President Herbert Hoover won the election of 1928. At the time, segregation was very popular. The majority of black voters voted for Herbert Hoover not because they agreed with him, but because they were scared of the democratic party, which at the time was represented by Al Smith. A year after election, Herbert Hoover was inaugurated. After his term ended in 1932, he was blamed for things such as the Great Depression, being a liar, and not representing the Republican party. In the 1932 election, Franklin D. Roosevelt won the vote by a majority, the first democratic president in 80 years to win by majority. This election consisted of the at-the-time conservative democrats, progressive republicans who thought Herbert Hoover wasn\u2019t right, and segregated black voters who distrusted him. As President Franklin D. Roosevelt helped the nation through the Great Depression, he offered a more socialistic approach, providing social work and more worker\u2019s rights. This clashed with the ideas of the conservative democrats, but aligned with the progressive republicans. This then caused the parties to flip and to this day, democrats are the progressive, more left leaning party while republicans are the more conservative, right leaning party.\n\nTLDR; The parties flipped because in 1932, Republicans voted Franklin D. Roosevelt because he promised a more progressive and socialistic approach to the Great Depression. The democrats didn\u2019t enjoy this and voted for the Republican Party, which caused the change. So yes, the THEN democrats created the KKK, but if they were put in today\u2019s age, they\u2019d be republicans. That is why the KKK aligns with the Republican party.",
