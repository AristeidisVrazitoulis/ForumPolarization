You're right, that was an assholeish thing to say, I have no excuses, but pretending that getting the Covid shot was a free and open choice for anyone is a very disingenuous and  harmful attempt to rewrite history.\n\nAt least where I live, there were enormous social, psychological, political and economic pressures coming in from all directions in an effort to force people to submit to the experimental medical procedure (drugs and vaccines are considered experimental for at least 6 years after the first human trials).\n\nHell, every digital street sign on every highway was retasked to perpetually brodcast messages like \"Stay safe, get vaccinated\" or \"protect your loved ones, get the covid vaccine\". And that's not even the tip of the iceberg, taking away peoples' livelihood en mass, lest they submit to experimental medicine, is tantamount violent coercion; and it is in fact far worse than beating people, or public whippings.\n\nEvery public employee in my country was forced to submit to the shot or lose their job, no medical or religious exemptions. That's a million people in a country of 36million, to say nothing of the private sector.\n\nWant to go to school, sorry you need the covid shot, want to keep your kids from freezing and starving, sorry you need the covid shot, want to have a relationship with your extended family, you know the rest.\n\nSubmitting to the covid shot was about as free a choice as someone putting a gun to your head, and asking you to make the free choice between money and your life.",

You're more likely to be young and die of a heart attack than to choke to death at any age (1.5 per 100,000 population).\n\nSharing these odds serves only to give perspective: that young people die of cardiac events at a higher rate than might be expected. I used the royal flush (literally any good poker hand has the same odds of being drawn as any other combination of cards being drawn) because more people probably have witnessed a good poker hand without knowing a young person who has died from a heart attack despite the latter being much more common in actuality. \n\nYour question then becomes paramount because it is the only way to draw a reasonable conclusion about how these vaccines have affected the incidence of cardiac events in young people.",

That perceived premise of theirs isn\u2019t illogical per se, but there\u2019s a fair amount of assumption baked into the thesis that I have never heard anyone question or challenge. The arguments as to why fewer people would be easier to control are almost so intuitive that people seem to have a mental block that doesn\u2019t allow them to brainstorm the off-chance that fewer people could actually be harder to control, under certain circumstances. The right circumstances for that scenario might have an awful slim chance of occurrence\u2014but it is a non-zero chance. And \u270c\ufe0f\u201dthe elite\u201d\u270c\ufe0fare definitely cavalier enough to be blindsided by their unchallenged assumptions.

It's possible we can uncover some ideas about what goes on. \n\nFor example, there could be some middle ground being considered which makes targeted depopulation look like general depopulation. What if there is an equation let's say.. quality and quantity of goods produced will be negatively impacted by X amount depending on how much general population is culled. So at some point along the decline of living citizens, there is an equilibrium where an acceptable amount of impact on goods. Or services or whatever the labor pool does to create the value of money.. \n\nThen suddenly general depopulation is okay up to that X% mark. \n\nSo the question we have to ask now is how to overlay these mathematical ideas upon real events to create a patterned look at money, power and goods obtained. Then you create a paper trail to the players and boom. You've your yourself a good old fashioned general depopulation conspiracy theory.\n\nI would still need to see more than my half baked theories to give this any appreciation.\n\nInflation is a decent counter point to the whole idea that they care about the value of money at all based on goods.

Every other vaccine had been developed after the diseases became endemic. Typically viruses are easy to quarantine and treat to buy time to create a vaccine. \n\n2. Most modern vaccines were developed in the 20th century. The rapid advancements in computational immunology over the last 20 years have increased the efficiency in analyzing and sequencing data.\n\n3. COVID is one of the fastest spreading viruses in almost a century. It can't be contained and its novelty made treatment costly and burdensome for millions of people. The cheapest and most practical solution was a vaccine, which is indeed rarely ever the case, but a once-in-a-century pandemic definitely fits the definition of rare. \n\n>I don't think that a disease that has killed less than 500 people under the age of 5 should require toddlers to be vaccinated.\n\nThat's a fine opinion to have, but it's not exactly like anyone is forcing toddlers to get vaccinated. The chances of them dying are low, but honestly, 500 dead toddlers dying unnecessarily isn't something I'd be okay with. That's why health providers just recommend it, but if you want to take that risk for your child that's on you.  \n\n>If the vaccine had been deployed to nursing homes and other people who were at risk like diabetics and the obese then there would not have been so many questions. \n\nHealthcare workers and elderly all did get priority back in January 2021. I drove my grandmother to her appointment myself. \n\nIt would seem even more suspicious to deny the general public access to a vaccine that killed and hospitalized millions around the world. To answer the question, It's not like most governments are supporting vaccines because they care about you. It's because they are forced to deal with the repercussions of paying for people's medicare, stimulus packages, lockdowns are negatively impacting the economy but ignoring the virus is too overtly apathetic. Vaccine deployment means everyone gets back to work and buying shit so they can continue paying taxes. Just like severe hurricane warnings, it's more expensive to search for missing people than it is to just rebuild.",

The COVID vaccine was based on a formula for SARS. We already know what the long term effects would be because very little of the deployment of the vaccine is really all that unique. mRNA vaccines are actually much simpler compared to vaccines that use inactivated viruses because they can't pose the threat of accidentally spreading live versions of the virus they protect from. \n\nThe normal testing cycle of a vaccine is often dragged out largely due to bureaucracy, not efficacy. Truth is that most testing isn't actually concurrent. Five to six months is an insanely realistic timeframe to complete all three trials. \n\n>What your viewpoint argues is that a few doctors' testimonials on Good Morning America means that the science is settled.\n\nNever watched Good Morning America in my life. My viewpoint is based on the conclusions of the majority of experts in every reputable medical and biological academic and research institution in the world. Meanwhile, your argument seems to be mostly repeated by a handful of sports players, tabloid magazines, and evangelical pastors.

My age group has a very low mortality from Covid, like less than 4 in 1000.

It means you survived a psy-op with incredible pressure from the media, the government, friends, family, employers, etc to get a useless and dangerous injection. You've told the government you don't give a fuck what they try, you're not having it. You're not some obedient pussy who does what the telly and smartphone tells you to do. \n\nI don't think you can comprehend how principled and strong a person needs to be to get through the last 2 years without getting the vaccine or even just wearing a mask. We were made to think we were alone in not wanting the vaccine. To make us question our sanity at times. \n\nFor example, being the only person in a supermarket without a mask is not an easy thing to do. It's automatic to feel like you should just wear a mask, blend in and not make a scene. Humans are social creatures and don't want to risk being a loner and standing out from the crowd. That's why so many got injected. So you've got to forget all of that instinct and follow your principles, knowing that you're in the right. Feels pretty great being mask free after the initial 5 mins of being worried about social judgment.",

Imo there was a rush put on to development of a medication to help fight virus. It was found that the sars2 spike protein was key to how virus gained access into cells. This being the case the vaccines were developed to replicate these proteins to trigger an immune response but we later discovered the impact these spike proteins have on our system ( interferes with DNA proteins responsible for self repair resulting in inflammation within the cells leading to numerous issues we are seeing now pop up in fairly young healthy people).but here's the real conspiracy\n We identified the risk of the spike protein before vaccines went into trails but it was decided to mute that info as it would put the project back another 6 months at least. So to save time and money big pharma tries to mute these findings. Some governments were complacent in that they also knew but sided with big pharma as they received  alot of campaign funding from big pharma profits. So yes , big government is in bed with big pharma and both chose profits over the health of their own citizens. Again the data and timeline suggests the vaccines were not intentionally designed to cause harm but rather a poor choice was made in it's design and once that was realized it was ignored due to potential profit losses combined with political pressure.",

In general I explore the status of Science, it's health as a method, and the status of Scientism which is destroying science.\n\nThe vaccine is a multipronged assault. The issue your husband is dealing with is inflammation in the brain. The mRNA and therefore spike protein can surpass the blood brain barrier. Inflammation can occur in the heart as myocarditis but in the brain as Alzheimer's, among many others.\n\nYou cannot undo the damage caused. Hearts should become far far more expensive as waiting lists grow in the next few years. As is self evident theseus's ship only goes so far. You cannot replace the brain of course. Not in the present at least.\n\nWhat you can do is take the things others have recommended. I took the horse paste ivermectin based on my body weight. In addition I took zinc and quinine via tonic water. I was having terrible chest pain after visiting vaccinated friends and one of those seems to have cleared it up. I cant comment on it's real efficacy, but make sure to verify doses. Zinc in a multivitamin is fine and tonic water containing quinine is perfectly safe. Ivermectin is a bit trickier and you have to dose by body weight. You can hurt yourself with this stuff.\n\nThe people recommending these approaches are using good science. Real cellular biology using proper terms, methods, and definitions. Their science checks out. Funnily enough the science on the other side checks out too, but they are being misleading with their terms, conclusions, and goals.",

That's just common sense. \n\n>not taking too big of a leap here\n\nYes, you are. Cancer and heart disease are common. Your examples, which you repeated for some reason, could have been told in 2005 or 1985 and no one would think there was anything particularly unusual about them.",

Seems toe they aren't incompetent. They have just been planning this for years and now is when they decided to run the beta test for the future to see what would happen and how we would respond",

I guarantee over 75 percent of the population works for some sort of corporation or the government. It may be more tbh. Nobody is outside governments control because they and the corporations work together. The top 1 percent own more money than all of the middle class combined. It will only get worse in time as their slavery system gets worse and worse. The WEF works with Amazon and Bezos Zuckerberg Trudeau and tons of other corporations like BlackRock and more. So the biggest social media company in the world the large investment corporation. And the richest company in the world and one of the richest men. Looks a lot like they control almost everyone and everything to me. Of course we all have free will but they funnel us down certain paths to give us the illusion of choice but in reality they just want us as mindless drones marching down the path they put in place for us and then die. They get extremely upset when you stray too far from their path",

How do we go about it? ...some sort of compulsory birth regulation would be necessary to achieve such control. One plan - the addition of temporary sterilants to water supplies or staple food. Doses of the antidote would be carefully rationed by the government to produce the desired population size.\" -Paul Ehrlich (population control advocate, author of The Population Bomb).\n\n\"Childbearing should be a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license. ...All potential parents should be required to use contraceptive chemicals, the government issuing antidotes to citizens chosen for childbearing.\" - David Brower (first executive director of the Sierra Club; founder of Friends of the Earth; and founder of the Earth Island Institute).\n\n\"One American burdens the Earth much more than twenty Bangladeshis.... In order to stabilize world population, we must eliminate 350,000 people per day.\" - Jacques Cousteau, quoted in the UNESCO Courier of November 1991.\n\n[https://newswithviews.com/the-elite-hidden-goal-depopulation/](https://newswithviews.com/the-elite-hidden-goal-depopulation/)\n\nThey've told us what they want. They do want you dead because youre using up resources and also, too many people are hard to CONTROL.\n\n**Thats why depop is a thing in the first place. Ideally, IIRC, they want the world pop to be around 300-800 million people.**\n\nSecondly, you're once again thinking like a normal person and not an elite. This argument comes up again and again because benign followers dont think like evil leaders. You are a benign follower. You think why would an evil leader kill a benign faithful follower like me???  Well, they believe they are so powerful, so influential --- and have been for so long -- that your personal ideology doesnt matter to them. They get away will murder, literal murder, all the time of those who try to go against them. Seth Rich is an example. Jamal Khashogi. And other untold mass atrocities.\n\nThey believe we are beneath them to such a high degree that it doesnt matter if you need to be forced into their desires or you do it willfully. They believe no matter what... their agenda will be realized. So selection of docile followers vs disobedient agitators doesnt matter. Because they think with power, no one can escape their plans.\n\nOnly benign follower would try to lead by pre-selecting for agreeableness and passivity lol. \n\nBecause they think of you like the Nazis think of the jews.

This prospective cohort study enrolled students   \nfrom two schools aged 13\u201318 years who received the second dose of the   \nBNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Data including demographics, symptoms,   \nvital signs, ECG, echocardiography and cardiac enzymes were collected at  \n baseline, Day 3, Day 7, and Day 14 (optional) using case record   \nforms.We enrolled 314 participants; of these, 13 participants were lost   \nto follow up, leaving 301 participants for analysis. The most common   \ncardiovascular effects were tachycardia (7.64%), shortness of breath   \n(6.64%), palpitation (4.32%), chest pain (4.32%), and hypertension   \n(3.99%). Seven participants (2.33%) exhibited at least one elevated   \ncardiac biomarker or positive lab assessments. Cardiovascular effects   \nwere found in 29.24% of patients, ranging from tachycardia, palpitation,  \n and myopericarditis. Myopericarditis was confirmed in one patient after  \n vaccination. Two patients had suspected pericarditis and four patients   \nhad suspected subclinical myocarditis. Conclusion: Cardiovascular   \neffects in adolescents after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination included  \n tachycardia, palpitation, and myocarditis. The clinical presentation of  \n myopericarditis after vaccination was usually mild, with all cases   \nfully recovering within 14 days. Hence, adolescents receiving mRNA   \nvaccines should be monitored for side effects.\"  \n\n\nNote that there is not a control group. Note that the study has just over 300 participants (not enough to be indicative of the population) and even then within that very small group we are looking at numbers like 7%, 2%, 4%...not exactly huge numbers. The \"study\" does absolutely nothing to test if the effects were caused by vaccine (this is why you want a control group who did not take the vaccine)  \n\n\nSo you take 300 kids from Thailand and out of those 300 12 of them reported feeling chest pain (when?) and that's the study? I don't know what kind of STEM courses are available in Thailand but this is a study that even a middle schooler in Biology class could tell you is fucked from the start. I hope nobody spent too much money doing this.",

Not everyone is out to get us nobody gives a shit as long as we keep working in their system and MAKING THEM MONEY.\n\nAnd finally my theory: I believe big pharmaceutical companies have realized the profit they can get from governments if they keep selling them the vaccine. When a company gets such a massive boost in profits as the pharmaceutical companies got from the vaccine, they kinda need to keep those percentages up, so if they made a cure all vaccine, it would just make them a 1 time big bag, and they need consistent growth in profits. Cue planned obsolescence. Most vaccines don\u2019t need a follow up fucking jab every 1/2-1 year. This is bullshit. Follow the money not your illogical paranoia.",

They poured enormous resources into this operation and they've been preparing for years.\n\nI get it you got deceived by state and corporate propaganda into taking the vaxx and are inclined to defend it now but we must honor truth above all and stay as objective as possible.\n\nPS: Wow, if I needed more proof this sub is flooded by shills and \"disinformation agents\" I certainly got it with the down votes for stating verifiable facts.",

Someone wanted lots of people to die and take as many others out with them as possible.\n\nAlso, this didn't stem from any single government or entity. The Chinese were alone in releasing it, and I don't think individual governments made the calls on how it was handled either.\n\nThis pandemic resulted in lots of cash bring funneled upward.

I have a medical condition that requires a prescription that I simply cannot afford without insurance. I went online, found a bunch of decent jobs to apply foe, and did. Then, after I got a few offers I picked one. I had a new job lined up before I quit my old job. There was no period when I had no insurance. Chances are, if you're working a job with benefits, you have a skill that will allow you to find another job relatively easily. \n\nI understand, moving a family across the country isn't convenient. But let's be 100% honest here. Most people chose convenience over their so-called principles. \n\nThey also could have filed for medical or religious exemptions, and fought the fight in court. Like many people did.\n\nThey also could have got fake vaccine cards, like many people did.\n\nWhat I am sick of, is people allowing themselves to become victimized, and then expecting great sympathy. I am not exceptional. Anyone could have done what I did. They chose to become victims instead. \n\n>\"Jewish people didn't HAVE to get on the trains and go to concentration camps. They had a choice. They could have chosen to get shot instead.\" \n\nThey could have chosen to run, hide or fight, like many of them did choose. It wasn't like there weren't dozens and dozens of red flags and warnings before the Nazis started murdering them.\n\nI get it. The fact that they had a choice doesn't justify the actions of the Nazis. Nor does it justify the actions of our government and corporations.

I might know a thing or two about the U.S. military.  I retired after 22 years of service in 2013.  Even way way back in boot camp they explained the difference between legal and illegal orders and that it was our duty to not follow illegal ones.  The military that are being forced separated for not following illegal orders are heroes in my book.  They knew the risk for doing the right thing and took it anyway.

In 2019 we had technology that we discovered that is really effective at killing the original and various varients in 1 shot. This is due to a revolutionary technique where the stem of a virus cell is targeted rather than its spike. Covid being a respritory illness also follows a similiar path of infection as the flu does. Both are known for high mutation rates which means likely varients to pop up. Now instead of developing this we went with mrna. Why? Way easier to scale like how its easier to get concrete than carbon nano tubes. This being a cheaper and quick to production product. They went with that.  I'm sure you have noticed the booster campaign in full swing which is causing these companies to explode in sales. They were taught a lesson that just raising the prices was too dangerous for public image \"gentlemen responsible just created a crypto thing as well related to health of course\" and then went to find another way to increase sales without the public being as mad.",

Earth has always had cycles of warmth and cold long before modern man. \n\n\nI agree humans can effect the quality of things like air and water but in regards to causing the earth to warm up and melt the ice?  Humanity\u2019s effect on \u201cglobal warming\u201d/climate change is minimal. See court case of Mann vs Ball https://www.quora.com/Why-did-climatologist-Michael-E-Mann-lose-his-lawsuit-against-Tim-Ball\n\n\nIf you think critically it sure seems like the powers that be could use it as a form of profits and control. Which only further convinced me it\u2019s all nonsense. Heck look at lithium batteries! We are digging/polluting/ruining so much earth to get these batteries that the \u201cgreen\u201d energy isn\u2019t true green energy. It\u2019s causing more harm and ends up using more energy than our current standard! \n\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of the fossil fuel industry but I do believe it\u2019s necessary at the moment. \n\nI would love for some true forms of free energy  like that of what you hear the real Tesla (Nikolai) had discovered.

The payment included $1.3\u00a0billion in criminal penalties for felony violations of the\u00a0Federal Food, Cosmetic Act and $1.0\u00a0billion to settle allegations it had illegally promoted the drugs for uses that were not approved by the FDA leading to violations under the\u00a0False Claims Act as reimbursements were requested from Federal and State programs.

For example, in a cohort of oncology drug trials, industry funded 44% of trials, and 69% of authors declared conflicts of interest [1].

One investigation reported that the mean stock price of the companies funding 23 positive pivotal oncology trials increased by 14% after disclosure of the results [2]. Several dramatic cases of biased industry trials have been widely debated [3]. These often involved selective reporting of outcomes and gift/ghost authorship. Other cases involved companies attempting to intimidate authors of independent investigations [4].\n\n[springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-018-5333-3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-018-5333-3)\n___\n>RESULTS  \nThe overall rate of disclosure was 71.2% (245 of 344 payments).

Only three institutions required that financial interests be disclosed to research subjects. Fifty-seven percent of the institutions required disclosure if the investigator anticipated the possibility of a conflict of interest in the future.\n> \n> Only one institution had mandatory strategies for managing the initial disclosure of conflicts of interest. 43% of the institutions had policies that mentioned the possibility of disclosing details of the COI and its management to the funding agency or research sponsor. 59% of the institutions had policies that mentioned public disclosure as a possibility, but very few policies defined it, and none mentioned disclosure to the IRB or research subjects as a way of managing a conflict of interest.\n\n>CONCLUSIONS  \nThere is substantial variation among policies on conflicts of interest at medical schools and other research institutions.

People keeps repeating he would do a military coup to close the congress but we had 2 national holidays (September 7th) that it would be possible and he didn't do it. And the ex-president Lula is trying to become president again (after going out of jail). As he threw tons of commodities money into bankers (in 2008), I think there's a plan for him to win (even altering the votes' results). He think it was easy to rule but at that time commodities was in a HIGH moment (economically speaking, we won a lot by the USA crisis and we exported TONS shit of food).. Last but not least: Lula is the one who wants to control/regulate the media(in our case, the brazilian MSM).

Makes sense https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/09/with-deadlocked-vote-on-dark-money-disclose-act-fails-to-clear-senate/\nSeems like you haven't done ur research into this issue. It would then give corporations pressure to only fund certain people because the Democrats could use their influence in the media and big tech to affect sales of companies funding certain people the Democrats don't like. But go on....keep making this a party issue. Be a good little pawn. I've already said the Republicans have the same corruption in their party like the Democrats. U just don't want to admit the party u support has extreme issues as well. Like Nancy Pelosis insider trading. But you don't want to talk about that do you?",

Lmao I'm sure u spent a few hours trying to find that. I have already shown u research u just don't believe anything that goes against ur own viewpoint. I showed u an article saying ur wrong about Republicans who voted against that because that means the Democrats would have free reign to attack their donors politically thru the courts and media and more. Anonymity can be a good thing sometimes and I understand how u were twisted into believing there lies. I don't think the question to solve that issue is as easy as it seems. We have already seen Democrats persecuting people like Mike Lindell with the FBI. It would be more political persecution if they had the names of donors. And some people want it to be private anyways. It's ok for someone to be private about there political beliefs.",

Not like Pelosi makes millions insider trading every day. Your completely brainwashed dude to think the Democrats aren't as corrupt as Republicans. That's why you have to look at the individual instead of the party. But go on keep thinking Biden and the rest aren't corrupt. Live in ur delusional world.

If you blindly follow a party you end up voting for someone who is just a puppet. That's why I supported Bernie and now I'm supporting DeSantis. But go on keep thinking that the Democrat part isn't insanely corrupt with Hillary Biden Obama Pelosi and the rest. Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard are the only one keeping it even a little sane. They just won't put either of them in office because they won't follow their corrupt agendas. There are tons of Republicans that are corrupt.

Again if you have to wait for the media or government to tell you to put ur right shoe on the right foot ur already lost and helpless. You really think they are going to actually be truthful and report and look into all these deaths? As long as they can get away with it they don't have to do anything. They can just claim heart attacks happen all the time and there is no correlation like u said. But the stories are all the same. No health issues. No problems at all. And then just randomly a young person dies within days of taking it. And then some people die months later. Which is much harder to prove if the shot killed them.

These are lifted from a website because its been a few years since I went down that rabbit hole and I just don't remember them word for word. \n\nGenesis chapter 1 says the first man and woman were made at the same   \ntime, and after the animals. But Genesis chapter 2 gives a different   \norder of creation: man, then the animals, and then woman.\n\nGenesis chapter 1 lists six days of creation, whereas chapter 2 refers   \nto the \u201cday that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.\u201d Genesis   \n1:2-3 claims that God created light and divided it from darkness on the   \nfirst day; but Genesis 1:14-19 tells us the sun, moon, and stars weren\u2019t  \n made until the fourth day.\n\nContradictions are also seen in the biblical story of a worldwide flood.  \n According to Genesis 6:19-22, God ordered Noah to bring \u201cof every   \nliving thing of all flesh, two of every sort . . . into the ark.\u201d   \nNevertheless, Genesis 7:2-3 relates that the Lord ordered Noah to take   \ninto the ark the clean beasts and the birds by sevens, and only the   \nunclean beasts by twos.\n\nGenesis 8:4 reports that, as the waters of the flood receded, Noah\u2019s ark  \n rested on the mountains of Ararat in the seventh month. The very next   \nverse, however, says the mountaintops could not be seen until the tenth   \nmonth.\n\nGenesis 8:13 describes the earth as being dry on the first day of the   \nfirst month. But Genesis 8:14 informs us the earth was not dry until the  \n twenty-seventh day of the second month.\n\nThe Old Testament contains an interesting contradiction in the story of   \nthe census taken by King David and the resulting punishment of the   \nIsraelites. God was so angered by the census that he sent a plague that   \nkilled 70,000 men. According to II Samuel 24:1, the Lord had caused   \nDavid to take the census \u2013 which makes the punishment appear even more   \nnonsensical. But an attempt was later made, at I Chronicles 21:1, to   \nimprove God\u2019s image by claiming that Satan incited the census.\n\nFurther, the Old Testament is contradictory as to whether the Lord   \ncommanded the Israelites to sacrifice animals to him. At Jeremiah 7:22,   \nGod denies he ever gave the Israelites commandments about animal   \nsacrifices. In contrast, Exodus 29:38-42 and many other verses depict   \nGod as requiring the Israelites to offer animal sacrifices.\n\nIn the New Testament, there are contradictions between the genealogies   \nof Jesus given in the first chapter of Matthew and the third chapter of   \nLuke.\n\nBoth genealogies begin with Jesus\u2019 father, who is identified as Joseph   \n(which is curious, given that Mary was supposedly impregnated by the   \nHoly Ghost). But Matthew says Joseph\u2019s father was Jacob, while Luke   \nclaims he was Heli. Matthew lists 26 generations between Jesus and King   \nDavid, whereas Luke records 41. Matthew runs Jesus\u2019 line of descent   \nthrough David\u2019s son Solomon, while Luke has it going through David\u2019s son  \n Nathan.\n\nThe story of Jesus\u2019 birth is also contradictory. Matthew 2:13-15 depicts  \n Joseph and Mary as fleeing to Egypt with the baby Jesus immediately   \nafter the wise men from the east had brought gifts.\n\nBut Luke 2:22-40 claims that after the birth of Jesus, his parents   \nremained in Bethlehem for the time of Mary\u2019s purification (which was 40   \ndays, under the Mosaic law). Afterwards, they brought Jesus to Jerusalem  \n \u201cto present him to the Lord,\u201d and then returned to their home in   \nNazareth. Luke mentions no journey into Egypt or visit by wise men from   \nthe east.\n\nConcerning the death of Judas, the disloyal disciple, Matthew 27:5   \nstates he took the money he had received for betraying Jesus, threw it   \ndown in the temple, and \u201cwent and hanged himself.\u201d To the contrary, Acts  \n 1:18 claims Judas used the money to purchase a field and \u201cfalling   \nheadlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.\u201d\n\nIn describing Jesus being led to his execution, John 19:17 recounts that  \n he carried his own cross. But Mark 15:21-23 disagrees by saying a man   \ncalled Simon carried the cross.\n\nRegarding the last words of Jesus while on the cross, Matthew 27:46 and   \nMark 15:34 quote Jesus as crying with a loud voice, \u201cMy God, my God, why  \n hast thou forsaken me?\u201d Luke 23:46 gives his final words as, \u201cFather,   \ninto thy hands I commend my spirit.\u201d John 19:30 alleges the last words   \nwere, \u201cIt is finished.\u201d\n\nThere are even contradictions in the accounts of the resurrection \u2013 the   \nsupposed event that is the very foundation of the Christian religion.   \nMark 16:2 states that on the day of the resurrection, certain women   \narrived at the tomb at the rising of the sun. But John 20:1 informs us   \nthey arrived when it was yet dark. Luke 24:2 describes the tomb as open   \nwhen the women arrived, whereas Matthew 28:1-2 indicates it was closed.   \nMark 16:5 declares that the women saw a young man at the tomb, Luke 24:4  \n says they saw two men, Matthew 28:2 reports they saw an angel, and John  \n 20:11-12 claims they saw two angels.\n\nThe Bible has verses mentioning dragons (Jeremiah 51:34), unicorns   \n(Isaiah 34:7), and cockatrices (Isaiah 11:8). These passages led many   \nnaturalists in the Middle Ages to think such mythical creatures actually  \n exist.\\[46\\]\n\nFinally, it\u2019s inconsistent with science \u2013 and   \nludicrous \u2013 to believe that God confounded the language of humans   \nbecause he was afraid they would build a tower high enough to reach   \nheaven (Genesis 11:1-9).",

This is in healthy people too, so their immune system should be able to stop that from happening but it's not. So I think what I said about it bypassing it has a very high probability of being true. It just makes sense. Nothing else can explain this.",

We really don\u2019t know that (about the Sputnik vaccine),\u201d said Kathryn Edwards, a professor of paediatrics and vaccine expert in the infectious diseases division at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in the United States.\n\nShe said that the risk of what a vaccine might do to a virus - in terms of fighting it, blocking it, or forcing it to adapt - is \u201calways a concern\u201d.\n\nDan Barouch, a specialist at Harvard\u2019s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, noted that mutation rates for coronaviruses are far lower than for viruses like HIV, but added: \u201cThere are many potential downsides of using a vaccine that doesn\u2019t work. The risk that it (the virus) would mutate is a theoretical risk.\u201d\n\nScientists say similar evolutionary pressure to mutate is seen with bacterial pathogens, which - when faced with antibiotics designed to target them - can evolve and adapt to evade the drugs and develop resistance.\n\nAntibiotic resistance and the rise of superbugs, is described by the World Health Organization as one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development today.\n\nJones stressed that vaccine-induced viral mutations are \u201ca rare outcome\u201d, and the greater the efficacy of the vaccine in blocking a virus\u2019 ability to enter cells and replicate there, the lower the risk of it having an opportunity to circulate and \u201clearn\u201d how to evade antibody defences.\n\n\u201cIf (a vaccine) is completely sterilizing, the virus can\u2019t get in, so it can\u2019t learn anything because it never gets a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it gets in and replicates ... there is selection pressure for it to evade whatever antibodies have been generated by the inefficient vaccine. And you don\u2019t know what the outcome of that will be.\u201d\n\n\nBonus Nature.com article from March 2021.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00728-2\n\nHigher rates of immunity can create selective pressure, which would favour variants that are able to infect people who have been immunized.\n\nVaccines will almost inevitably create new evolutionary pressures that produce variants.",

Drugs do NOT always act in the way \"Science\" (read: big pharma) predicted based on theory, this is why long term studies are *required* for full FDA approval and why the FDA would not approve this \"vaccine\" for anything but emergency use. \n\nPlease go Google \"Thalidomide.\" I'll wait. \n\nMy body is not owned by the government of the United  States of America, or by \"Science\" (read: big pharma). No one, and when I say no one I absolutely mean NO ONE, has the right to tell me I have to put ANY DAMN THING into it... Especially not an *experimental drug* that has had no long term testing, does not have full FDA approval, and *isn't even effective at what it was created for* - not as a legal mandate, and not with the threat of job loss, homelessness, and starvation. *No one.* Fucking full stop. \n\n\"Science\" can go find its fucking money elsewhere. I was not born to fund \"scientific research\" by risking my health, my safety, my peace of mind, or my DNA for future generations. \n\nFuck \"Science\" (read: big pharma).

And are still being forced to be given the original, ignoring all recent data while dismissing all religious accommodations even though chaplains have signed off and approved religious exemption to be valid by lengthy interview processes.

Obviously because of governments MSM and pharmaceutical companies power and money you will always have more articles positive about the jab. I am double vaxx (was forced to be in my country) but my problem is that I know IRL 4 young perfectly healthy people who had severe side effets with the jab. One went BLIND for hours after the booster . One had such hypotension that he had to stay in ICU for days ! One has fibromyalgia after the booster . And TWO had pericarditis after the jab. I know you can have all that with covid . But jab obviously doesn\u2019t prevent you from getting covid and very bad symptoms . Yes it might help some really old unhealthy people. But what is the point of getting a jab when you are young ? You can get bad side effects from the jab and still you can catch covid and have bad symptoms from it. At best it is partially useful for really old and sick people. That\u2019s it. I do love science . I am vaxx . But it doesn\u2019t stop me from being worried especially because all those people I know IRL who had bad bad side effects. I am on earth since 40 yo. Never ever knew someone with pericarditis or going blind after a vaccine before . So please be open minded if you really like science you should accept that we don\u2019t know everything yet.

I do see a lot of friends and family that are vaccinated and getting Covid often but I also see some that are vaccinated and don\u2019t catch it at all. I\u2019ve concluded a few things. \n1) People with kids or around kids catch a lot more illnesses in general than people who are not around kids as much. These people vaccinated or not get sick more often. \n2) People who are exposed to more germs in general don\u2019t seem to get as sick from Covid because their immune systems are primed. \n3) Those who live with excessive fear and stress tend to have worse side effects from Covid because stress lowers your immune system. Most people who are unvaccinated are not living in fear of the virus.\n4) I\u2019ve seen both people who are vaxxed and boosted not catch Covid and simultaneously vaxxed and boosted who catch Covid multiple times and frequently. I don\u2019t personally know of any unvaccinated people who have had Covid frequently (some stories of people catching the OG Covid and omicron but that\u2019s about it). \n5) This is a big one. People who are unvaccinated tend to look at alternative treatments that are not mainstream more than vaccinated people do. For example, vitamins and other repurposed drugs are used and likely have success in lessening the Covid symptoms (even as simple as using vitamin D). Vaccinated people tend to solely depend on the power of their vaccines. \n6) Everyone seems to experience Covid differently. \n7) My personal experience, my family and I (all unvaccinated at the time) caught Omicron and faired better than many of my vaxxed and boosted friends and family. We all took vitamins during and they did not. I had to take Novavax for work recently, so I may come back and report if I catch Covid again (as a comparison of whether I faired better unvaxxed or vaxxed).",

She saw him and he had no answers for her. Since then she has gotten every booster. She's now been sick for 5 days after giving me covid on sunday. My symptoms kicked in last night. The extent of my symptoms are: mildly sore back, mildly sore eyes, and mild fatigue. I worked in my shop yesterday, took two walks and finally felt tired by the evening.

Whatever tissue is injected is the target.\n\nHeres a decent paper regarding the subject :. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2915550/#!po=12.6506\n\nSimilar study from the 40s (targeting mammalian brains). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2135907/\n\nSo what organ is being targeted?  The answer is all of them.  Because the spike protein they are provoking an immune response to is in reality a FURIN, AKA A SUBCELLULAR ORGAN WHICH IS PRESENT THROUGHOUT ALL TISSUES IN THE BODY ESPECIALLY THE NERVOUS AND REPRODUCTIVE TISSUES.  \n\nIn addition to this old school method of population control they are inserting graphene based nanotechnology in some shots   There are several different experiments being run simultaneously, some designed to kill some designed to be the beta test for wirelessly manipulating human nervous systems.",

Instead they are protected at every turn from competition by the federal government.\n\nPick any monopoly in history and behind it you'll find an overreaching government propping them up and giving them favorable control over the market. From MA Bell to modern telecoms, railroads, big oil, big pharma, big tech, mining, drilling, auto manufacturing, etc. The list is endless. Nothing about their monopolies are related to the free market. Free markets dissolve monopolies and governments create them.\n\nIf the government didn't have the power (given to them by the people electing big government politicians) then the companies would never get favorable treatment.\n\nYou can't blame the companies for what the government is doing and pretend it isn't the government. You're living in a fantasy land constructed by the billionaire owned media, the same media funded by big pharma, that is doing everything in their power to convince gullible people that the government needs more power and control over the markets. This is exactly what the billionaires want and the bootlickers on the political left gobble it up.",

So maybe 36-42 hours? I stayed up front with the kids. My mom talked to the coroner, but she was still in shock and was a hot mess coming out the back after talking to him. I'm not crystal clear on the details of their discussion because she was an emotional wreck for the following two weeks after and she gets emotionally furious anytime I try to talk about it with her. We are still packing up my sister's house which has been devastating my mom and the kids.

And it's gone up considerably, very quickly, for the longest time basic cremation, without viewing, was pretty standard around $800.. now, well depending on where you live, it usually starts, and quickly exceeds $1500+\n\n\nMy home is located in a fairly large city, and we predominantly work with unclaimed, unwanted and the.. unrich, so I get to see every type of elements. And we do not discriminate. Our standard, bare bones, straight to the fire, is approx. $1000-1200. Now that includes filing all the paperwork, (ordering extra death certificates, which does cost money but not much, etc),  removal and storing of the body, and the processing of the cremains. Now a lot of our clients qualify for state assistance which basically covers most of the cost. \n\nMy questions for you are, were you told about you possibly qualifying for state assistance, to help cover some of the costs?  I will not assume your financial situation, but we always discuss this as an option, regardless of whether they believe they would qualify or not, and sometimes they do when they never thought they would. So we basically always check if we think there is a fraction they might. \nWere you able to have a viewing, this typically is just like a funeral wake, but instead of a casket, there is an urn. Also, did you purchase an urn? If you chose to have your sisters remains returned to you in an urn, these can be pretty expensive. When you do a standard cremation, without an urn ordered, you would receive usually a temporary plastic container with a bag holding the cremains. Some opt to order their own specific urn and we will gladly accept that and transfer for you without charge, so the family doesn't have to. Also, sometimes we have family's chose the embalming to cremation package, which same as a wake, but instead of gravesite burial after, we take the body to be cremated, the embalming process adds a substantial amount of cost, so if you had any of these it could all pad the cost, but if what you had was a very quick death, to cremation, I would have questions. \n\nAlso, what were the amount of days between death and cremation? Because while yes, there is a RUSH standard that happens on occasion, you legally can not even cremate within 48 hours of death, a fully completed final disposition is required, and most importantly a Permit! And it all takes time. So timeline is important here also. And depending on which state, the body must be viewed by a ME from the county in which the person died, (if your sister was recovered from a Medical Examiners office, this was already done). All of these things need to happen before one is cremated, so as you might guess, it can be a process. Sometimes, very very rarely, all aligns just perfect and the body goes quite quickly, but your sister's situation seems very unusual?.. not to sound all conspiracy. I hope this helps a little and wasn't to ranty",

A spike protein that's been modified with 2 proline molecules so that it's more stable and harder for the body to break down. They are detecting vax spike in people 2 months out while the authorities baselessly claimed the spike only lasted 48 hrs and stayed in the muscle tissue.

What\u2019s odd about the terminology now is that there is little effort to parse out the data sets across the never vaccinated, partially-vaccinated, 2-dose vaxxed, and boosted. I think Walgreens data is one of the few sources of data on this, and they show that unvaccinated are just as protected (if not more) than the recently boosted.

It weaponizes our immune system response against us. Notice a lot of that shit going on lately, and nothing about it seems organic to stumble upon.\n\nThese Cytokine storms are prevalent and hard to trace since, if you have a comorbidity, it's likely your body is creating an immune response for that, and so you're making these lovely proteins, which don't fold right by the way, from taking the vaccine. Thing is, your macrophages don't know it's waste, and ignores it doesn't get rid of it. Gee. What would some useless heap of \"immune response\" do over time if you kept making it over react, via cytokine storm, and then just clumped these useless wrongly folding proteins all in one area. Gee that'd be a clot no? Or an organ being damaged. Or hey! maybe we can breech the brain blood barrier and get these nicely wrongly folded proteins everywhere, kinda like... idk a prion disease... like Mad cow disease.",

The shots are a depopulation effort *and* a means to institute further totalitarian control over those that remain.\n\nSo yes.  It *is* in fact a depopulation tool.\n\nBut it\u2019s more than that still.\n\n> If they full out said only people 60+ need to be vaccinated, it would make more sense because from a farming perspective, the old cows consume more (food, veterinary care, etc.) but don\u2019t produce enough milk anymore to offset the cost, AND there happen to be a lot of those 60+ cows because you had a \u201ccow boom\u201d 60 years ago.\n\nNot bad points, but the \u201cfarmer/cow\u201d analogy applies only so far.  Humans might be said to be a bit more complicated a species than bovines (only *might*, however.  I\u2019m actually not completely sure).  If they (we) *are* more complicated and intelligent than cows, then it would stand to reason that the means to use to depopulate the human herd would have to be a bit more complicated and not as simplistic as just shoving all the old cow-humans into the meat grinder of an overt depopulation effort using an injection that the other members of the herd would be easily able to see is a means to kill them.  That would potentially cause a global stampede/revolt that would be not-too-easy to keep down.\n\nSo tptb-farmers gotta use deeper psyops on the human cows.\n\n> The baby cows are your future milk-makers, and the young adults are your current milk-makers.\n\nWhat tptb are doing to the young right now is totally in line with an m.o. that says \u201cKill a good portion of them and enslave/control the rest that remain.\u201d\n\nThere will still be enough livestock left over to allow tptb to keep making money off the masses even after killing a good portion of the young and old alike.\n\n> If the goal was mass depopulation, they would just poison the water supply. So there must be a target.\n\nThe goal *isn\u2019t* just mass depopulation.  The goal is \u201ctrimming the hedges of that unruly bush called humanity and making sure the rest of the foliage stays controlled.\u201d\n\n> I keep thinking maybe it\u2019s NOT the vaccines killing people off\n\nIt is - at least in part.  The injections are definitely not the *only* thing - but they are no small part of the equation for sure.\n\n> So, there\u2019s definitely something up with the vaccines.\n\nYes, sir.  Definite manipulative fuckery has been afoot for a while now (if not for the entirety of human existence on this planet).",

Everyone was saying that cloth masks, sewn masks, crocheted masks with a pocket for a removable thing all were bad and created a false sense of security and should never ever be worn and then quite literally everyone changed their opinion overnight and you were a monster who wanted to kill the elderly if you went to a hiking trail by yourself without a mask. It was the oddest thing I ever witnessed.",

Which is not the case and is, literally, the exact opposite of how to approach something using the scientific method. \n\nUntil a month ago, I could have said the same thing you just did, except I got the vaccine. However, my mom is a nurse, has covid patients, and got exposed. I got it from her. I can't blame the vaccine one way or another. They say it only lasts 3-6 months, so is it my fault I got sick because I didn't take a third? Or, from the other hand, would I have even gotten covid if I was never vaccinated? \n\nWell, we can't say for sure. We can sit here and guessimate until we are blue in the face, but right now no one on either side is right about everything. At the end of the day, it's just a whataboutism that isn't concrete in any definition of the word. \n\nAt the end of the day, let people make their choices and live with them. If I die in 3 years because I got a vaccine, that's on me. I can deal with that being my responsibility and my problem. Do I think the vaccine situation is fishy? Absolutely, I have from the start, but my dad is 80 years old and I try to be around him as much as possible. So I made the decision that if i have to shorten my life to avoid going 2+ years without being able to see my elderly father, that's worth it in my book. Does that mean everyone has to have the same conclusion and perspective as me? Again, of course not.",

The mrna has about 500 genes, which is about as much code as 4 integers on a computer.\n\nMrna gets into a persons cells and those cells produce covid spike proteins.  Our bodies immune system notices those proteins and creates memory t cells for when we encounter the real virus.\n\nThe stage 3 clinical trial of both mrna vaccines had about 30,000 participants.  The trials were conducted by third parties.  Other governments conducted their own independent studies.  They found high safety and efficacy at p<0.00002.  p is how much they trust the study.  Peer reviewed journals often publish other studies at p<0.05.   \n\nStanford examined the Moderna vaccine without Moderna's permission and didn't find anything fishy with it.  Someone in South Africa did that too.  The skills and equipment they had aren't easy to acquire.  I am certain you don't have those.  \n\nThe easy answer is 'drink your own pee'.

I never lost my sense of taste or had any trouble breathing. Finally went to the walk in clinic because I kept waking up with cold sweats. Tested positive for covid, but the only medicine they gave me was for Bronchitis to clear my lungs up. This worked and I made a full recovery. They also told me to wear a mask around other people.\n\nMy roommate is double vaxxed, he was going to get the third jab but then his best friend almost died from blood clots from the Moderna vaccine.

For about 2 years we wore masks everywhere we went. For 2 years with 3 kids under 10 and not even a sniffle. That's insane! Under normal circumstances kids get sick all the time because their immune system is in training. \n\nMarch 2022. My younger twins bring home Covid from preschool because it's hard to keep 4 year olds wearing masks all day. We were out of commission for about a week. But my wife and I decided to \"go back to normal\". Since we were both triple jabbed and our oldest was also vaccinated. Now that we'd had Covid on top of that we felt that our immunity was about as good as it could get. Plus watching Covid literally bounce off my 4 year olds (despite them not being vaccinated) did wonders for our fear level. \n\nSo we stopped wearing masks, as the mandates were lifting in my area around that time. Kids went back into sports, we started going to birthday parties and BBQ's again. Now we're paying for the 2 years of not breathing in people's germs. \n\nOur immunity is down for just about everything. My kids have been bringing home viruses on a weekly basis. We've had all manner of colds, pretty sure a couple different strains fo the Flu and even a couple bouts of Norovirus ran through our house in the last 4 months. Kids have been constantly sick.\n\nMy wife and I are getting through it ok. Because we're adults and our immunity is at a higher level because we'e older. Under normal circumstances I'll get sick maybe once a year with a sinus infection or 2 sprinkled in. This year (since I had covid) I've been significantly ill 3 times with sicknesses that weren't Covid. That's not normal. But it's not because of the vaccine, it's because I wore a mask in public and isolated myself somewhat during the 2 years of Covid.\n\nIt ain't rocket science. Most people who got jabbed probably also wore masks and tried to isolate for 2 years. We all dropped the masks and went back to normal so other viruses are having a field day with our lower immunity. My guess is it'll be a rough winter with respiratory illnesses like the Flu. But next season our immunity will all be back to normal and people won't be getting sick as much. I'll be making sure to get my Covid booster and Flu shot before the colder months this year for sure.",

She was in her mid 30s and she died \"suddenly and unexpectedly\" leaving behind a 6 month old infant.\n\nI also know a lot of people who did not get any serious side effects, thankfully.\n\nThe really crazy part, they tried to force everyone take the vax where I work. There was only a few of us who held out and didn't take it. They told us we would lose our jobs. We didn't budge. When the deadline approached I filled out a religious exemption and it was accepted. Even though they tried to make it sound like they wouldn't. \n\nSo now when we have outbreaks at work, it is always someone who was vaccinated. 100% of the time. \n\nI had Covid early on and refused the jab. I have not had covid once in 2 years and that is with being tested 2x per week for week. All of the vaxed employees continue to test positive. \n\nI will never take that jab.",

The resulting recurrence of infectious episodes leads to hyperactivation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that are directed at a universal (i.e., MHC-unrestricted) T cell epitope comprised within the SC-2 spike (S) protein. As these cytotoxic CD8+ T cells enable prompt abrogation of productive infection and as this epitope is shared amongst some other glycosylated viruses causing acute self-limiting infection or disease, more and more cases of asymptomatic infections are to be expected in vaccinees, especially in those endowed with a mature and fully functional innate immune system.",

The vax has been out there a long time. It's not like they can't find access or didn't get around to it. The number have been fairly constant at this point so it's not having to wait 6 weeks or so before the one dose people are eligible for the next dose.\n\nIt seems logical that they had a reaction bad enough to make them not want to continue onto the second dose. Some may have even been serious enough to require hospitalization, some may have died. Anyway, I'll leave you to ponder it.\n\nhttps://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/",

Essentially, due to the fact that COVID caused an enormous amount of excess deaths, some people who may not directly be labeled to COVID influenced death may have an altercation in which their death is wrongly attributed. However, the amount of people who actually died of COVID but were labeled as something OTHER than COVID on their death certificate is far greater than those who died from things other than COVID. \n\nI may have phrased it poorly, but unfortunately this kind of mistranslation of data and not understanding how statistics can sometimes be incorrectly calculated when on such a grandiose scale is how we\u2019ve gone made people believe the vaccine is some farce. \n\nThe fact that COVIDs mortality rate is lower than some other diseases (during the pinnacle time of social media echo chambers) is essentially the main reasons we\u2019re having this debate. People can\u2019t wrap their heads around how something could happen in a time like today with our medical advancements. It is merely a lack of anticipation on the governments parts for improperly preparing for a pandemic. \n\nShit like this has happened in the past and if this were an outbreak of polio or influenza (something with higher mortality rates) people would be clamoring at the doors for a vaccine no matter how rushed it is.

Doctors and nurses have all the tools available to provide evidence as to what could potentially cause a medical issue. The implication here is not that doctors are not allowed to talk about \"misinformation\" but that they are actively working to hide and lie about the severity of COVID victims and hide information about severe adverse reactions to vaccines. The same would go for academics who monitor patient records or conduct their own independant studies.

If masks were to protect the surgeon from the patient's fluids spattering on them, why then wouldn't they just wear face shields, which would prevent fluids from getting into their eyes?  Are they just afraid of getting gross stuff in their mouth, but the eyes are ok?  Is that how blood communicable diseases work, only infecting you through the mouth and nose?  \n\nCould this be that they actually use masks to prevent spitting or sneezing into a patient's open wound during surgery?  If you sneezed into a face shield, which is not form fitting to your chin, doesn't the liquid follow the path of gravity...down?  Why would they wear masks for over 24 hours in some surgeries, if they couldn't breathe through them?",

States should delay further reopening until mask mandates are fully implemented, and enforcement by local businesses will be critical for preventing potential future closures.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2?fbclid=IwAR0Q3-WhHv1F9dmZSr2iLNQ-F6ioAIfOYAch7PPtHib9EsuVyhs-mYZlXcg\n\n>We detected coronavirus in respiratory droplets and aerosols in 3 of 10 (30%) and 4 of 10 (40%) of the samples collected without face masks, respectively, but did not detect any virus in respiratory droplets or aerosols collected from participants wearing face masks,\n\n\nhttps://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf\n\n>The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts.

Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020.

He did a lot of terrible things to me in 2019, and I had, more then enough reason to never talk to him again, but I decided to be the bigger person.

If you're going to take VAERS at face value and declare it proof the vaccines are deadly, you'll never see a successful vaccine for the rest of your life.

Steamed hams baby. Not only that but none of these comments, none of them can be verified. You want to believe them, then do it, nobody's stopping you. But the likelihood is very low that all of these are as a result of the vaccine. Sure, reactions happen but that they all congregate here, unlikely. It's more likely bots due to the fact there's a post like this every other week at peak hours for visibility. People are going to believe what they want to though because a bunch of randy's said it on a social media site that is bought by your corporate overlords. lol",

He's always interviewing people who are in deep with the medical details and has been spending time with trying to undo the damages wrought by the shots. (He'll email you to death but just take the info you need and ignore the rest.) Once you get into 'the clique' and knowing you're not alone... it's wonderful. Mike Adams, the Brighteon platform (TV, radio, podcasts/vids, social). These are all the folks at the cutting edge of this. \n\nSadly, if he'd had exposure to this kind of intel... he would've known better. But they're so effectively banning it. \ud83d\ude14\n\nGod bless you and your fam. \ud83d\udc95",

Why purposely try to confuse the public.  Why let the anti covax people have that ammo if it is easily refuted.   Why have another person pretend to be you.  Why is it no one has seen her anywhere.   Why did her husband change his fb to single.  Why was there a death notice listed for her.  I mean the more you dig the more obvious it is this girl is sadly deader than a doorknob.  I don't want her to be dead, I wish no one had been tricked into taking that poison.  Why so many people online talking about her being alive with zero proof.. WHy do you believe she is alive?  Can you provide proof that isn't an msm article saying she is alive and well.  Nope because she isn't.  I wish she was I really do.  It would be so simple for her to stop all the online talk about her.  So freaking simple.  If you wanted to hide from the public it would be sooo much easier to pop out say howdy and go on with your life.  People would forget all about her if she was proven without a shadow of a doubt to be alive and herself.  She would not be mentioned her anymore.  You wouldn't have to shiell about her being alive anymore.  You see how easy that would be and how much more beneficial that would be for her if she doesn't want contact or people talking about her. \" HI all, Its me Tiff.   I am not dead.... Look at me without my mask on todays date of....  Sorry I was away so long I am scared of the spotlight after volunteering to be in it on national tv.  Now that I am alive you can quit talking about me\"  That is all it would take.  We have seen photos of her.  No one will question if it is really her if it is.  No subterfuge no hiding her face.  Tiffany Dover.  Wouldn't take 15 second and she is out of the spotlight for good.  Nope she supposedly is in hiding from the scary people in the world and the press after VOLUNTEERING TO TAKE IT ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.  LOL   gmafb",

Pretty damn slim. \n\nThe chances of your father having something bad happen coincidental with something else is slim, but the chances of someone having that happen is guaranteed thousands of times over. And your father has low probabilities chances all the time. High likelihood something would happen. \n\n\nFor example, every year, 800,000 people have a stroke. That is 2,500 strokes per day. Last year, 70% of the population had boosters and doses, so 3 total days of coincidental times. With a flat distribution,  that means just by chance, about 5,000 people had strokes within a day of the shot. Same for heart attacks. That is also 800,000/year.\n\nSo that means, just by chance, 10,000 people had either a stroke or heart attack within 1 day of getting a vaccine dose, even if the vaccine dose was just a placebo.\n\n1 degree of separation with immediate family, that means about 100,000 people last year had a close family member that had a heart attack or stroke within 1 day of the vaccine.\n\nAdd +100,000 for every extra day you count since the vaccine. Within a week? 3/4 of a million people had that correlation with no causal effect.\n\nGo up 50% more if you count dangerous blood clots like some other posters here.",

I believe each Emergency authorization lasts 6 months.  If you remember about a year ago the FDA granted full approval to the Pfizer commirnaty vaccine.  Well the commirnaty vaccine was never made available, they just kept distributing the same formula that was EAU approved, so that people too naive to research were thinking they were getting an FDA approved product.  While in reality they were still getting the same poison that was never fully approved, and never will be so they can never be held responsible for all the deaths and side effects their product causes.",

He was the builder who built Babel which later became Babylon. All false religion springs from that \"great city,\" hence the prostitute is known as \"the great city\" (Rev. 17:18). Ancient religions took drugs to communicate with the spirits as a part of their religious rites. Thus, pharmakeia (pharmaceuticals) is connected to spiritism.\n\nYou want to know the true identity of Babylon the Great and how she does indeed control much big business, religion, politics, science, entertainment, banking, education, the military and more? Her identity is a \"mystery\" to most people. (Rev. 17:5).

I've been retired since 2017 & now I sale Credit Card processing for small business'. \n\nI had been working for Portland Fire & Rescue for  about 3 years  when 9/11 happened.\n\n Immediately after, like the next Monday, I showed up at a Military Recruiters office to join the Marine Corps. I didn't care about the 50% pay cut. I didn't care about having to leave my great job for probably years at a time to live in a shit hole... About  6 weeks  before I was supposed to ship out, I fell off a ladder, & broke my back. (I Had to have a lower Lumbar Fusion at 28 years old.) I could no longer go to Basic. They wanted me to heal for 2 years, then go take a new physical. I never went. Looking back, that is probably the best thing that could have happened to me. At that time, I was so Gung Ho about quitting the Fire Dept if need be, (for years at a time), & becoming a Marine. I wanted to deploy, I wanted revenge for all of the Americans that had died that day. I was willing to die for America... \n\nAnyways, I had always trusted the Govt. I believed in the Iraq & Afghanistan War. I was a Patriot through & through... Then, about 5 or 6 years later in 2011, the Department hired a young lady who I became great friends with. She was young, in her early  20's & had been raised with the internet. The younger recruits in the fire service questioned everything, still respected authority, but wouldn't just go with the flow, things had to make sense. Orders had to make sense. I thought it was great for the Dept! She took me down a rabbit hole that I have still 12 years later, never pulled myself out of.\nShe showed me all this 9/11 evidence, that I believe proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that our Government (the one I so faithfully served & wanted to fight for)  planned & executed 9/11. \nShe showed me building 7, which I had never even heard of before I met her... \nI have been awake ever since. \n\nI was never a conspiracy guy, but since meeting this person, I don't believe shit the Government says. I pretty much assume Thwy are trying to control my every action & herd me & my family into some controllable box (a metaphorical box, not litteral) they want us to exist in. \n\nThe Government does whatever is nessecarry to appease the Ultra wealthy ppl that get them elected into their positions of power, & once they are there, Thwy do everything they possibly can to hold onto that power. \n\nCovid is 100% made in a lab. & Covid is just a trial run.\n\nEducate yourself on the atrocities of the Clinton's, Bush's, Obama's, Trump's, & especially Biden's...\n\nThey are ALL crooked & they are all controlled by higher evil powers. \n\nIt's not that bad being a crazy conspiracy person. \nI'm not taliki G about Bigfoot or Bases on Mars. \n\nI'm talking about an under wealthy  secret Cabal that wants to reduce the world population to below 1 billion people. They are paying the long game & Thwy are winning. \n\nAnyways, thanks for waking up! It's nice to have you with us!",

I apologize for any typos.\n\nAround November of 2020, my mom, brother, and me ended up catching Covid. My dad did catch it but it was very mild case. He was literally able to brush it off as a slight headache. It was kinda insane just because he technically was still recovering from health issues from the year before. \n\nFast forward to around Feb 2021, my dad got the vaccine without mentioning it to anyone. Caused a lot of drama with my mom who was/is very adamant against it. In a way, I know he got it to spite her but that\u2019s a whole other story\u2026\n\nAround March-April (sorry timeline is fuzzy) he ends up having a fainting spell which ends up sending him to the hospital. His heartbeat had become irregular and basically he had a mild stroke. He ends up getting a heart stent and then a stricter regiment of medications. Plus physical therapy.\n\nHe recovered for the most part. But his mind didn\u2019t.\n\nAfter that he just started making poor health decisions (not taking his meds for one) but after getting his booster, he regressed to an almost dementia like state.  Plus ended up having to have his heartbeat shocked as well as another stent. \n\nMost days he sits in a recliner in front of our front entryway. His limbs are completely filled with fluid because of retention. He has slurred speech patterns and can\u2019t remember a lot, including my name. He can\u2019t really do anything on his own and he refuses to take essential medications. Picks on my mom who is has become his caretaker essentially. \n\nLiterally dying. On borrowed time :/\n\nIt\u2019s insane because i\u2019m not saying it was purely the vaccines fault but my dad has, begrudgingly to me, has always seemed to have nine lives.  The man has recovered from some intense stuff.  I would never think that him getting the vaccine would land him in his current state, but that\u2019s what it seems like. One thing about him, prior to the stroke, he was always good about seeing a doctor and taking medications. He took them religiously actually. Which is why I assume he was in good health for a 70 y/o.\n\nSeeing him get like this, especially after getting the booster, it has made me really question what was in them. I\u2019m not against vaccines because i understand the science but i\u2019m scared of how greed corrupts the innocence behind that. I\u2019ve heard many cases of people having strokes/clotting. What\u2019s the deal????",

Now you may think she has woken up, but it does not look like it. She been posting on Facebook about her situation, but in neither of her post she does not mention nothing about the main cause. Also in the comments, no one has nothing to said about it. Only good wishes and nice things, but there\u2019s nothing about the VACATIONS.   So it looks like she did not learn her lesson or does not see how this thing she believe so much in has ruin her life. Some people just never learn",

Both my parents were fine from the boosters, thank God, but I'm so glad they aren't getting any more of them. I'm really glad they have the sense not to get any more of the shots after seeing the minor thing that happened to me. \n\nIt's devastating that big pharma and the world governments pushed these untested shots on so many people and killed many of them in the process. I'm very sorry your dad and your whole family has suffered so much because of that. I believe the whole \"Multiple shot\" approach was fucked from the start and I don't give a shit what any scientist, DoCtOr, or news puppet says. From what I saw, a lot of people got off lucky with the first 2 shots and the boosters are where things started getting really crazy. I stopped following it because no one in my family plans to get any more boosters, but I'm honestly terrified to see what happens once people start lining up for 4th, 5th, etc. I feel really stupid for taking the shot to begin with but I consider myself lucky for only getting the Dermatographia.",

What are the odds my healthy father coincidentally has a stroke 8 hours after receiving his booster? Pretty damn slim. \n\nSince then, he\u2019s been a wreck. He hasn\u2019t been able to work, his cognitive state is decaying, his memory is awful, he has no motivation to do anything. He used to be a healthy active man, since the stroke he stopped cooking for himself, stopped exercising, eats like shit, and hasn\u2019t been able to return to his job. He\u2019s now back in the hospital for a blood clot in his leg and narrowly missed amputation. He is going to have no choice but to sell his home as he cannot continue to afford it with no income.\n\nThank you big pharma for ruining my fathers life! And taking away from mine. But of course, whenever I mentioned it to any healthcare professional, I would get shrugged off as if I\u2019m some conspiracy theorist moron. Fuck Pfizer, fuck Moderna, and fuck all the corrupt assholes who are getting rich and living with no stress while the middle class citizens suffer. Fuck you!!!!\n\nTLDR: fuck the CDC/WHO for shoving this rushed vaccine down our throat and banning other alternatives like ivermectin. All about the Benjamin I guess"
