If not, you\u2019re gonna have to come clean to your parents. Be straight with them, don\u2019t try and bullshit it, but also be careful with how you convey it. Tell him you learned about investing into India\u2019s stock market, and thought making money in investing would work out, but that you ended up losing a portion in the process instead due to the economic downturn. Tell him you used the education money and apologize profusely for it, and promise him you will pay him back the amount lost. Also, if you come from a part of India where it is customary, bow and touch his feet asking for forgiveness. Expect to get beaten, yelled at, even disowned depending how they take it. They\u2019ll likely not put anymore money into your future, and it may affect your siblings future as a result. Also expect to not want him to talk to you for a while, and expect to be on your own. But do not get depressed about this, while a lot of people photoshop this for clout, there are people like yourself who are genuine and lost a lot. There\u2019s also guys here in America who go full retard and do drugs, sex, and alcohol then end up dropping out from college which their parents spend $50k per semester sending them to. So at least you\u2019re not in that position. Focus on your education, if you get a good job use that money to invest. But neither a good job or a good marker is likely in the current global market due to the WEF bringing about a \u2018Great Reset\u2019 for their New World Order shenanigans. Good luck.",

The net between the CALLs and PUTs trades provides a credit to your account which is your max profit if all 4 legs expire out of the money. Two legs are guaranteed to always expire out of the money leaving you with the net premium in your pocket.   \nIn my case the options all expire on July 5th. Too late for you for that trade. Some time after 2PM on July 5th, place your Short Iron Condor for options expiring on July 6th. On July 6th, close out your trade as profitably as possible and repeat after 2PM and before 4PM for options expiring on July 8th and so on. \n\nNote: Because Short Iron Condor Spreads  are a Level 3 trading strategy, almost all brokerage firms require you to fill out a margin agreement before they allow you to initiate a this trade.\n\nMay the 4 be with you!",

Instead, what is happening is that they all agree on the underlying premise and ended up being wrong and lost money. They've been losing money since March 2020.\n\nSo why can't you just short a company out of business? Well, it would require the company to be in dire need of immediate capital because shorting a company doesn't make it go out of business. They go out of business by being unable to pay debt.\n\nBut why not short to push the price down and then cover when the price is lower? Because the buyers generally aren't taking leverage.

        "body": "Judging from the average post and comment on here, most of you correctly suspect that the financial service industry and financial regulations have generally fucked you over, but you then seem to think that every possible way you might get fucked, no matter how far fetched, is actually true.\n\nI'm here to tell you that a broker doesn't try to trade against you when you execute a trade, the Fed doesn't directly lend money to hedge funds to short, short ladder attacks don't exist, that naked shorting is not happening, and hedge funds generally underperform the market so they're just as stupid as anyone else.\n\n1. Brokers find counterparties to trade with through market makers. They do not want to take the risk of being a counterparty to your trade, because they have no idea whether you are informed are not. They earn money through fees and in the case of RH, by selling order flow and by having poorer execution than most brokers.\n2. The Fed lends money to banks through the discount window. Yes, it is true that the most recent quantitative easing has benefited asset prices but not the economy, so it's been a bust from a social welfare standpoint and has basically been a net transfer of wealth from people who are newly saving to the already wealthy. (The first QE in 2008 and 2009 may have been necessary, but that's a more complex story.)\n3. Short ladder attacks just don't exist. I don't know what else to say about this one.\n4. Shorting goes above 100% of shares outstanding in the following way: a share is lent to be shorted and sold short and the investor who buys that shorted share lends it out again to be shorted. In theory this could go on arbitrarily high. It's fine to want a regulation that limits the amount of shorting as a percentage of shares outstanding. I think this is sensible and would mitigate volatility but there's no naked shorting going on.\n5. [Hedge funds have been underperforming](https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/study-sheds-light-on-why-hedge-funds-are-struggling/) by 0.8% per annum on a risk-adjusted basis since 2009.\n\nHow are you actually being screwed?\n\n1. While there is not direct regulatory capture of the Federal Reserve, numerous economists that work for the Reserve have thoughts of potentially getting high paying Wall Street jobs. They almost never want to write a paper that just shits all over banks. This and the fact that they speak to banks but do not speak to us directly means that their policies lean towards helping banks. This is isn't some weird backroom moustache twirling bullshit that seems to be pushed around. Unfortunately, it's a bit worse, since it's an endemic cultural problem with incentives that are hard to untangle.\n2. High frequency trading firms / market makers like Citadel, Jane Street, and Renaissance Medallion Fund earn their alpha in the most volatile periods for two reasons: they earn wide bid-ask spreads and the market is highly predictable on a short term basis during those periods, so they're effectively front-running the herd that is leaving or entering a position.\n3. Less of a problem in WSB, but mutual fund companies launch tons of funds and only market the ones that do well obviously. They rely on survivorship bias and luck to drive assets. They make different bets in different funds and they'll certainly have a winner somewhere.\n4. Brokers try to convince you that you can beat the market. The average retail investor does not beat the market. They are the counterparty to the institutional investor who does beat the market.\n\nHow do you avoid being screwed? However boring it is, if you buy and hold a global stock ETF, no one can ever fuck with you. It barely trades.\n\nEveryone SEEMS to be super self-aware of their own intellectual shortcomings (let's call it) but ironically, people then state utter nonsense with supreme confidence and everyone pats them on the back for being correct and \"in the know.\" (\"This guy still thinks that there are two political parties in the United States. Don't you know the parties are owned by the same corporate interests?\" Wow. So insightful and edgy, even though the two parties agree on almost nothing.) It's not that hard to nab a job of some sort at a large asset manager, and the pay isn't bad either. See how it actually is. It's far more mundane and when there's evil, it's banal evil--shutting down the underperforming fund and only mentioning the outperforming ones to prospective clients or trying to explain away bad performance in overly technical terms hoping that your clients think you're smart and don't fire you.\n\nThe industry needs to change desperately. It sucks away talent to do useless bullshit. It often acts as a net transfer of wealth from investor to asset manager. But it's not what you guys think it is at all.\n\nEdit: spelling",

Oh, and for the love of Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ, take your goddamn shill bots with you. Here\u2019s some gain porn and a rundown on my main lithium plays over the last month for those of you who remember what this sub is supposed to be about.\n\nMy options plays have been primarily focused on LTHM, L.A.C., ALB, PLL, and most recently SQM. As documented on my July 26th post \\[Link\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w820yu/hey\\_retard\\_take\\_that\\_fucking\\_crayon\\_out\\_of\\_your/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w820yu/hey_retard_take_that_fucking_crayon_out_of_your/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), I was holding ALB calls, LTHM calls, and L.A.C. calls at the time, along with a bunch of shares for those twice baked, long-term tendies. By closing bell on August 2nd, I was up about $12k, loving life and draggin my nuts around like I owned the place. Then, the ER for LTHM came along and gave me the ol' dick hammer and put my nuts in a vice. I lost all the options gains from the last week in minutes. Fuckin' options. But it was then, in my darkest hour of lamenting another retarded commodity play and nursing my pancake sack, that I remembered the words of my elders and bought that fuckin\u2019 dip with some more LTHM Sept expiration calls and held on for the ride. And up we rode.\n\nAugust 10-12 I did some profit taking and narrowed my positions to just some L.A.C. Nov calls and my shares of course. I got off a little too early, but better to be early than never as my Uncle Randy always told me. By August 16th I felt like things were running too hot, so I picked the lithium company I liked the least (PLL), and flipped the switch with some OTM Sept puts. Sure as shit, down she went. Sold those off piece by piece over the next few days for nice 2 - 3 baggers.\n\nMost recently, I played some SQM calls after they missed their EPS by less than 3% and tanked (almost like I learned from the LTHM ER... that's a first). Anyone with a brain that's 69% retarded or less would have seen that even though they missed, they were still up 800+ percent YOY on EPS, so this was just a great fuckin\u2019 buy opportunity. I bought Sept and Oct exp calls on the 18th after the ER crash\u2026 FUCK, too early. Kept crashing. But I was sure, so balls to the wall on the 19th baby; deep discounted OTM calls for Sept, Oct, and Dec. Leveraged up, used some of that cruel mistress margin. No sleep all weekend - feelings of excitement mixed with self-doubt - Sunday night anxiety on a whole other level. Then came Monday, then came Tuesday, then \\*I\\* came Wednesday. Made a month's salary in just my RH account alone in less than 3 days, so like an only half-idiot investor I took some profits and am now playin the rest on house money. \n\nHere are some green lines & numbers for you if you're not big on reading.\n\n[  $8,600 on July 25th](https://preview.redd.it/p4fkcxhf1rj91.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c5deffa587b98b723ecb7d4fefc7fbccd043ba1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[  $11,040 on July 25th](https://preview.redd.it/exw2whvk1rj91.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=8816070d038e205b7bcc5feed21c193c71fea8ca)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[  $37,800 on July 25th](https://preview.redd.it/2ahu8zbo1rj91.png?width=1073&format=png&auto=webp&s=f966979199f9157cd57ebf94705568d4dcdf4da9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those of you who made it this far: I think we are going to see ATH\u2019s on most lithium stocks in the coming days/weeks, so I\u2019m still in. Just google lithium spot prices and tell me that shit ain\u2019t gearing up for a moon shot. Current options holdings are fifteen L.A.C. 11/18 $30C, ten SQM 9/16 $110C, two SQM 10/21 $120C, three SQM 12/16 $110C. My positions on shares remains largely unchanged. I am holding 900 total shares of Lithium Americas (500 in IRA, 400 in brokerages), 50 shares of Albemarle, 275 shares of Livent, 250 shares of Sigma, and 50 shares of Sociedad Quimica. I did make a few minor acquisitions with 1000 shares of Arena Minerals, 900 shares of Magnis Energy, and 150 shares of Nano One Materials as well. Good luck, and god speed you autistic fucksticks.",

While the liquidity we have raised has substantially extended our liquidity runway, the new debt we have issued, together with the higher interest rate payments that will be required in the future but have largely been deferred, will substantially increase our leverage and future cash requirements. These future cash requirements, like our deferred rent obligations, will present a challenge to our long-term viability if our operating income does not return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Even then, we believe we will need to engage in discussions with our creditors to substantially reduce our leverage. We expect to continue to explore alternatives that include new-money financing, potentially in connection with converting debt to equity, which would help manage our leverage but would be dilutive to holders of our common stock. We expect we will continue to receive from and discuss proposals with all classes of creditors. These discussions may not result in any agreement on commercially acceptable terms.",

I have visited it before to see what it was about after someone linked it and iirc I did comment there once (maybe twice as part of the same thread) about dollar cost averaging IIRC. But I'm sure if you scan my profile with one of those third party extensions used by mods you'll find that's literally the full extent of my participation on that sub. But yes when I have commented on GME since the first peak, it tends to be negative. \n\n\nI used to work in finance (not at Morgan  Stanley but a similar buldge bracket bank, although I suspect revealing that is going to make you think I'm a shill even more now). I was on multiple teams, the first of which was in middle office Clearing (although OTC Credit and Rates not Equities) so I kinda had an understanding of how the plumbing works behind the scenes for trades. The bulk of my GME related comments, while negative, centered on trying to explain how the system worked with things like T+2, the DTCC, collateral calls, Robinhood getting caught with their pants down, etc. Maybe that could be considered that to be FUD but imo that's just trying to explain the financial supply chain.\n\n\nBy the time I left banking I was working front office OTC Credit and Rates, which if you look at this Anastasia lady's LinkedIn, you'll notice is what she does as well. That's why I said I was less convinced she had anything to do with AMC after looking at her profile. At least when I had basically  that same job, granted at a different bank, we had nothing to do with retail equities. These teams are heavily siloed and don't really overlap across different products. I personally don't see why it would be different at Morgan Stanley. \n\n\nAs for OP, the way I see it is there's two possible reasons they could be receiving an email from her. The first is he works on her team, in which case, I doubt he's involved in a conspiracy with Morgan Stanley for the same reasons I don't think Anastasia is. That also explains why he has a Bloomberg. He's using his work computer (which I imagine is going to get him fired when compliance finds this post). \n\nThe second possibility is he works for one of her clients and that's a marketing email (she is in sales after all, half her job is spamming clients with those emails). I guess that could look worse if he works for a hedgefund, and I don't have first hand experience for how siloed it is on the buy side (the institutional investors side of the industry). From what I've heard online and irl is that it's pretty similar though. Teams that trade interest rate swaps and credit default swaps (his team considering he's receiving an email from her) are different from teams that would be involved with buying/shorting stocks. In this case still, thats why he has Bloomberg access and I imagine their compliance is also going to fire him when they see this post. \n\n\nAs far as whether the post itself is misleading, idk it seemed well sourced and thought out to me. Everything was linked to either an SEC filing or a screenshot from Bloomberg. That being said, I don't really follow AMC, I think this might actually be the first time I've talked about that company on reddit really so I'm not exactly in a position to verify or dispute his claims. Regarding the media, like I said I don't really follow AMC so I'll just take your word regarding FUD over the last 2 days.\n\nEdit: also to add, the reason compliance is going to fire him isn't because he used his Bloomberg to back up a reddit post or that he was posting about AMC in general. It's because sending screenshots outside the firm is a huge no no...for the very reason we're even having this discussion. You might accidentally send info in the background that is price sensitive (and if that email is what others have found regarding Virgin Active, I suspect it is price sensitive information)",

While the liquidity we have raised has substantially extended our liquidity runway, the new debt we have issued, together with the higher interest rate payments that will be required in the future but have largely been deferred, will substantially increase our leverage and future cash requirements. These future cash requirements, like our deferred rent obligations, will present a challenge to our long-term viability if our operating income does not return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Even then, we believe we will need to engage in discussions with our creditors to substantially reduce our leverage. We expect to continue to explore alternatives that include new-money financing, potentially in connection with converting debt to equity, which would help manage our leverage but would be dilutive to holders of our common stock. We expect we will continue to receive from and discuss proposals with all classes of creditors. These discussions may not result in any agreement on commercially acceptable terms.\n\n\nEDIT: I feel like I should respond here to some comments below:\n\n\\- Everything I said is factual. It's all linked to the official SEC docs of AMC or Bloomberg as a reliable source. \n\n\\- Its a fact that share count increased to 450m. its a fact that roughly 50m shares are shorted.. .its a fact that even if you add in all the call options you barely get to any squeeze .. these are all facts\n\n\\- the fact that I have access to a Bloomberg terminal does not make any difference\n\n\\- If you really think I want to drive the share price by posting here.. sorry you are bloody stupid then. AMC trades like 2.5bn every day!!.. Mr bag holder dildo with his 50 shares has no influence lol \n\n\\- yes my account is new. I looked at this once my friends asked me whether to invest in AMC or GME. I know AMC very very very well. I never looked at GME. \n\n\\- I find it irresponsible that unsophisticated people with little money gamble away all their savings by being tricked into a Hoax\n\n\\- I did this post so ppl can get the facts right \n\n&#x200B;\n\n/End of Edit\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been flagging dilution at AMC before and I want to touch on this further in this DD.\n\n# 1. AMC increased its share count from roughly 100m to 450m in the last few month alone.\n\nThis is a link to AMC latest quarterly release:\n\n[https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/0a2146ef-7cb0-43b1-b96f-33c1681e146e.html](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/0a2146ef-7cb0-43b1-b96f-33c1681e146e.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Dilution events taken from latest 8K](https://preview.redd.it/5nhq36y0edm61.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=afb291e963b75de557dcfaafd9d87c951ff24211)\n\n**Lets count just how many shares have been issued:**\n\nFrom the above picture: 15+15+20+200+50+44.4 = 344.4 . this compares to a starting share count of 103.8m so total shares out is now 448m (and that does not include all the restricted stock options management issued to themselves)\n\nWhich I estimate is another 6m.\n\n\uf0e8 Bottom line share count went up by 4.5x\n\n\uf0e8 And this is all float.. no institutional holders.. (Wanda converted there B shares to A shares to sell them)\n\n# 2. Furthermore the company will keep issuing more shares.\n\nThey have another 70m left to issue which will likely be issues in the next days to come.\n\nAnd \u2026 here it comes:\n\nThe company just filed an Annul general meeting to increase the share count by another 500m.\n\nSee this link:\n\n[http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/9f348412-ec88-4159-a092-631da0404d66.html](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/9f348412-ec88-4159-a092-631da0404d66.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMC filing to do another 500m shares](https://preview.redd.it/wul8zvh3edm61.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=c73a842dfabc32da7b9491a837069132414a7baf)\n\n# Operationally it\u2019s a severely struggling business:\n\n\\- The company burned through 125m a month in Q4\n\n\\- That burn will step up to 150m per month in H2 as management has stated at yday call.\n\n\\- They have 1bn of cash on hand but that will go down fast\n\n\\- Debt is now higher then pre corona and there is another 450m of unpaid rent\n\n\\- Share count is 4.5 pre covid .. so today\u2019s share price really means around 48USD compred to pre covid dilution \u2013 pre covid it was trading at 6-8USD\n\n\\- Remember AMC wasn\u2019t even able to generate any cash pre- covid\n\n\\- The stock rally has saved the debt holders because AMC might indeed be able to avoid bankruptcy.. but given the dilution the stock is still effectively worthless\n\nThere is not even that much squeeze potential:\n\n# Lets look at the facts:\n\n# 1. Stocks shorted 55.5m ??\n\nThat is a whopping ;) 12.3% of float\u2026. And compares to 260m shares traded yday.. so to cover all shorts you need about 20% of the daily volume.\n\nStock is liquid to borrow\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fof2wnb7edm61.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=c73dcf2434b9d689a2246eabd1af28f5d0359c98\n\nshort interest\n\n# 2. But what about a gamma squeeze ???\n\nAgain lets look at the facts.\n\nThe open interest in all calls is 1.27m .. against that we have 0.684m puts.\n\nLets totally ignore the puts which have a stable effect on the share price.. lets assume those don\u2019t exist.\n\n1.27m calls are equivalent to still a high number of 127m shares\u2026\n\nMany of these calls are out of the money..\n\nBut hey let's assume ALL the calls end up in the money.\n\nThat is 127m shares.. add that to the 55m shorted and you end up at 237m .. which is still only 50% of float!!\n\nAlso this compares to 1!!!!! Daily volume.. far from critical.\n\nMore realistically assuming a 30% delta and 50% put offset its more an extra 17m shares from calls.\n\nThis is not going to the moon.. The fundamentals are not there.\n\nThe reason why dildos get exited is that they look at outdated statistics about the shares outstanding and think it is sooo highly shorted.. but the fact is it isn\u2019t.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lz5zqgi8edm61.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=c528206d8ff289937b709421c10eeb4114a63ec9\n\nlook at open interest.. taken from bloomberg\n\n# Concluding Remarks:\n\nNow go on and downvote.. I expect nothing else from ignorance.\n\nI still hope some ppl find this post before they make stupid mistakes with their savings.\n\nI am just stating the facts.. so don\u2019t accuse me of lying without presenting any evidence.",

The stock hasn't been above $12 in over 3 months. If you bought them before this, Congrats you're on your way to big profit, if you didn't and are considering buying them now, consider how IV works and that if this stalls at all on the way up your options will lose a lot of value. \n\nThere's very little fundamental reasoning behind this company \"squeezing\".

They honestly don\u2019t care which way the stock goes. The volatility and liquidity WSB has provided will make butterfly\u2019s and iron butterfly\u2019s highly profitable with very little down side. Not to mention the many other strategies and instruments that are available to hedge funds but not retail. Retail, on the other hand, will get hammered. They don\u2019t need to misinform or manipulate. The volatility and liquidity provided by retail WSB traders is enough for them to eat your lunch no matter which way GME trades. Funny how that works out huh? And folks here think they\u2019re sticking to the man \ud83e\udd23.\n\nAlso the naked short shares were real. But now it\u2019s reading high simply because of so many trades before settlement. It\u2019s for the same reason you can see a stock with 140% institutional investment. More institutions are reporting than reported sold. In this case the clearing houses can\u2019t settle quick enough to register accurate numbers. \n\nBut one thing is clear, more retail investors will lose money from GME than make it. Hedge funds are totally taking advantage of these unique market conditions that they can profit from with very little risk. When you can go both long and short at the same time combined with options, the sky is the limit. If my broker would let me SELL multi leg options on GME I\u2019d have enough tendies to start a chain of KFC\u2019s! I could sell strategies with zero downside as the volume is so high I could construct options strategies that would totally short change the folks buying the contract. All because the liquidity and volume provided by WSB.\n\nGME is an options sellers dream!! The high demand for shares is not WSB pumping the stock silly!! It\u2019s hedge funds selling a myriad of covered and short multi leg options strategies combined with WSB pumping the stock. Who wins in that scenario? Hint, not retail!\n\nExample: What\u2019s the risk to reward ratio of a butterfly above or below current trading value with a $10 spread? Risk is zero!",

Beta in general is supposed to be measured over a long horizon, as it\u2019s used to do CAPM and other types of portfolio allocation. When GME was drifting downward against a backdrop of a bull market, it demonstrated a low beta because its performance just wasn\u2019t connected to its peers in the market.  For a period of time around the January run-up, it had an inverse correlation with the overall market, which is noteworthy but not necessarily causative.  The strength of the correlation also wasn\u2019t that great (R^2).  The beta figure that is reported by sites like Yahoo never really tell you the important parts, like \u201cover what time frame?\u201d or \u201cwith what predictive strength?\u201d  Extreme example, beta measured over a two-day period around an earning miss could show insane inverse beta\u2014just a function of the price readjustment.\n \nBTW, it\u2019s easy to test this by doing a quick regression on GME and SPY.  The negative coefficient shows up around the January squeeze-ish.  \n \nOn another note, the OP that started this beta hype misunderstood the basic premise.  If you want to add negative beta to your portfolio, pick a stock that has positive beta and short it.  To you, the beta will be effectively negative.  That does not imply that a heavily shorted stock would itself have a negative beta as that poster thought.  In fact, I\u2019d expect a heavily shorted stock to have a low beta, just like GME, as the stock tries to track with its peer group but is undermined or dragged by the shorters.",

Its one point of data but is consistent with the other sources I'm seeing. Are you saying the negative beta has been for a while making this report wrong or are you trying to say the beta changed due to historical data (if so why the sudden change) or did I miss you point completely?\n\n\nAlso thank you for powering through the downvotes I value your opinion as there's not many bearish opinions out there.",

Unfortunately, common knowledge isn\u2019t always correct knowledge. The reality is that much of the disinformation being spread on WSB right now is very pro-GME, and the new crowd here, which consists mostly of greenhorn traders (who don\u2019t really understand how the market functions) is lapping it up. The [people \u2014 600 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/) participating in this disinformation campaign often intentionally reach the wrong conclusions after overloading posts with very technical information that most greenhorn traders do not understand, or even just [make terms up](https://postimg.cc/B8W93Yth) \u2014 [Source \u2014 18.5k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5zoos/gme_how_the_dip_today_was_due_to_etf_shares_being/)\n\nThere are many common tricks they use to positively manipulate sentiment surrounding GME. I wrote about it a bit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m68ybj/comment/gr6asm3?context=3). Unfortunately, that post was deleted by Automod when I edited a YouTube link into the text, and the mod team did not respond to requests to restore the post.\n\nRegardless, I\u2019ve noticed many of the same pro-GME talking points being recycled \u2014 often by brand new accounts that have a post history of begging for karma and posting exclusively about GME. You can love the stock, that\u2019s fine, but if you *really* love the stock, it\u2019s important to know how you\u2019re being misled and lied to by posts that frequently hit the front page. In this thread, I\u2019ll be addressing [this post \u2014 21.1k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m79wdx/why_the_gme_moass_mother_of_all_short_squeezes_is/) specifically, and I\u2019ll also be linking to similar shady posts that parrot the same baseless or misleading claims.\n\n**Claim #1: GME is inversely-correlated with the broader market because the squeeze forces institutions to sell long positions to protect against margin calls**\n\nThere does seem to be *some* correlation between GME and the broader market, but this doesn\u2019t imply causation (or shorts getting squeezed). It\u2019s not uncommon for meme stocks to do well while the rest of the market is selling off. [Exhibit A](https://postimg.cc/PvGJgzYY) \u2014 [Exhibit B](https://postimg.cc/1VpXsnrT) \u2014 notice how RIOT\u2019s peak in 2018 coincides with SPY\u2019s trough? That\u2019s correlation, but not causation. Why does this happen? I can\u2019t say for sure, but my guess is that stocks like this have a lot of volatility, so when funds pull out of the broader market, they place their wealth in these volatile stocks as kind of a \u201cstore\u201d of wealth until the sell-off is finished, at which point they cash out and re-enter the market. Just speculating, though.\n\nWhat I *can* prove, however, is that the claim that the broader market and GME are inversely correlated is **complete bullshit**, and it takes only [the barest, most basic amount of research](https://postimg.cc/jDjfQcXS). Here, I\u2019ve overlayed the S&P 500 with GME. If there were any correlation, you would see GME go down roughly whenever SPY went up, and vice-versa. Not good enough? Think GME ought to be valued as a tech company? [Nasdaq similary shows no correlation](https://postimg.cc/VdgMCpXh). Yes, I know the overlays aren\u2019t perfect, but I\u2019m working on an iPad here \u2014 cut me some slack. Regardless, you can see there is **no correlation**, proving that this part of Bows_N_Hoes post is **bullshit**.\n\nFor the record, I *do* think there was an inverse correlation between GME and the broader market back in February. In my opinion, there genuinely was a threat of system collapse. The IBKR chairman himself admitted that. (Request a link to the vid in comments and I\u2019ll provide. I can\u2019t post it in OP or my post will get whacked). In this case, hedge funds likely *did* have to sell some of their positions to free up liquidity so that they could cover or protect their shorts. This led to the broader market falling while GME squoze. As demonstrated, this correlation no longer exists.\n\nNote: This claim is about inverse correlation is the same as [another unfounded claim \u2014 4.4k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6if56/the_mythical_unicorn_aka_extremely_abnormal/) that hit the front page of WSB, and which one of WSB\u2019s mods similarly dismantled.\n\n**Claim 2: The illegal practice of naked short selling is causing the stock to show over 140% ownership**\n\nThe post claims that short shares are being invented out of thin air and sold on the market. While this is theoretically possible (but illegal!), this is pure speculation. So how then, might you ask, can a stock display over 100% ownership? When stocks are shorted, they are *borrowed* from someone who owns the stock, and then sold. Now, the same shares can be lent from one person to another to another. All of the entities borrowind the stock must report ownership of the stock. So, imagine it this way: I lend my dildo to my friend, and then *he* lends that dildo to *his* friend. I would report owning that dildo, my friend would report owning that dildo (albeit temporarily) and *his* friend would report owning that dildo. So you see how one single dildo can become three? [Investopedia even has an article about this](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp ). The same thing is happening to GME, and any claims that higher than 100% institutional ownership being indicative of the illegal practice of short selling is pure speculation, of which no one has yet provided proof.\n\n**Claim #3: No seriously, these \u201csynthetic shares\u201d are real, and are being sold back and forth on the market place!**\n\nDo you know what you get when you Google \u201csynthetic shares\u201d? A bunch of [Indian biomed companies](https://postimg.cc/FYc2syMD) with \u201csynthetic\u201d in their company name. Do you know what happens when you control for these Indian biomed companies?  You get results that are [basically nothing](https://postimg.cc/xcBw2x4X). If \u201csynthetic shares\u201d were a real phenomenon, you wouldn\u2019t have to go digging through this many foreign small-cap biomed companies to find any information about it. And before anyone chimes in, snthetic call options and put options *are* real, but those are **very** different from what OP is claiming.\n\n**Claim #4: Hedge funds are totally getting squeezed by GME\u2019s rise!**\n\nPeople who make this claim often resort to proving it by:\n\n* using complex calculations\n\n* depend on incomplete data\n\n* make suppositions\n\n* discard any data that disproves their claims\n\n[Source \u2014 600 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/)\n\nHowever, we don\u2019t need to do any logical loop-de-loops to prove that GMe doesn\u2019t have an exceptionally high level of short interest. In fact, all we have to do is go to [an old fan favorite of WSB](https://isthesqueezesquoze.com/) to see the true story laid out for us in a very clear, concise argument.\n\nHere, we have a few important metrics:\n\n*Short interest \u2014 16% \u2014 the amount of shares short as a percentage of the float \u2014 while 16% is atypically high, it\u2019s nowhere *near* the purported 100-350% [some suspicious people](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/) with one-month old accounts are shilling.\n\n* Borrow rate \u2014 0.6% \u2014 particularly low. Borrow rates \u2014 that is, the rate people are paid to lend out the stock on a yearly basis \u2014 go up a lot the more a stock is shorted. For reference, RKT was at 20% a few weeks ago.\n\n* Borrow availability \u2014 300,000 shares \u2014 the most heavily shorted stocks often appear as \u201cno shares available for shorting\u201d for a long time \u2014 *days, even* \u2014 since their shares are so in demand to borrow and sell short.\n\nSo there you have it. Three very simple, easy metrics you can use to verify that the stock is not as heavily shorted as some people want you to believe. To believe otherwise would mean you would have to buy in to conspiracies about a wide-ranging collaboration between various market participants and entities with differing aims, ethics, and stakes, involving thousands of people, and all to cover up the true short rate of just *one* stock. [Occam\u2019s Razor, y\u2019all](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNow you have to ask yourself \u2014 do you like the *stock* or do you like the *hype*? Because if it\u2019s the former, then you should not be supporting the people continually spreading disinformation about it. If it\u2019s the latter, then have fun on this wild ride, but don\u2019t lie or support lying to your fellow WSBers. It\u2019s immoral,  and it;s not cute when somekne points out these lies and incosistencies and all you can say is \u201ctl;dr, buying more\u201d.",

Albert Einstein once said, compound interest is the greatest mathematical discovery of all time. Lets play pretend.

Oh btw not only that, the dip buyers have now acquired 25% compound interest if they held. Now comes the bear market...If I was the owner of Apple or I was the main strategist, id let the stock go to $1, just like Luna. Now we file for bankruptcy and id tell Daddy Powell, \"No no don't bail us out, because if you bail us out we will still have these fat leeches with 25% compound interest\". \"Daddy Powell?

The govt had too much control and fucked up all sorts of stuff.

Small ones only. But the various local authorities needed $$$ to develop themselves, and investors wanted some sort of foundation before investing.\n\nCue LGFVs and their promise foe delivering $$$ as they were \"private companies\" which could get loans not just from the CCP but from all over the place. Not just loans, but also attract investors not looking in local govt financing. Because, after all, this is just a \"private company\".\n\nSo local chinese communities now how private, decentralized, unrecorded loans. What could go wrong, right?\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nThe base drop came when the CCP *tried* to get an estimate on LGFVs and badically shit their pants realizing even their low estimates were metric fucktons that they knew the local govts couldnt handle. And by that point developing land had become a sort of default investment not just for international investors into china, but even local chinese investors.\n\nTheir entire local development was funded on mountains of unregulated debt and the CCP has been america-ing the debt and playing kick the can, but between the LGFVs and  actual private companies getting overwhelmed, the chinese housing and real estate market is one gigantic timebomb nobody wants to acknowledge, because doing so is akin to acknowledging how every mortgage rating agency leading up to 2008 was full of shit.",

Instead, they are full of new builds that were bought as investments. They're also a symptom of mismatched supply and demand.\n\"These homes being empty means they are sold out to investors and buyers, but not occupied by either the owners or renter,\" Xin Sun, a senior lecturer in Chinese and East Asian business at King's College London, told Insider.\nOn the supply side, Sun said, the government gets big sales revenue from leasing out land to developers. \"This gives the government very strong incentive to encourage development instead of limiting it,\" he said.\n\n\nChina can stop a transaction. The government can change the number of years you have to own a home. Or if prices are too low, the government won't give you a certificate of sale,\" Gan said. \"That is what's happening now.\"\n\"You won't see the price drop substantially, but you will see the transaction volume drop massively,\" he added. \"They'll stop the sale. By doing that, they can prevent the look of a massive price drop. They can prevent the crash.\"",

Heres why.\n\nChina imminent collapse.\n\nWar in Russia.  Nato escalations. \n\nWorld wide shortages. \n\n Cryptocurreny collapse.\n\nLet me start with \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 \n\nChinas economy has run rampant for the last 20 years.  The United States borrows trillions from China.  However, China is in a deeper bubble than we have ever seen.  \n\nChinas main source of economy is in real estate.   Do you know there are abaondoned sky scrapers in China right now?  Its like detroit had a baby with dubai.  They built a city for 10 million people and cant even get 100,000 to buy the properties. The banks print out real estate loans more than Jpow is printing out singles.\n\nThis happened in dubai as well, I'm not sure on current affairs but i remember all the sports cars like Ferrari and Mclarens left abandoned in parking lots and the desert after they defaulted and left country before they got their heads chopped off. (Serious arab law)\n\nToday you can explore abandoned high rises in china, some half constructed abandoned.\n\nIn 2021 Q4 484 chinese businesses defaulted on their major real estate payments. (This should be double digits)\n\nOn top of all of this, covid has run absolutely rampant to the point they are locking people in \ud83c\udf4e factories and can't leave.  This may be what pops the bubble but I would not put a nickel of my burger king check into any China owned companies. Have you all tried to buy a car lately?  You cant.  China and all of the nafta companies aren't producing near enough goods.  If you can't sell you cant make tendies.\n\nIf and when the bubble burst it will shake up an already rattled global economy with the \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 war.   I think this year possibly next the united states will enter into the war. \n\nAlready ships like the USS Kearsarge are in route to the Baltic Sea arrived 24hours ago\n\nI would guess a 5-10 trillion dollar loss on NASDAQ overnight is possible could be this year if announce of the war, I'm sure it will start with a russian attack that hits american troops, a plane or an embassy.  The moment this happens (it will) you need to start shorting before the boomers pull out of their 401k.  \n\nIf you already havent pulled out of your 401k consider it, transfer it to a roth ira or something like S&P500 on td ameriteade thats setup for retirement where you can pull out quickly. \n\nOn top of that the ticking time bomb of China we got a goold old great depression cooking.  \n\nAnyways boys\n\nPositions:\nLockheed\nRaytheon",

        "body": "First, I'm not talking about any squeeze potential, which can happen to either/both stocks. I'm interested in the business models of these companies.\n\n**Intro**\n\nI think many people are familiar with the RKT/UWMC feud after the RKT squeeze put both in the spot light. UWMC issued an ultimatum to mortgage brokers to stop working with other companies, which supposedly 90% of their existing broker partners agreed to. Many people here and on other subreddits are invested, and claiming each of these companies are significantly undervalued. I just want to put things into perspective from the business model side and future outlook side. \n\n**Business Model - direct lending and broker lending**\n\nFirst, let's talk about their business models. RKT is fairly diversified a number of lending businesses, with their TPO division for brokers but majority of their mortgage lending business direct to consumer. On the other hand, UWMC only deal with mortgage brokers, who make their cut between the lender and consumer. \n\nIn general, consumers with good credit and who has long standing existing banking relations with a bank or credit union will go there first. They may compare a few lenders to get the best rate, but generally working with lenders directly, especially if they know someone in the business. Only when you have a special circumstance on your credit history/rating or when you can't get a satisfactory loan directly from your local lenders, then your realtor may suggest going to a broker. Brokers make money because they may be able to get you a loan that otherwise you may not (or shouldn't) qualify for. This actually contributed a lot to the mortgage default crisis in 08. \n\nWhen I bought my first house I had a special circumstance for my loan application and couldn't get the loan size that I wanted with lenders, and my realtor suggested we can go find brokers who can find high interest rate loans of that size, some of them even from private lenders. Luckily we were able to find a credit union that could work with us. But you get the gist - mortgage brokers sometimes work with (and sometimes prey on) people with low credit who can't loans directly from lenders, and this is what they get paid for. Not all brokers are bad, but there is definitely a \"car salesman\" feeling from them. In the end, I would think the loans that brokers push through are in general more risky than direct to consumer loans. I don't work in the business but people who do could find some statistics. When rates starts to rise, and also after the mortgage moratorium end, the first to default will be these higher interest rate loans from brokers. I think RKT is positioned better than UWMC in a higher interest rate environment.\n\n**Innovation and growth**\n\nThis will go hand in hand with the valuation section below. Brokers, no matter what they are brokering, are a thing of the past. With information and technology, the trend is definitely for individuals to browse and pick on their own. This is not to say everything should be automated. Especially for a big purchase like a house, professional help is needed and this is why realtors still have a job even with the rise of Zillow and Redfin etc. But professional help is really only need for getting legal things done and for things that requires tacit skills like negotiating prices on an offer. Mortgage requirements are for the most part set in stone and rates are mostly non-negotiable. So what is the job of the broker? They just aggregate information for you, which technology is poised to do just as well, if not better. Technology also brings transparency so everyone's competing on a level field; you don't need to \"know a guy\" to get your loan at the best rates for your situation. This kind of no frills experience is the new way of doing business and led to the rise of Zillow, Carmax, lemonade, etc. RKT is trying to do that and this is what will transform the mortgage industry, not someone like UWMC, who is just trying to squeeze both the brokers and consumers to get more profits in the short term and stay alive.\n\n**valuation** \n\nA lot of people are talking of each companies valuations relative to many metrics like sales and earnings. You cannot compare these ratios to the tech and meme growth stocks that we are all so familiar with. Just go to finviz and put in P/S under 4 and see how many companies show up. If a company doesn't have high margins and/or potential for exponential growth, they will not and should not carry a huge P/S ratio. For UWMC, I don't see any way this company can grow very fast or innovate, especially given their hostile attitude towards their own broker partners. For RKT it's harder to say whether their technologies like the mostly automatic underwriting process, and also their attempt to have good UI and customer service, is enough to be deserving of a high valuation. But at least I do see them transforming the traditional mortgage business and I think they stand a high chance of maintaining their rapid growth as more tech-savvy people start to purchase homes.\n\n**Summary**\n\nDon't just buy into UWMC because they spiked later than RKT and they \"seem like an undervalued\" stock. A quick look at the different approaches of these two companies clearly reveals who is the innovative \"sleeping giant\" and who is the boomer stock. While both may be good speculative short term plays, if you are serious long term investor I would take a long and hard at these companies.\n\nNot financial advice, just my 2 cents on these two hot tickers. I'm holding RKT shares and leaps, invested before the spike, sold some profit and hold the rest for medium to long term.",

Buy long and hold and there\u2019s no further capital requirements.  You only win or lose when you sell or a company goes bankrupt.\n\nYou can\u2019t short and hold without further capital requirements when the price substantially rises.  Besides the interest paid to short, if you get caught in the squeeze you\u2019d either need to cover the capital requirements to maintain the short or be forced to buy at market price.  Kind of like buying long on margin, except your capital requirements are limited to 2x your buy price (price goes from whatever you bought it from to zero).  With a short, your capital requirements if the price goes up are unlimited, and your gains are limited to 2x your buy price.\n\nIf you placed a short now and had 30x+ in further liquidity behind it you might weather a squeeze and make money on the other side.  But nobody does that.  You don\u2019t hold 30x+ liquidity for a possible 2x gain and a 30x+ loss.\n\nEdit:  I was replying to a downvoted post, but in true retard fashion appear to have drunk replied to the OP.  I\u2019ll continue drinking while my wife\u2019s boyfriend has fun upstairs.  I am long GME and joined the party on the dip Thursday when RH accounts got locked out and I could still trade through WF, because the line needed to be held.",

Let me be clear, I'm about to describe a hypothetical situation, this is purely my own theory and is not to be considered as factual or confirmed in any way.  Saying that, I would love to see an investigation.  Here goes my hypothetical:\n\nIs it possible that Melvin Capital only naked shorted some of their GME positions, and that Citadel LLC (the hedge fund) is actually the supplier of a significant portion of borrowed shares that Melvin Capital shorted?  GME stock is now very valuable and Citadel LLC would have a vested interest in Melvin Capital buying back those shares and returning them to Citadel LLC in this scenario.  This would explain why Citadel LLC provided Melvin Capital with a cash injection to help them buy back its shares.  Demand for GME is high due to WSB, and Citadel LLC in this scenario would stand to make a fortune selling it's shares to hungry retail traders.  If Melvin Capital went bankrupt, Citadel LLC (if it indeed was the supplier of some Melvin Capital GME shorted shares) could not recoup the majority of this highly profitable stock.  It further stands to reason in this hypothetical, that Citadel Securities (a Citadel LLC subsidiary which is Robinhood Financial LLC's largest trading partner, accounting for a significant portion of Robinhood's trading revenues) would pressure Robinhood to prevent its customers from buying GME shares and force sell those purchases made on margin.  This would deflate the price on GME allowing Citadel LLC to recoup more  shares from Melvin Capital to sell to retail investors.  In this, again, completely hypothetical scenario; once Citadel LLC is back in possession of it's GME shares, poof!  The restrictions on Robinhood's platform would be lifted and Citadel LLC would be sitting on goldmine.\n\nThe only problem with this completely unconfirmed scenario, is that there is meant to be a business separation firewall between Citadel Securities and its parent company Citadel LLC.  The two businesses are legally required to act as two completely separate companies.  Any sharing of information between the two regarding their positions and strategy would be considered a conflict of interest to the fair market.  I mean that would be highly illegal market manipulation, so of course that wouldn't happen.\n\nBut what do I know? I eat \ud83d\udd8ds and lick \ud83e\ude9fs",

As we also know, Melvin got an emergency cash infusion of $2.75 billion last Monday from Citadel and Point72 to help them with their GME shorts. \n\nOn a post the other day someone sent the following helpful [link with positions hedge funds have](https://hedgefollow.com/stocks/GME).  Did a search for GME and at the bottom of the Top 20 hedge funds that own GME is Citadel With 111.8k shares which is only .01% of their portfolio.  It says their position is new but believe this list is as of Q4 2020.  This is confusing me as this position contradicts their support of Melvin which may be going bankrupt if we have our way.  Unless they are holding to hedge the support of Citadel?   Any thoughts on this?  I want to see both Melvin and Citadel go bankrupt and hate to see one of them profit off GME mooning.\n\nDoes anyone have an updated list of hedge fund positions or a list of what stocks hedge funds are shorting?\n\nTLDR, Why does Citadel have a long position in GME?  I don\u2019t want to see them make a dime off of GME mooning.  \n\nF*ck Melvin! F*ck Citadel! F*ck Shitron! F*ck Robinhood!

I took some profit out of it today to take advantage of discounts across the market on other positions I'm in (mainly Lucid).\n\nThe problem is comparing \ud83c\udf7f, which could very well fizzle out tomorrow, to GME, which would require a miracle at this point to backtrack before the squeeze really happens. I'm rooting for \ud83c\udf7f and I hope it does squeeze. But it isn't a sure thing at this point. And I'm not going to tell you to buy it or hold it.

The beauty of stocks is that you can own more than one.\n\nAMC opened today at 4x the price, after trending up for days. It bounced around half its ATH of $35, before closing at 300% gain for the day.\n\nGME hit $380 today, up six times its all time high of $63. The current GME price scares away non-autist retail investors, and at that price, new buyers will be expending multiples more capital for the same upward pressure.\n\nIf you don't believe me, look at the numbers. As GME is hitting mainstream and is the big hotness on this sub, AMC also outperformed GME by 165% by close today.\n\nAlso, #saveAMC is already trending as it gains traction across social media. People are actively looking for a new GME they feel they missed the boat on.\n\nhttps://www.thestreet.com/investing/amc-shares-outerspace\n\nhttps://twitter.com/reddittrading/status/1354479260363354117\n\nDespite how low the price already was, it has a record number of shorts: over 38 million. This means another short squeeze isn't just on the menu - it's already starting. It's the third most shorted stock out there, despite its clearly viable future. This doesn't distract from GME's slaughter of hedge funds because it's the next wave of their an hero.\n\nhttps://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/\n\nhttps://highshortinterest.com/\n\nAMC has raised a billion dollars to weather out coronavirus, amid an ongoing \"Safe & Clean\" push. Some studios like WB are moving to parallel releases on HBO Max, but AMC is already throwing out deals to get people in the door. Meanwhile, Hollywood has been sitting on blockbusters after watching Tenet and WW1984 eat shit on streaming:\n\nhttps://variety.com/2021/film/global/amc-raises-debt-financing-1234891278/\n\nhttps://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean\n\nhttps://screenrant.com/tenet-box-office-failure-warner-bros-2021-movies-impact/\n\nTheir debt/equity ratio has also been trending positively, even as coronavirus has intensified. Just a return to the mean suggests ridiculous gain, even ignoring the likelihood of pent-up demand. AMC has legs not just for the next week, but for the next few quarters.\n\nhttps://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMC/amc-entertainment-holdings/debt-equity-ratio\n\nCoronavirus, the main cause for AMC's big downturn, is on the way out as vaccines will be available to all by spring, just ahead of summer blockbuster season.\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-biden-anyone-spring/\n\nIn the long term, after hedge fund shorters lose their ass on GME, brick and mortar game stores will have less of a future, with or without coronavirus. It's easier to digitally download games, and hardware can be bought online and received the next day from any number of retailers. There's no way to mount a 20 foot screen in your house. Unless, of course, you buy AMC stock now.\n\nEdit: lol\n\n> Hi!\n\n> You have been added to r/ControversialClub because this post of yours from r/wallstreetbets was one of the most controversial posts of the last hour on all of Reddit!

He gets it at a good price, about 100k.  Friend sees his new house, and falls in love with it, and offers to buy it.  Guy tells him fine, he'll sell it to him for 150k.  Well a week later Guy has seller's remorse, so he finds Friend and asks if he can buy the house back.  Friend tells him sure, but that he needs to make a profit for it to be worthwhile, so he tells Guy that he can buy it back for 200k.  Well this keeps going on between the two men for months, until one day Friend goes to see Guy to buy the house back from him.  When he makes an offer, Guy tells him sorry, but that a another man offered 1.5 million for it and he sold it off.  Friend is incredulous, and says, \"What?!  You got rid of it?!  But it was making us both so much money!\"",

Projected Price using Benjamin Graham Formula\n\n1a. SQR ((15)(1.5)(.1)(0.2939)) = 0.81 (actual value per share)\n\n2. P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)\n\n2a.

Also, if I am wrong please correct me - I only would like to learn more about the market, so I can eventually lose $5,000,000 in an earnings call.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent Price = 10.12\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not want to mess up the momentum of $GME or $AMC, I am only posting this because in the same way that we LIKE those stocks, I think we should also be open to DISLIKING some of the worst stocks on the market. Especially stocks with ties to CNBC and the other hedge fund assholes who have enslaved us with debt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Full Disclosure: I do not have access to margin with my brokerage therefore limiting my ability to make this trade.

The slv battle is mostly being fought by the gold bugs aka the boomers aka people with more money than us. They've been inspired by our movements, so they want to stand up and do something right. It's just that they don't believe in buying GME at $400 a share or whatever price it may be tomorrow. These boomers know and believe in Silver because they were around when fiat was backed by any physical asset such as gold and silver. It makes more sense for them to buy gold and silver for what they believe in. Not everyone is an autists who can throw money at GME even if it's at hundreds of dollars per share. Full disclosure. I'm an autist and I bought GME shares for the cause.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point is stop bashing these boomers for trying to do something they believe in. Let them do whatever the fuck they want with SLV. You don't have to buy if you don't agree. They support our cause and we should support their cause as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApes power!",

Virtually every object in your field of view requires it at some point in the production chain.  22 gallons of clean water to make a pound of plastic.  900 gallons of water per pot plant per growing season, give or take.  If you don't own enough water, then you're paying someone else for the right to exist, every day.\n\nNext step, productive agricultural land.  Common estimates run around a quarter acre per human being for basic needs.  Because the parts of you that aren't made of water are mostly made of food.  Lazy folk with big plots have realized that you can just lease land to farmers and they'll make food and hand you money.\n\nBonus points if you can snatch up some ag land with clean water under it, or at least irrigation rights.

One APE preferred equity unit represents 1/100th of the underlying preferred stock with regards to voting and economic privilege's.\n\nSo basically, the underlying preferred stock, of which 10,000,000 of were issued, is worth 100x that of an APE unit/the common AMC stock. And guess, what, it's not even listed. They basically have just as many votes as all of retail in both AMC and APE combined due to these 10,000,000 preferred shares that they issued.\n\nSure they need a vote to convert APE into class-a common stock, but retail are not the only ones voting. This is sneaky by AMC, they won't mention the 10,000,000 shares they issued and nobody is talking about this.\n\nHere are some quotes from the filing:\n\n\"The AMC Board is authorized, without further approval, to establish, one or more series of preferred stock...\"\n\n\"On August 4, 2022, the Company filed a Certificate of Designations with the Secretary of the State of Delaware designation 10,000,000 shares of the Company's authorized preferred stock as Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock..\"\n\n\"The issuance of our preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the trading price of our commonstock, restricting dividends on our capital stock, diluting the voting power of our common stock...\"\n\nEdit: Use your brains people, they issued 10mil preferred shares, and they aren't being listed. Who do you think owns these shares? Why do you think these preferred shares have such insane voting privileges, when preferred shares usually have NO voting privileges? Why do you think they issued 10,000,000? Is it because that number is basically exactly how many shares they would need to issue in order to match the 1 billion shares that will be in circulation (of APE and AMC)? Remember, the preferred shares have the voting power of APE x 100. 10,000,000 x 100 is what?? 1 billion. Hm. What a crazy coincidence",

It eventually got to $11, but we may not see that unless other large downward market trends occur at the same time. This stock drops with the S&P and all the major indexes and a drop may be coming after the CPI numbers (high uncertainty if the numbers come out great and if bad then inflation is still a major problem). I\u2019m planning on watching the price action to see if the trend holds upward even on a red day in the spy and scaling in when I see weakness.",

Easy short, puts into and after ex dividend date = free money (???). Bulls r insanely fk.**\n\nPositions: 12 puts in range 19-22 for september monthly expiry initially. Will scale into more degen bets in the coming weeks. I am not early, but others are seemingly stupid giving us the chance to grab puts on the cheap after news which should have tanked the stock price\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nPOST BEGIN: \n\nAs most of us know AMC had earnings on thursday after hours. It was a sought after earnings as AA had been hinting to something big happening, a \u201cpounce\u201d some might say. What this proved to be was a Preferred stock dividend with the ticker $APE (lol). Most people were let down by this, some were excited, but if you look under the hood it is insane how the AMC stock price as of today ended the day up over 18 % and you might think how the fuck did that happen? Earnings sucked balls!  AMC had a shitton of [FTDs due](https://stocksera.pythonanywhere.com/ticker/failure_to_deliver/?quote=AMC) this week as can be seen below, but thats not important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMC Failure to delivers due last week](https://preview.redd.it/mxehqxv44ag91.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1bcb882183c29e836484ba4db7642f1de9364af)\n\nLast year AMC sought shareholder approval for an issuance of an additional 25 million shares to raise cash, but shareholders dissapproved of this as the apes had gotten tired of getting diluted. With AMCs current cash burn rate and their deferred rent payments at the time they did not have a lot of runway left before an inevitable bankruptcy unless they drastically improved their business. The most recent quarter AMC posted a loss to the tune of 121.6 million $, no share dilution approved still, but in comes AA with \u201cthe pounce\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h3j29n094ag91.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=59d214161b1c4ad120a9bd5cc0628cae63403045\n\nWhat this pounce actually turned out to be was a big middle finger to all the investors who disapproved of their requested 25 million share dilution last year. He did not only find a way to get this dilution without shareholder approval. He did not double down, not quadruple down but 100x double down by issuing a new stock which have the exact same voting rights as AMC common stock on the conversion from APE to AMC (lol).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i2nsjn4b4ag91.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=036c24175ab6380e1f0217c858fe7eb1eb7b6eed\n\nThis new ticker which we all know as $APE will give AA and the C-suite the ability to dilute it up to 4.5 billion shares after it has started trading on the NYSE. AA says black on white this was his plan B if investors didnt approve of a dilution (He always finds a way to dilute ;) )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c9rqlw1c4ag91.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=b85d3ade469cfc0f2a1962658407c7b640416510\n\nHe is also no stranger to dilution. Through the late parts of 2021 and first half of 2021 he diluted like his life depended on it as we see in the image below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wynx9sd4ag91.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3b7471f7e02b022634b519182b862a4e2e456a1\n\nSome might say \u201cbut the APE dilution doesn\u2019t matter as AMC wont be diluted so my shares should retain their value\u201d. This is wrong because the $APE shares have literally all the properties AMC have when it comes to the vote for conversion. The \"vote for conversion\" if passed would make it so that one share of APE will be convertable into 1 common share of AMC. And if that vote passes 1 share of ape is identical to 1 share of AMC. You control majority vote through either APE or AMC you control the company. Its literally the same stock, but a different ticker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z3h50dgf4ag91.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=06d5ee53885fe28a6b00ec2b1d4288965ac33820\n\nIn the relevant SEC filing on page 2 we find the following: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2cz2w0fj4ag91.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=a74fc0cded085ec7ac68a708ad3544b83e5e95a8\n\nFrom the same document we have black on white that they can dilute the APE token without seeking any shareholder approval\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jm8gbgbm4ag91.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=120d056291fab55c9b7bf9a9ac3142778d7398d2\n\n So both preferred stock units and common shares get the same voting power and can vote on the common stock amendment. AA can dilute the preferred stock by up to 4.5 billion shares. Assuming retail owns the entire float of AMC (this is not true) that means they will have to buy up after full dilution a minimum of 1.739 billion APE tokens from all dilutions to exclude any chance of being outvoted by any others on the conversion vote from $APE to $AMC common stock. Retail simply does not have that capital, and to be frank they do not own the float on AMC. Last shareholders meeting had a total of 268,775,910 voters as can be seen in the relevant SEC filing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l9gmhkep4ag91.png?width=729&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9fe7726220b88445c73ee355184390ccef64877\n\n What\u2019s even more funny is now during the weekend Adam Aron himself is admitting its a dilution on twitter and is floundering around trying to \u201ccalm\u201d his investors stating this is \\*\\*Good diluton\\*\\* and not bad dilution.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zbmk4svq4ag91.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=98d1faf1e1ae23de7eee4fc24ddfc414d1b32645\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqe4l8ds4ag91.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac810d60a466eab221e3c167e18c0bcb87002dc3\n\n \n\nFrom history AA is gonna dilute APE fast and dilute it hard to raise more capital to use on new acquisitions. Who knows, maybe he buys another unprofitable mine with shareholder raised money.",

If GME for some reason sold shares at a hefty premium, but well below its current price, it's leaving a lot of cash on the table and basically acting against its shareholders. \n\nWhether you like it or not, a publicly traded company has a responsibility (fiduciary duty) to its shareholders first.

Congratulations.\n\nI am not saying the populist anger isn\u2019t justified or that our system is not flawed or that these hedge funds didn\u2019t fuck up by shorting something with such a large short float. But sometimes it\u2019s good to stay calm and analyze things rationally and consider the following opinions from someone who was burned by the short selling ban in 2008 and lost my shirt with my puts in 2012 betting on a cascading bank failure in European when Draghi announced LTRO. There are a lot of things that can go wrong with the infinite money machine thesis.\n\nThe more the price of GME rises, the likelihood that the SEC will institute a short term trading ban on the stock increases. But vegaseller, you say, we will just Hold and when it resumes  our infinite money wormhole will work again, time is on our side, the shorts have massive margins interests which are compounding.\n\nThe problem will be when a private deal is negotiated between GME management and a short seller consortium. It is highly likely there are already negotiations underway between some individual short sellers and the company on a private deal to issue new shares at a significant premium, although much lower than the current market price. Management will be happy to double the shares outstanding at anywhere from $20-100 shares/share, a considerably discount to the current share price. Their concerns are retiring their existing debts and generating cash on their balance sheet for a pivot rather than maintaining their current shares price.\n\nAnd the higher the run-up in GME share price, the greater the incentive for short sellers to form a consortium and reach a private deals with management and the greater incentive for management to close a deal towards a higher price range. Once a deal is largely settled, they will loop the SEC in to institute a temporary trading halt on the stock. \n\nIf this happens, you guys would be left holding the bag and the share price could easily drop to $10-$50.\n\nThere is no shame in taking some money out. Just here to point out how the shorts can still get out at a much lower cost than you think. Again it\u2019s just food for thought, make your own judgement.",
