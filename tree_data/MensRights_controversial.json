I also believe that Civilization is an inevitable result of human nature, the natural byproduct of a process eloquently [described recently in a comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ifl95/strausskahn_its_rape_if_she_says_it_is_comment/c23jt8f) by bautin.  Everything is coming to a head right now because we've reached a maximum point in complexity that can be supported by the resources of this planet.  Those of us who fail to understand the core physical basis of biological survival are doomed.  This includes, especially, feminists who misunderstand the problem in simplistic terms of man vs. woman, and have the hubris to believe they can cancel a million years of evolution by wish and decree, as well as the white knights who mistakenly support their misguided ideals.\n\nIn addition, I believe that Civilization is stratified in such a way that the myth of Patriarchy, in the feminist sense of the term, is allowed by elite classes to flourish in order to weaken lower social strata and make its members, both men and women, more pliable to social control. \n",

The materialistic society we live in today is primarily powered by women. Men in general would desire to exist in the complete opposite situation to that which western countries exist. To me middle east countries like Afghanistan are examples of patriarchy and countries like America are matriarchies. For fucks sake America comes from Britain where the Queen rules all.\n\nAsk yourself why the root of maternal is mater similarly to materialistic, etc.\n\nIn my opinion women are more materialistic and rely on the material for security. The problem we have in countries like America is that not only have women become overly materialistic but men are failing to uphold their role which is to tell women they have too much shit and need to shut the fuck up. Instead all the men are out their like IDIOTS running around for the best job to get the best house to keep the best stuff for their soul sucking wives who will punish them mercilessly if they fail.\n\nMen stopped being able to physically keep women in check and so the balance of power has shifted dramatically because women keep men in check verbally/emotionally/mentally which is still allowed.\n\nWant to berate your husband at work in front of his boss? No problem. Try to physically remove your wife when she does this? Welcome to jail. We outlawed the ways men interact and left intact all the ways women interact. Now we wonder why women are increasingly obtaining more power and status than men.\n\nMy advice? Next time a woman verbally assaults you tell her you think she would make a horrible mother/matriarch and leave her on the spot. Just like Afghanistan has deplorable things happening because of the unbalanced power between matriarchy and patriarchy so do countries like America or Sweden.\n\nBehind every horrible bitch of a woman is a weak willed man who is enabling her. Unfortunately in countries like America that weak willed man is what we call the \"patriarchy\" of congress, the president, etc so the individual man who tries to be strong will be brutally and coldly cast aside at best.",

I haven't linked to an MRM site or to Jezebel to assert my opinions of feminism so don't strawman. Your argument is that real feminists don't use patriarchy theory. That's not what they call it true, but patriarchy is a key point in feminist theory and MRAs have somewhat successfully rebranded it. This does not change the fact that patriarchy as a conceptual theory is used more than gender performativity in REAL LIFE.",

I mean, to get an idea of how *not* used the phrase is, consider using google scholar:\n\n* [\"patriarchy theory\"](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22patriarchy+theory%22&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C33&as_ylo=1993&as_yhi=2013) --- About 209 results from the past 20 years\n\n* [\"gender performativity\"](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0,33&as_ylo=1993&as_yhi=2013&q=%22gender+performativity%22) --- About 3,130 results from the past 20 years\n\n\"Gender performativity\" an relatively new and less \"know\" term has almost 15 times as many results.

Simply put, \"patriarchy\" is not \"a theory that unequivocally holds that, in blanket terms, men rule over women and are thus a problem.\"\n\nWhat *patriarchy* is is a description of the current order of gender inequality. Now, the etymology of the word does elicit it's original meaning of \"A social system in which the father is head of the household, having authority over women and children.\" However, feminists have given patriarchy an different meaning within feminist theory, which varies between the different varieties of feminism.\n\nIt is very untrue that all (or even most) feminist theories argue that \"in blanket terms, men rule over women.\" Some feminist theories argue that masculinity (in both men and women) is privileged over femininity. Other theories argue that dominant social positions in society are intimately connected to intersections along different axis of oppression. And this is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of diversity among feminist theories. Suffice it to say... it doesn't seem like all feminists (or even most) are like how you describe.",

Incontrovertible statistics that nobody contests, not even feminists, are magically cherry picked.\n\nLet me explain something to people not from this subreddit. [NAFALT](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQWoNhrY_fM) is [not](http://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/not-all-feminists-are-like-that-3/) a cogent defense. An institution and ideology in which patriarchy theory is the base dogma, a theory that unequivocally holds that, in blanket terms, men rule over women and are thus a problem, cannot be rational, much less have the overwhelming majority of it's adherents be rational, as MexicanGolf so unflinchingly states. Some who call themselves feminists may not believe in its base dogma and may be rational if not for the very fact they still, for whatever reason, decided to associate with an ideology that does.\n\nBeyond this, the highest level of feminist activism (the ones who are essentially the face of the movement) have directly contributed to actual bogus research, a whole lot worse than cherry picking, like the [1 in 4](http://www.iwf.org/news/2432517/One-in-Four-Rape-myths-do-injustice-too) rape [myth](http://www.city-journal.org/2008/18_1_campus_rape.html) while [completely erasing woman on man rapes](http://www.avoiceformen.com/mens-rights/ill-decide-if-you-were-raped-not-you/) which has directly negatively impacted men and boys, not to mention just peddling a whole narrative of man-bad woman-good that has led to everything from extreme bias against fathers in family courts and sentencing AND conviction disparities between men and women in criminal courts that makes the racial disparity seem trivial.\n\nYes, feminism has caused and/or exacerbated all of these.\n\nMany of you tried to shamefully redefine language regarding the \"cherry picked statistics\" I mentioned earlier by saying \"yeah well men and women both have privilege so the infographic doesn't negate the concept.\"\n \nHuh? Privilege as used by feminists is a zero-sum game. Only men can have privilege and only women can be oppressed. Sounds pretty black and white? Well there you go. Rational indeed.",

In order for the dictionary definition of equality to be accurate, men's equality movement and women's equality movement is the same thing. To simplify it, you could just call it the gender equality movement, because that actually makes sense.\n\nIs like this: I don't really care what label a person gives themselves, all I care about is their agenda, my agenda is 100% equal rights, laws and punishments for all genders and races. Some people develop an illness, some people are completely healthy, some people get struck by lightning, some people don't, some people win the lottery, some don't, that's all down to random chance, and it isn't racist or sexist, what isn't down to chance, is unequal punishment policy and different rights for gender, that's a mechanical problem caused by evil dictatorial people, that can be solved by good people via democracy. That can all be fully equalised overnight and should be and will be if enough people demand it using a democracy system.\n\nThe only thing that I think is correct to have gender and race quotas on, is nuclear weapons (if nuclear weapons are going to continue to exist) and military equipment. Men should have 50% of the nukes and military equipment, women should have the other 50% of nukes and military equipment, and the nukes and military equipment should also be shared out equally between the races, this is to avoid things like racist concentration camps and confederate slavery, because in my opinion racist and sexist policy is unlikely to occur, if there is diversity / equality in nuclear armed people and diversity / equality in people with powerful military equipment. There shouldn't be gender or race quotas in anything else in my opinion.\n\nAnyone who agrees with me I consider an ally in the gender equality movement, regardless of wether they call themselves a feminist or an MRA, or just call themselves an equality activist.",

Feminism is simply not a real and/or genuine field of study. It's a (childish) \"theory\" at best & should be treated as such.\n\nIn regards to \"women's rights\", that's a matter of law. Are there any rights men have that women do not? Quite simply: no (beyond SOME states/countries not allowing women to go topless in public, which I find quite a trivial & futile \"right\" to complain about, as women clearly don't even use the right even when it's granted to them). Are there rights women have that men do not? Yes. Men do not have the same (if any) reproductive rights & parental rights. We do not have the right to genital integrity (anywhere in the world). We do not have the right to complete bodily autonomy considering men have to sign away their lives under the draft. Failing to do so comes with heavy prices.\n\nI am completely open the the idea that there are genuine women's ISSUES... but to this day, NOT ONE feminist has been able to give me one example, except for those that are the result of biology (women paying the price for childbirth, struggling to balance career/family, etc) or aren't whatsoever \"gendered\" in nature (domestic violence for example). Beyond that we get silly nonsense that we know to be objectively false like the \"wage gap\" or \"rape culture\".\n\nAgain, I'm fairly certain you could name legitimate female issues but simply alluring to some mystical \"patriarchy\" & the boogeyman \"toxic masculinity\" isn't what I count as a genuine argument.\n\nAs far as \"equality\" goes, obviously equality of opportunity is what is best for society. Equality of outcome is a joke & deeply radical at its core. It's also completely antithetical to the value of \"diversity\".",

              "body": ">Do we believe that we live in a patriarchy, if yes and if not why?\n\nNo.  As far as I can tell \"patriarchy\" is too loosely defined and can mean whatever you want it to mean as long as it's telling about men in power or privileging men at the cost of women.  No, what we live in is just a society.  There are no perfect societies, and women will face similar issues no matter what based on being the mother regardless if there is a dad in the picture or not.\n\n>Do we believe that we have more problems than women so no need to care for them?\n\nThe common feminist view that men's problems don't count because women's have more problems; is not a good outlook.  It's not a competition and the person who has more complaints wins.  I've been told I have a sexist  and patriarchal view because I see the need for women to be protected.  But honestly I would be flattered if more women had a similar view towards men, that men shouldn't be thrown to the dogs but supported in some way or another.  I mean that's how I feel about women.  Not just that they have weaknesses to protect or some kind of view to look down on them.  But just that if I want the best for them and care about them, then protecting them from dangers known is a big deal.  Again, I'd like more women to have a similar view towards men to support them instead of trying to make it a competition.\n\n>Do we view equality as equality of outcome, opportunity, rights and responsibilities or equality of earnings?\n\nCall me controversial, but equality shouldn't be the main goal.  But being reasonable and fair to women as a whole, as well as reasonable and fair to men as a whole.  There are enough differences between the two that holding them to the same standards and calling it equality is just a way to either favor one over the other, or to make both sexes fall because the standards don't fit either one fully.  That said, being fair usually also overlaps in everything desired when it comes to equality.  Same pay for the same job type of thing.",

Some times its that society is created by men to benefit men, sometimes its dominated by men, sometimes is gender roles, etc etc.\n\nBut ultimately no, it largely boils down to apex fallacy. Lets simplify and say that 9 out 10 of country leaders are men. Feminists will say \"See? Men are 9 times as likely as women to be world leaders! Patriarchy! Men are in power!\" But, the word here they use are men, as if its the deciding factor and aplicable to men in general. Lets see how it stacks up in reality for your average man or woman. There is 195 countries but lets simplify and round it to 200 countries in the world. So with the ratio we invented (which I believe is actually close to accurate) that is 20 women and 180 men. 1 to 9. But what is the difference for the average person?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo 180 out of 4 billion is 0.000045% of the male population.\n\nAnd 20 out of 4 billion is 0.000005% of the female population.\n\nMeaning the difference in percentage point between the genders of any given person being a world leader is 0.00004%. That is so incredibly tiny yet feminists insist that is generally applicable and accurately describe all gender dynamics trough history. Yet the vast majority of homeless are male and constitute millions of people, a vastly more likely fate, is completely irrelevant and speaks nothing to gender dynamics. See the double standard?",

It's weird how we definitely can't ever meaningfully tax the upper class and largest businesses at all.\n\nCould we at least agree that universal single payer healthcare is worth doing?  We already pay for healthcare for poor people and retired people and health insurance benefits heavily from economies of scale so a single risk pool containing everyone is going to have the power to negotiate better prices than any existing health insurance company. It also allows for simplifying the bureaucracy somewhat as there would no longer be a need to maintain multiple subsidized health insurance systems (medicare, medicaid, chip, healthcare cards for foster kids) the interactions between which have their own layer of bureaucracy (for example, Medicare does not include outpatient prescription drug coverage unless one pays for a separate part d plan, unless one also qualifies for Medicaid in which case Medicaid pays for the part d plan and other gaps in Medicare coverage).",

It is not hierarchical, it's not meant to be. It is an analysis in how your varying identities interact with each other in the eyes of self, others, and society.\n\nUnfortunately victim centered people tend to misunderstand how identity works within it.\n\nI'll use Intersectionality in the context of Men's issues. Black Men and Black Women experience racism very differently. Anti-Black Male rhetoric is caked with androphobic ideas of us being violent, criminal, and sexually aggressive. For this reason Anti-Black Racism tends to be more overtly violent against Men than Women.\n\nAnother example. Homosexual and Bisexual Men are generally assumed to be more readily accepted by society when they assimilate into masculinity. This is complicated and leans on untrue. Feminine Gay Men are treated differently, but not better nor worse. Feminine Gay Men tend to be seen as inferior men and people view them as weak. They are also not seen as physical threats unlike Masculine Gay Men who are treated as predators (a common Androphobic trope) and as self hating simply for not fitting into the \"correct\" box.\n\nIntersectionality isn't designed to pit us against one another. It does however undermine the idea of a universal manhood or universal womanhood that is prevalent in MRA and Feminist circles. I am a Black Gay Man, my experience is very different from many in this subreddit and I tend to experience androphobia and misandry very differently. More often then not the androphobia I experience is inseparable from my ethnic and sexual identity.",

So men are pushed to get higher paying jobs, and once they\u2019re in the jobs, to work hard and stand out to get promoted and raises.

No it isn't as large as the 20% gap often cited, it's usually around 5%, but that's still significant.\n\nFor example, Glassdoor has produced two studies, one in 2016 ([Demystifying the Gender Pay Gap: Evidence from Glassdoor Salary Data](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/gender-pay-gap/)) and another in 2019 ([Progress on the Gender Pay Gap](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/gender-pay-gap-2019/)). They both controlled for the variables, they weren't just averages of all of men's and women's earnings, and they found about a 5% adjusted wage gap.\n\nAlso consider a study from the AAUW called [Graduating to a Pay Gap](https://ww3.aauw.org/research/graduating-to-a-pay-gap/). This study first looked at men and women in the same major one year after graduation, but also controlled for other relevant variables. Even after controlling for all these factors, it still finds about a 7% adjusted wage gap that cannot be explained by things like college major, type of\rinstitution, hours worked, or economic sector.\n\nFurthermore, [The Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jel.20160995), by Blau and Kahn is a detailed study that also found a persistent 8% gap even after controlling for things like hours, education, experience, race, religion, metro residence, industry, occupation, and collective bargaining.\n\nAnti-feminists like to act like controlling for all the variables makes the wage gap disappear, but it doesn't and research proves it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay so all of that was BS. In the last post I made I explained how these and other commonly cited studies are methodologically flawed and why they do not support the conclusions typically drawn from them. When I first read some of these studies, it initially made me pause and think that I may have been incorrect about the wage gap and that it might be real, but a little more close reading proved that to not be the case.

              "body": "The Gender Pay Gap is a deficit in average female lifetime earnings, arising solely through their preference for less physically and mentally demanding, less stressful employment, often part-time after having children.... a female **choice** which is usually denied the male after those children arrive. It's illegal to pay a woman less for the same work, and has been since the Equal Pay Act. So - how do they intend to 'close' this gap? By paying themselves more than men, and making women even more equal? It's nuts. Knock the ball back into **their** court, ask how **they** would address the (non) issue of the 'Gender Pay Gap'. If it's going to be all about making it even easier for women to earn more than men, there will, eventually be repercussions. When women earn more than men, it weakens men's contribution to the community, and promotes more anti-social ways of confirming masculinity. A man's money is comparatively social affirmative, more likely to be spent on a family than on Gucci accessories.\n\nWomen are happy to make equal pay for equal work, so how about equal social responsibility? If women were really into this 'equality' they are always trumpeting about, every man would have an equal chance when he tried to chat up a woman in the supermodel bracket. Why should we have to do all the chasing in the first place, leaving ourselves open to sexual harassment charges if we don't have the bone structure of Brad Pitt and the wallet of Bill Gates? How about they use some of that equal pay, dig deep into the Chanel handbag and buy us a drink, ask us about our day? Not gonna happen, is it? Instead, every quota hiring of a woman has the potential to deny a man a job, making it more difficult for that man to attract a woman, have a relationship and maybe start a family. But, we all know how that mostly ends these days, anyway.\n\nWhether we like it or not, a job forms a central part of the sexual constitution. Historically, it confirmed the masculine identity of the main earner, and it's vital to understand the sexual role of money. Any attempts to redress a (non-existent) Gender Pay Gap are simply means to keep the price of sex high, and to castrate men even more than has already been achieved. And the sum total of those achievements in the female sphere? It's now *sooo* difficult to attract the right man, and the empowered girls can look forward to a future of wine boxes, cat litter, and box sets of 'Friends'. The one where they blew it.",

I imagine fewer men would get mangled in logging accidents if technology and policies could be implemented to make the job less physically demanding.  They would also do less damage to their bodies; even if they're not maimed in an accident, blue-collar workers often end up with crippling chronic pain issues from working long, hard hours.  So making these jobs less physically demanding would enable women to do them *AND* benefit men as well.\n\nTo be clear, I don't believe the first paragraph, just playing devil's advocate.

By implication, any critical theory \u2014 be it critical race, feminist, liberationist, or Marxist theory \u2014 that articulates gender, class, or race difference as a primary and originary difference masks the complex interstructuring of kyriarchal dominations inscribed in the subject positions of individual wo/men and in the status positions of dominance and subordination between wo/men. It also masks the participation of white elite wo/men, or better \"ladies,\" and of Christian religion in kyriarchal oppression, insofar as both have served as civilizing colonialist conduits of kyriarchal knowledges, values, and culture.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy",

Those words are; the advantaged and the disadvantaged.\n\nThe warped definition and nonsensical theories feminists attached to the word patriarchy and the creation of the word kyriarchy were made for only one purpose; to put one group of people against another.\n\nFeminists have to fabricate a male dominated patriarchal society where women are oppressed.\n\nWith this fabrication, women are led to believe, through college education no less, that they are oppressed and men are the reason why.\n\nBut all good lies are built on a sliver of truth. There are women who are disadvantaged. Some people took a look at this and ignored the other half of the human race. That is how the feminist patriarchy theory was created.\n\nAll humans are advantaged and disadvantaged in one way or another and when you try to measure out who is more advantaged than the other then things like the gender war start.\n\nNo sensible person can say that any man anywhere is more advantaged than all women, so feminists just grouped all men together. And since that isn't working anymore they are just shifting the groups around while still managing to keep men on top, effectively maintaining men's status as a target for their blame.\n\nIf people who are against feminism start going down the same path as feminists, needing new words and theories to identify their position and beliefs then they will become just as fucked up as feminists.\n\nThe only word I need when directing my blame for the discrimination men face is feminism. I didn't create it, I didn't make up any of the theories that describe it, and it isn't a person I can claim has too much of an advantage over me and therefore needs to be legally disadvantaged in order for me to succeed in life.\n\nIt is an ideology and ideologies, unlike people, can be sensibly blamed for the suffering of a mass group of people. Especially when the evils of that ideology can be pointed out clearly, with no need for the attachment of fabricated theories to make them look bad.\n\nLine of thinking in accordance with feminism: The importance and order in which the issues of humanity will be sorted out in accordance with identified levels of privilege is as follows; Women of color first (black, asian, indian, hispanic, etc), white women next, then men of color, and then finally white men.\n\nThe fucking insanity of a line of thinking like that is sadly not recognized by the majority of humanity.\n\nWe don't live in a patriarchy or kyriarchy or any of that crap. We live in the world. Or at least that's where I live.",

They are not independent--they need subsidies and government funded education, and government funded daycare and health care, and a billion other entitlements that essentially make a single woman with children take tons more out of the system than she puts in.\n\nWomen are no more independent than they were 200 years ago. They've just inserted a middle man between themselves and men--and rather than a fair and equitable bargain between two people, men's obligation to women is extracted forcibly by the state, without any corresponding benefit or choice, either through court-ordered payments of child support and alimony, or through taxes.\n\nThe more \"independent\" from individual men women become, the bigger and more coercive the mechanism needs to be to extract money, power and resources from men and hand them over to women.\n\nGovernments love it, because as long as they hand out cookies to their majority demographic (seriously, the top issue right now is that women don't want to pay their own $10/month for birth control pills!), they have an excuse to keep expanding, and that majority demographic and other well-meaning dupes will keep voting to make things bigger and bigger. Corporations love it because women drive ~80% of consumer spending, so the more money you shove into women's hands, the more money goes into corporate coffers. AND, because the breakdown of marriage has increased competition for jobs, corporations have more power to negotiate wages downward and behave in socially irresponsible ways. \n\nWomen could be free and independent without causing this expanding bubble, but they'd have to embrace some accountability/responsibility for their unilateral choices--that means dealing with a decrease in their standard of living if they divorce or have a child out of wedlock. Feminism does not want that for women--I've heard feminists state that giving a man an option to opt out of fatherhood (financial abortion) would *force* women to make choices they wouldn't otherwise make. In other words, women wouldn't be able to have what they want unless they were willing to carry the cost themselves.\n\nWhat feminism has essentially done is free women from any and all obligation, and in order to do so, they've had to offload that obligation onto men. And because they don't want women to have to offer men commensurate benefit, they need a big government to steal the capital required from men.\n\nI don't know a single feminist who is a libertarian.

It is almost always used a societal grand narrative that ignores context and puts 'are you a woman?' at the top(bottom) of the totem pole. To those whom the term is most relevant, all societal oppression is linked to femininity, or more specifically, deviation from the norm that is masculinity. It is just a more thorough grand narrative that is 'patriarchy'. This leads to mental gymnastics like:\n\nHomophobia? Well, that's just because women are viewed as weak, and society does not like gay men because they are viewed closer to women.\n\nRacism? Well, all racism stems from the dislike of that race's women and how they don't conform to the hetero-Caucasoid notion of what is 'proper' for a woman to look like and act, thus resulting in the othering of their men.\n\nAgeism? Masculinity imposes its standards upon society, and children are on the level of women in its eyes. \n\n\nYou get the idea. This is why institutionalized feminism has co-opted pretty much every goddamn civil rights movement in the history of the west.",

However it gets us little further along as we still are posed with the questions of what is Equality? and how much do we really want?\n\nI would question whether 'Complete Equality' is actually definable or possibly can even exist, it could be a 4 legged tripod. Even if it does exist what else must be sacrificed to achieve it, Sir Thomas Moore's Utopia illustrates that striving for Utopia results in Distopia.\n\nAnd perhaps the biggest elephant in the room is:- who is oppressed and who is not? and how do you define oppression anyway? There will probably be a few arguments over that and it's where the meat of all this gender crap really is anyway.\n\nSo the questions I ask of you are:- What is Complete Equality, can it exist and if it does what are we sacrificing to achieve it?

It is not a cultural moral universal, the Greeks thought little of it and neither did most of Europe till the very latter stages of the Industrial Revolution. Historically most civilizations have willingly bartered away equality for other concerns. \n\nStar Trek addresses this very issue with its different societies having different imperatives, Clingon = Honor, Ferengi= Business, Vulcan = Logic, Alliance = Liberalism. And of course let us not forget Religion.  Unfortunately cultures tend not to be able to see that their imperative is not the only valid one. In essence I am arguing for an element of moral relativism here.\n\n(3) \"Simple bases for large social change that fit on the back of an envelope, let alone one word, bother me. eg Pol Pot\"\n\nMost simply stated ideas for social re-organisation and change superficially seem attractive but fail to account for the complexities of the human condition,  most of which we don't fully understand. eg Communism, Pol Pot, imposing Democracy on 3rd world Countries. On a smaller scale:- Prohibition, War on Drugs, Kibbutz Movement.  \n\n",

How can you have authority to enforce laws (which is what police do) when there is no authority?\r\n\r\nFirst the concept of non-oppressive police is my own version of anarchist principles.  You just start by imaging there are 2 or more of you that want to hire me as the police officer.  What powers and responsibilities do you want to allow me.  You can probably agree that the goal is only to arrest \"bad guys\"/thiefs.  You want to allow anyone the right to video my actions, and treat police abuse as just as serious a crime as any other (somalis make authority figures pay double penalty for their crimes).  Punish thieves and punish punishers of non thieves seems like a fair non-oppressive system if the privilege is granted (revokable) by the policed.  \r\n\r\nThe big difference with our police systems being that they are insular serving mayors/regional/national politics, and merely projecting a pretense of accountability and responsibility.  They serve fascist fucks that cowtow to feminist terror propaganda of rape and DV culture and pro arrest policies.\r\n\r\n> You either dont understand the word authority or dont understand the word anarchy\r\n\r\nNo we don't share understanding of those concepts.

Fact is, if we didn't have a tendency to become greedy or corrupt as humans (generally), then communism would work really well. If no humans where prone to violence, then anarchy would work great. Heck, if it wasn't for our own flaws even the shittiest form of gov we can think of today would probably work just fine. \n\nEdit: I know this is off topic, but this is just the sort of informed, civil discussion that is sadly lacking over on /r/anarchism.

Let's play out your \"equal authority\" (whatever that means, isn't authority an imbalance of power by definition?) fantasy and see where it leads us. How would this voting process go? Who would collect and count these votes? How would these people be paid? Since everyone is voting, isn't everyone responsible for paying the vote talliers? That means taxes. But what if I don't want to pay taxes? Who will make me? And suddenly we have police, a clear imbalance of power. What you're talking about doesn't exist already because it is impossible, at least on a large scale. Do you think you're the first person to want equality of power? People have tried throughout history to form perfect societies but it doesn't work, and I'll tell you why. Because people are lazy and greedy and eventually, someone won't carry their share. ",

A \"anarcho-masculinism\" star would serve no purpose. The problem though with feminism is that the term itself is misleading. It is supposed to simply mean gender equality, but some people (both people looking in, and self described \"feminists\") take it to mean women having more rights than men.

Because /r/anarchism has no real interest in Anarchism and all they want to do is \"rebel\" like angsty teenager against the \"oppressive whites and males\". I think true Anarchists got over the ideas of races and sex being barriers from people to become self-sufficient individuals but no, they still have to fight battles that have been fought decades ago. But that's not my point.\n/r/anarchism has been using [this logo](http://thumbs.reddit.com/t5_2qh5j.png?v=18a6f7959763f387c64088e25955b7e7) for a lot of time and the mods (who now disappeared) refuse to take it down. I don't think I need to comment about how offensive that logo is.\nThen, [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/dcw01/honest_question_what_does_feminism_lgbt_rights/) popped up. An user sincerely asked what feminism, LGBT-rights and anti-racism have to do with Anarchism, which is the natural rejection of all discriminations. Look at the answers and notice how the OP didn't ask about gender equality but asked about Feminism and, instead, he got answers about \"equality\". Someone went as far as saying that *Feminism parallels anarchism very directly, although its critique of power focuses on the patriarchy, rather than the state*. \nThen, let's get back to the subreddit as a whole. They have a star system for differents kinds of Anarchism; pink-black for \"anarcho-feminism\" and purple-black for \"queer anarchism\", but no stars for \"anarcho-masculinism\". Because it makes sense, right?\nAnd every time I questioned /r/Anarchism one-sidedness, I got answers like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/dbpnk/people_who_said_nigger_today/c0z2nd3?context=3) or [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/dbpnk/people_who_said_nigger_today/c0z2ufq?context=3). \nThe people at /r/anarchism have never taken the philosophy they're pretending to champion seriously and I just wanted to warn other males that care about the issues of their peers that /r/anarchism is extremely misandrist and that they do not represent the opinion of all anarchists, just an unimportant part of privileged people that pretend to be anarchists because they have no idea of real social or racial struggle and only experience it through sit-coms. \nFor reference: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/cy8fz/anarchism_is_explicitly_feminist_and_for_a_while/) (notice how they decide on their own that Anarchism is explicitly feminist)",

You (not just you specifically, feminists in general) look at the world and declare by fiat that women are oppressed and it's all men's fault and call it 'Patriarchy'.\n\nThe death gap, the sentencing gap, the absence of support for male victims of DV, the lack of concern for boys murdered by Boko Haram, the lack of concern for targeted [gendercide](http://www.gendercide.org/) around the world, are all evidence that society does NOT privilege men.\n\n>I think it's wrong to equate male circumcision with FGM. One is mainly an aesthetic difference, the other is \"sex will only be painful forever\". I think they're both wrong, but one is more damaging and that's why it gets the increased attention. Rightfully so, really.\n\nOh my fucking god. How do you look at yourself in the mirror?\n\nOK, let's unpack this.\n\nFirstly, if you actually care about young girls being mutilated you'll want to stop it. Do you know one of the biggest problems the West has in convincing 'natives' to stop FGM?\n\nIt's those damn 'natives' and their inability to accept the West's double standards. They keep wondering why we keep telling them to stop one but raise no issues about the other.\n\nSecondly, FGM includes [a range of practices](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/) from complete clitoridectomy down to a purely symbolic pinprick.\n\nBut somehow, again by fiat, a pinprick is worse than cutting away skin. Skin, I might add, that is NOT useless. So why is Type 4 FGM worse than MGM? Because it's happening to a vagina. That is the ONLY reason.\n\nBefore you come back with other trite talking points we've heard a thousand times before:\n\n1. \"FGM is performed in unsanitary conditions\" Would you accept FGM performed in a modern hospital? Of course not. Places that cut girls in conditions like that ALSO cut boys in those same filthy conditions.\n\n1. \"Girls die from complications\" FFS, so do boys: https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/6m2jrt/11_dead_from_botched_circumcisions_in_south_africa/ How many dead boys will it take for you to agree to ban this barbarism? It's more than 11, obviously. How many more exactly? How many kids in NY need to get Herpes? 20? 50? 100s? Is there actually a point at which you'll stop virtue signalling (because, honey, FGM is already [illegal in the West](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/664dep/detroit_doctor_charged_with_female_genital/)) and actually support the human rights of infants despite them having penis?\n\n1. \"It reduces STDs\" Debatable. Anyway, infants aren't sexually ~~attractive~~ ACTIVE. They can wait until they are, and make an informed choice for themselves.\n\n1. \"It's better looking\" Feminists go apeshit over girls 'having' to shave their pussies, yet are OK with routine cosmetic surgery on boys. Can you not see the hypocrisy?\n\n1. \"You're anti-semitic (or Islamaphobic)\" You don't care about religious belief when banning FGM. The parent's faith ONLY overrides a child's right to bodily integrity when it's a boy (again, evidence against Patriarchy)\n\n1. \"It's done to control women's sexuality\" Circumcision was popularised in the West as a way to stop masturbation, ie control MALE sexuality. But that's OK because male sexuality is 'toxic' amirite?\n\n1. \"FGM reduces a woman's sexual pleasure\" It's the same body part, so how does removing it from a boy NOT affect his sexual response?\n\n1. \"Don't you want to look like your father?\" or other peer-pressure. Really? MGM is OK due to an [Appeal to tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition)? So traditions that harm women == bad? But traditions that harm men == good? Why is that? I thought feminists were into equality before the law and overturning old, sexist ways?\n\nPlus, and I would like to make this very clear you are trying to parse which children it is acceptable to mutilate, based on their gender.\n\nAnd it is mutilation. Routine infant male circumcision is medically unnecessary. There are a few conditions that require it, but very few, and we aren't discussing phimosis or anything like it.\n\nWe are discussing taking a perfectly healthy baby boy, strapping him to a board and cutting his genitals WITHOUT ANESTHESIA with no medical necessity.\n\nNobody on this sub is going to argue in support of FGM, but here you are arguing FOR genital mutilation of boys. You (and feminists like you) are arguing against a simple premise:\n\n>\"Routine circumcision of boys is a medically unnecessary surgical procedure and therefore, by definition, mutilation and should be banned.\"\n\nSo you've answered your own question. Why don't MRAs work together with feminists? It's because we're not willing to sacrifice infants to our ideology.\n\n[edited] to add a link and change a typo.",

[The clitoral hood develops into the foreskin in male fetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitoral_hood). So FGM Type I a for a girl is what circumcision is for a boy. It is the same bodypart on different genders. The medical term for female mutilation type 1 a is literally \"circumcision\" too, where as the more severe forms of female genital mutilation, which are more common, have different names. The only difference here, one is illegal, the other is tradition. Some forms of FGM are way less destructive than male circumcision like a \"ritual pinprick\"; all of which are still illegal.\n\nDespite that, cutting female and male genitals have the following similarities:\n\n - Over 100 million procedures have been performed on current populations.\n - It's unnecessary and extremely painful.\n - It can have adverse sexual and psychol. effects.\n - It's generally done by force on children.\n - It is generally supported by local medical doctors.\n - Pertinent biological facts are not generally known where procedures are practiced.\n - It is defended with reasons such as tradition, religion, aesthetics, cleanliness, and health.\n - The rationale has currently or historically been connected to controlling sexual pleasure.\n - It's often believed there's no effect on normal sexual functioning.\n - It's generally accepted and supported by those who have been subjected to it.\n - Those who are cut feel compelled to cut their children.\n - The choice may be motivated by underlying psychosexual reasons.\n - Critical public discussion is generally taboo where the procedure is practiced.\n - It can result in serious complications that can lead to death.\n - The adverse effects are hidden by repression and denial.\n - Dozens of potentially harmful physiological, emotional, behavioral, sexual, and social effects on individuals and societies have never been studied.\n - Where female genital cutting is practiced, cutting the genitals of males is often practiced.\n - On a qualitative level, cutting the genitals of male and female children are one and the same thing.\n - To allow us to develop into our maximum individual and social potential, we must stop the cutting of genitals of both sexes.",

All the examples you gave there, including men dying all the time, are largely caused by patriarchy. \"Men are strong, men lead, men go die for country\". I don't think it's that they're considered disposable, just that they're expected to take those risks and are more willing to take them in order to live up to those expectations.\n\nSame thing that makes people go apeshit when a girl goes missing rather than a boy. Girls are thought to be weaker and more innocent. It all grows from the same root.\n\nI think it's wrong to equate male circumcision with FGM. One is mainly an aesthetic difference, the other is \"sex will only be painful forever\". I think they're both wrong, but one is more damaging and that's why it gets the increased attention.

              "body": "The dictionary definition of feminism, that we see repeated *ad nauseum* here is, \"the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes.\" Were that the case then, yes, we would be on the same side.\n\nEXCEPT that definition is, at best, superficial and, at worst, deliberate misrepresentation of the ideology.\n\nOne thing you cannot avoid is Patriarchy Theory. That is at the core of feminism.\n\n>In Shaw & Lee\u2019s (2012) textbook, Women\u2019s Voices: Feminist Visions (5th edition), they define patriarchy as a \u201csocial (political, economic, religious, cultural) system where men have power over women (pg. 5).\u201d\n\n*from https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/gender-and-schooling/201612/patriarchy-101*\n\nThis relies on several flawed assumptions:\n\n1. there is an oppressor/oppressed dynamic in society based on sex\n\n1. Women are the oppressed sex and men are the oppressors\n\nFeminists will point to frex historical wage inequality, or different legal rights and responsibilities as evidence for the theory when, in fact, this differences are what the theory is trying to explain. It's circular reasoning.\n\nThe biggest assumption of the theory is that society is arranged in such a way that all women are oppressed and all men are privileged. That's blatantly not the case.\n\nMen make up:\n\n99% of combat deaths\n\n95% workplace deaths\n\n80% of suicides\n\n75% of the homeless\n\n66% victims of violence\n\n50% victims of DV\n\nWith FEW exceptions (Iran, Israel, some Nordic countries) men AND ONLY men are subject to mandatory military service. In the US today, men under the age of 26 have to register for selective service. Failure is a felony.\n\nWhich brings us to the point that men receive 60% longer prison sentences than women for the same crime, are more likely to face more serious charges than a woman for the same criminal act, more likely to be arrested.\n\nThe fact is that men are considered disposable.\n\nDo you remember when Boko Haram kidnapped a bunch of girls and the world went apeshit? What happened to the boys? The were killed and nobody cared.\n\nFemale circumcision was banned as soon as we, in the West, heard about it yet boys are still cut today. We call it FGM, we say calling it \"female circumcision\" is minimising it but the boys? Fuck 'em.\n\nThis is hardly evidence for male privilege.\n\nIn the absolute sense of wanting equal rights before the law, then yes we are in agreement.\n\nBut I can't agree with a movement that is based on such fundamental flaws in its reasoning.\n\nThis wouldn't be such a problem, except feminists actively denigrate men's actions to raise awareness about this. They didn't create male disposability, but they are doing their damnedest to keep it going.",

I was treated exceptionally different because of my gender. It was brutal to be treated so unequally simply because of how I was born. Feminism was billed as the movement to change that, and I was ready to jump in with both feet. \n\nThen I looked into it I discovered that feminism was the direct cause of all the policies that affected me negatively. There are feminists orgs that oppose every effort at equal parenting, and feminists that treat DV as an entirely gendered issue. In both instances they've been able to affect public policy at a state and national level. These weren't vestiges of traditional gender roles, but actively lobbied for and defended by people who claimed the banner of 'equality'. We can't challenge the rules which affect us, without challenging the ideology that supports it. \n\nLike many MRAs I never set out to be anti-feminist. I simply want equal rights for fathers, and male DV victims. If that earns me the label 'anti-feminist', then I can live with that label. The answer is, yes we should be on the same side, but why we aren't has more to do with Feminism excluding men's issues than anything else. There are many feminists which MRAs agree/ally with. CH Sommers, and Erin Pizzey are great examples. Warren Farrell is another. He was on the board of NOW, and has been trying to build a bridge between feminism and the MRM for decades. If that is the kind of feminism that you support, then we are already on the same side.  ",

That's delusional self deception.\nListen, if you want to call yourself a feminist, I don't care. I've been investigating feminism for more than 9 years now, and people like you used to piss me off, because to my mind all you were doing was providing cover and ballast for the powerful political and academic feminists you claim are just jerks.

You don't matter. You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: \"Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,\" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, \"we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.\"\n\n>You're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.\n\n>You're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were \"ambivalent about their sexual desires\" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.\nYou're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.\nYou're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.\n\n>You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.\n\n>You're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.\n\n>You're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.\nYou're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's \"part of her sexual history.\"\n\n>You're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is \"not a crime\" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a \"legal\" way to rape them.\n\n>And you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.\n\n>You're the true feminist.

(Christians are all 'love your neighbor' until they find out he's fucking another dude). Modern institutional (often academic) feminism, at this point, isn't really about creating useful change in areas it is most needed. It's about generating catharsis for upper middle class college educated (mostly white) women.  That's why we see the current hysteria over sexual assaults on college campuses (statistically one of the safer places for a woman to be) and relative silence about the vastly higher rates of sexual assault in low income high crime areas.\n\nSo yes, the people on this sub believe in gender equality (usually as in equality of opportunity, not inherently identical outcome).

I am holding-back the full extent of what I know for the sake of brevity.)\n\nEssentially, some members of a lacrosse team at Duke U were accused of raping an exotic dancer at a party. Without going into too much detail, the only reasonable thing you could conclude from the evidence was that the accuser was either lying, mentally unstable or high (or a mix of all three). One of the accused had a time-stamped photograph of him being on the other side of town, for instance, and the official police report said she'd claimed she'd been raped in \"mid air\" somehow. The town's District Attorney was up for reelection and had decided to push this case, come hell or high water. (The \"nurse\" who examined the accuser was also highly suspect. In fact, she was so suspect that the DA did not ask her to testify as a witness, despite the fact that her medical report was the only tangible item the prosecutor had as evidence. But I won't go into that here, even though it's highly relevant to what we are discussing. Feel free to ask if you'd like to know about that particular detail.)\n\nThe feminist reaction to the case, not only on the Duke campus but also in the media and online, was essentially to scream \"GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY\" non-stop for months. Because, in feminist ideology, an accused rapist *is guilty,* for the accusation is all the evidence which is necessary. Women do not, will not, *can not* fib about that single solitary thing, end of story, period. This is an unshakable article of faith with them.\n\nAnd no matter what evidence that came in-- all of it pointing to the innocence of the accused, to the fact that the rape *did not take place* and to the mendacity of the accuser-- the feminist commentariat were baying for blood like a lynch-mob. The DNA evidence, they insisted, would vindicate the guilt of the accused and, when the DNA reports turned-up zilch, the feminists insisted that the DNA didn't matter after all. And so on.\n\nEvery reasonable step that the accused did in their own defense was interpreted, by the feminists, as a further sign of them being guilty as hell. They wore ties to their deposition? The bastards! They cooperated with the police? The bastards! They didn't contradict each other in their testimonies? The bastards! Etc.\n\nFeminist commentators asserted the fact that they had hired a stripper was a damning indictment of the lacrosse players' characters (they are not angels so we can't believe them!), but the fact that the accuser was a stripper was, naturally, irrelevant (she shouldn't have to be an angel to be believed!) and I didn't understand that: that *hiring* a stripper was a horrible act and shameful sin, but *being* a stripper who presumably wants to be hired was something we shouldn't judge.\n\nAfter months of this circus, the state of North Carolina had to step-in and the state attorney general declared the accused \"innocent\" (not \"not guilty\", *innocent*, which is a rare thing for a state AG to do) and, lickety-split, the feminist commentariat either went silent or turned their attention elsewhere. Most of the biggest offenders in the blogosphere never apologized and are currently able to submit op-eds to such outfits as the NY Times, CNN, Salon.com and Cosmopolitan magazine.\n\nAnd the woman who started it all? Crystal Gail Magnum? Naturally, she wasn't punished for wasting all that police time and lying to the court. And a few years later, [she fatally stabbed a black dude.](http://www.wral.com/mangum-found-guilty-in-boyfriend-s-stabbing-death/13143246/) This, the fragile, delicate, innocent buttercup who feminists spent a year defending.\n\nTheir performance was what I like to call: \"upside-down psycho-town.\" And today, they don't like to talk about that subject because it would simply embarrass all of the participants.",

From our POV, it often seems that self-described moderate feminists are quick to find fault with MRAs, while excusing bad behavior from feminists (saying, \"not all feminists\").\n\n> Every single one of the problems I listed above is caused by the patriarchy.\n\nTo quote Karen Straughan, you sound like, \"We're not blaming men; we just named everything bad after them.\"  Let's face it, \"patriarchy\" means men.  MRAs are not interested in a framework that starts from the premise that men are the problem.\n\nIt is very easy to find horrible, inexcusable things said by feminists in positions of power.  Here's a list(1).  How about Professor Sally Miller Gearhart, who published a feminist treatise that argued, \"The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately 10% of the human race.\"  That's considered fine and acceptable.  She still gets to be a professor.  Her editor and publisher okayed it, and it was widely read in gender-studies circles.\n\nYet when you read an anonymous poster on reddit saying something harsh about women, you think, \"these MRAs really need to tone it down.\"  Haha.  Our society has no problem with male bashing, but a crazy low pain threshold when it comes to bad stuff about females.\n\nWomen are very uncomfortable with the idea of men having frank conversations among themselves, to the point that the activity is taboo--except in a few places, such as this one.\n\nYou are welcome in this space, but don't expect to always be comfortable.\n\n(1) http://thoughtcatalog.com/jake-fillis/2014/05/23-quotes-from-feminists-that-will-make-you-rethink-feminism/",

Here's a talk by Anil Kumar on a men's rights topic there:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbWi6fjA3A0\n\nin which he mentions \"dowry fraud\".  So what's so important about that?  It's a transfer of money and property and apparently very important.  Not surprising, when you could lose (or gain) money.  The point is, I didn't know about that at all, certainly not how important is is in Indian society.  And you probably don't either.  Another thing that was a surprise to me was the power and influence of the parents; again, this is probably to do with inheritance and property transfers, but I'm really only guessing.  And this is where feminist argumentation comes in. Frankly, our ignorance in these matters lets unscrupulous arguers make stuff up and get away with it.  Similarly when they call on the situation in past history, too long ago to be in anyone's memory.  Again, they can, and do, get away with making stuff up.  Few have the time to do the research to check every detail, and I'm sure you can sympathize with that.\n\n",

STEM fields are weird. The countries with the most equal representation of women in STEM fields are Pakistan and Iran (both around 50%,  and not renowned for their records in gender equality), while the supposedly most gender neutral nations on the planet like Sweden and Denmark have single digit percentage female STEM participation by women.\n\nCould it be, that there are actual biological gender preferences, that come to the foreground when you maximise choice?\n\nCould it be, that social constructionist theory is wrong?",

If anything, we started to notice some trends in the opposite direction of what we expected: for technical ability, it appeared that men who were modulated to sound like women did a bit better than unmodulated men and that women who were modulated to sound like men did a bit worse than unmodulated women. Though these trends weren\u2019t statistically significant, I am mentioning them because they were unexpected and definitely something to watch for as we collect more data.",

It's interesting to note that a huge portion of prominent MRAs are women.  \n\nBut since this section on Apex Fallacy didn't seem to go anywhere, I'll pick it up.  You say you don't know how to run shit, so (presumably) you voted for people you felt did know *and* shared your values, correct?  I would also think it's safe to say that women who vote do the same as well.  So why does it matter if women vote for men?  Would you feel underrepresented by a female even if she shared your values just as much as any male politician you've voted for?  \n\nAs for why fewer women run for office, I think this reasoning applies.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awot-d8U9Cc",

Is there a law that that stops you from running for office? How many women have run for the office? Do you have any numbers on that? You can probably make a case if there are 100 women and 100 men running for the office and there are 90 men and 5 women elected. Even then, there is no case because women are free to vote and majority have voted for men.\n\nNow having seen how feminists shift the goal posts, let me move along with the changes too the goal posts. Feminists will say there is a society that is set up to discourage women from running for office. Alright, let me play along. What does this society consist of ? If it is your family and extended family and that doesn't support you for running office you have no chance. It just means you have failed in convincing the closest people into voting for you; Its so convenient to blame a made up patriarchal system (no one sees it, you can't put a finger on it  and you can take a comfort in shifting the blame without anthologizing anyone), or your own people or yourselves?\n\nYou realize how much effort, work, money, organizing, personal sacrifice it takes to run for office and decide that life is good spending time with children and family. And then when you have keyboard at your finger tips its quite easy to play *oh we are victims* game; running for office is hard.\n",

It's more useful to look at what causes men to be like that. Root causes everywhere.\n\n\"Most studies find that mothers or female carers are assailants in equal or greater proportion to fathers or father figures. When asked which parent or carer was responsible for the violence, Cawson et al. found 51% of female respondents identified their mothers or step-mothers and 47% identified their fathers or step-fathers. Forty eight percent of male respondents identified their mothers/step-mothers and 50% identified their fathers/step-fathers as responsible. Thus, in intra-familial child violence, females appear to be responsible for the violence and also victims in more or less equal numbers to males.\" \n\nhttp://www.socwork.net/sws/article/view/176/567\n\n-\n\n\"Parental infanticide researchers have found that mothers are far more likely than fathers to be the perpetrator for neonaticide[1] and slightly more likely to commit infanticide in general.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infanticide\n\n\nYou have been spoon fed lies!

The child protection agency here provides annual reports. The most dangerous type of family for a child to be in, is a single mother family. Has been for years. The reports are not hard to find, but you have to move past a lot of feminist inspired BS at the front before you get to the tables of raw data in the appendices to see that this is true.\n\nWomen are also twice as likely to kill their own children as their fathers, but they blame post partum depression and it's all ok somehow, but don't mention women and hormones. Not ok to talk about that apparently.\n\nRosie Batties husband kills their child and she becomes Australian of the Year and poster child for the DV initiative, but the woman up in Queensland that killed all 12 of her children is supposed to just vanish from public memory.\n\nThese patterns turn up in the USA and Britain also. Just look for the actual raw data. Analysis is frequently biased in the most extraordinary ways. \n\nSometimes even the data is corrupt. The DV surveys by what should be the most reliable and unbiased organization in the country (The Australian Bureau of Statistics) we're initially only based on interviews with women about their experience. In subsequent years, Parliament instructed them to investigate the male experience also, so they deliberately employed 100% female interviewers (having to get special permission by the anti discrimination commissioner), and then only interviewed half of the quantity of men they needed for a statistically significant result.\nEven then, they found around a third of DV victims we're men, but then the government launched a massive anti men DV  campaign with $100m funding, declaring it was all just bad men not respecting women. There's more funding for the pets of women DV victims than there are for men DV victims.\n\nIt's foobar.\n",

It may have once been true in fact (I'm not convinced, but it's possible), but it certainly isn't true now, at least not among adults.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm?s_cid=ss6308a1_e\n\nTable 6 discusses intimate partner violence.\n\n922,000 women were raped by an intimate partner.  962,000 men were made to penetrate by an intimate partner (which, if it weren't for the sexist work of Mary Koss, feminist academic, would be considered rape).  That's right - if one were to use a nonsexist definition of rape, more men were raped than women when it comes to intimate partner violence.\n\nWhen it comes to non-rape sexual coercion (this is things like threat of embarrassment, threats of leaving, etc - legal but sketchy as shit stuff) 1,752,000 women were victimized by such, compared to 1,044,000 men.  A little over 1/3 of the victims were men.\n\nUnwanted sexual contact isn't comparable because the sample size for men was too low.\n\nNoncontacted unwanted sexual experiences were 1,043,000 for women, and 929,000 for men.  Women are the majority there, but not by much.\n\nWhen it comes to physical violence, 4,774,000 were victims of domestic violence by their partner, compared with 5,452,000 men.  Again, men are the majority of victims of domestic violence.\n\nWhen it comes to severe violence (guns, knives, hit with something hard, etc), 2,752,000 women were victimized by such, compared with 2,374,000 men.  Women are the majority here, but again, not by a large percentage.\n\nSo when you say things like women are:\n\n>overwhelmingly higher percentage chance of being raped or abused by a partner\n\nYou are, wittingly or unwittingly, protecting rapists and domestic abusers.  You are, wittingly or unwittingly, hurting victims of rape and domestic violence.  You do so in the name of feminism.\n\nSome of us have a problem with that.",

It is somehow different psychologically if you are penetrated (raped). I disagree, especially since made to penetrate men cannot get abortions and have to pay the person that violated them (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermesmann_v._Seyer) every month for 18-21 years. If like me you considered forced envelopment (made to penetrate) equivalent to forced penetration (rape), then there are about the same amount of male and female victims.\n\n2) Men are more likely to be attacked on a street at night.\n\nThe National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) shows data by gender. I believe once the site is back up it will show that more men are victims of simple assault and aggravated assault.\n\nLinks to the 2014 and 2015 data will be at https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=92 when the site comes back up.\n\nThe argument why this doesn't matter is because most of the men are victims of other men, so men are evil. But there are still more male victims...\n\n3) Men are more likely to be non-reciprocal victims of domestic violence.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Health, domestic violence impacts roughly 25% of couples. In about 50% of those couples, the violence is mutual. In 35% of those couples only the woman is the violent one. In 15% of those couples only the man is the violent one.\n\nSource: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1854883/\n\nThe argument why this doesn't matter is that all reciprocal violence (where the overwhelming number of women get hurt because men are usually stronger) must be the fault of the man. It could only be mutual violence because the poor innocent woman is just defending herself and never instigating or escalating the violence. There is nothing to back this theory up, but there are in fact more male victims of DV.\n",

              "body": "\"Feminism has accomplished a lot for women.\"\n\n Yes, but post-modern feminism is way different. The initial strides of feminism strive for an egalitarian ideal. It justifiably set out to break the constraints placed on women by gender roles. \n\n\"The Patriarchy\" is often referred to as this abstract concept created to subjugate women and keep them oppressed in order to serve men. But first we have to look at the origins of humans to understand why civilization is structured this way. Men became heads of the tribe because they are biologically evolved to be protectors and women biologically evolved to be nurturers. Okay, so that is simple and we all can understand that. Now, these traditions carried on for many centuries with few exceptions. Men were strong, more aggressive by nature, and biologically evolved to assume roles of power. \n\nNow, let's incorporate a basic economic concept of trade offs: Men assumed roles of power at risk of being the first line of defense against dangers of the world. And women, assumed roles of submission in exchange for protection and also to nurture offspring. This arrangement is primitive and has lasted so long because it worked.\n\nOkay, so now we have a 20th century awakening on almost every existential realm possible. Belief in God, knowledge of the self and the unconscious, and, of course, concepts of gender equity. Along with this renaissance of enlightenment come along the feminist, who do indeed strive for women's equality, but this equality is a real and hard to digest kind. First wave feminist wanted to empower women to be themselves and face the dangers of world. The ancient contract between men and women no longer applies. \n\nYou ask if there are men's activist creating men's shelters, or male suicide hotlines, and it's almost poignant to ask the question. Because as it stands men account for 4/5 suicides, they are the largest segment of unemployed persons, they drop out of school at higher rates, they are sentenced 63% more prison time, account 93% of workplace fatalities and are over 90% in the makeup of war casualties. \n\nThe post-modern feminist is no longer okay with the contract men women created as a mutual trade-off, instead, they want to change society to Utopian ideal that is borderline authoritative. Now, when faced with the ultimate dangers in the world, they look to men as the predators, the causality of their oppression. Yesterday's feminist celebrated a woman's right to choose to wear whatever she wants and pursue whatever career. And today they are graduating at higher rates, and living longer. All this while still at sometime in their lives having children (which is incredible imo). The biggest thing you see feminist complain about is the wage gap yet no one ever talks about the fields male and females enter, and their respective salaries. Yes, men choose more profitable and sometimes less desirable careers overall. \n\nToday's feminist are loud and boisterous. They claim an abstract oppression that us men here don't see to exist. They claim equal grounds of the sexes except when it comes to custody of children, which is the most astonishing case of having your cake and eating too. \n\nWhen the Titanic began to sink, they called on all women and children to board the limited supply of lifeboats they had.

Are there any examples of men's shelters being run or suicide hotlines for men or financial support and legal advocacy for unfair child maintenance or anything like that?\n\nThere are voluntary organisations everywhere: see for example [Men's Sheds](http://www.mensheds.org.au/), [Fathers' Rights](http://www.mensheds.org.au/) and [Movember](https://au.movember.com/mens-health/mental-health). But these are all volunteer/ charitable organisations: in general, men's health (physical, and especially mental) comes a poor and distant second to women's. See, for example, what happened to [Earl Silverman](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/04/earl-silverman-suicide/315761/).\n\n> There's a hell of a lot of feminist-bashing in this sub.\n\nWell derr. This whole MRM thing is still finding its feet, and Feminism is an obvious target for our frustration and - yes - anger. What most of us are more fucked-off about are the blatant double standards prevalent in 'western' society (and India and elsewhere, come to that): 95% of workplace deaths; >75% of suicides; the appalling lack of DV shelters for fathers and their children, despite [peer-reviewed research](http://www.domesticviolenceresearch.org/) that shows DV is more-or-less 50/50; the global effects of the Duluth Model and so on. \n\nUnfortunately, some here haven't yet learned how to focus their justifiable) anger, and Feminism rarely fails to present an easy target. \n\n> I think you ought to take a harder line against that kind of talk in your group to be taken seriously as a political movement for good\n\nSpend some time going back through the archives and you'll realise that you are just the latest in a never-ending procession of recent visitors to say the same thing. If that approach worked, we would have adopted it by now. \n\n> I feel if I joined the men's rights movement I'd be distancing myself from the majority rather than a fringe, y'know?\n\nGiving a toss about boys and men and our human rights doesn't require a blood sacrifice, let alone relinquishing whatever other allegiances you have. We're not Feminists, after all. Besides, there are times when the majority view needs a good kick up the arse.\n\n> We're already fighting the same things.\n\nDo go on...\n\n>  Every single one of the problems I listed above is caused by the patriarchy. \n\n(sigh) And for a minute there I thought you were going somewhere useful. \n\n> Why are we not on the same side?\n\nBecause what you just typed.\n\nIf you really, **really** are genuine about wanting to \"get out of your comfort zone\", do some reading; do some research. \n\nDid you look at the sidebar? Did you?\n\n",

        "body": "'sup bro's.\n\nI haven't had much exposure to men's rights activism apart from feminist friends posting nonsense spouted by self-described MRA's. I reckon it's fairly likely that most of your experience with feminism is the same. I've poked around this sub and seen a fair bit of it.\n\nThing is, poking around this sub I've seen a lot of real issues. Boys being bullied and sexually abused, child custody, false accusations, suicide, all that. You guys are basically right about all that. I still call myself feminist rather than MRA because of other things; women got problems too (and I think where you fall on feminism/MRM depends largely on your experience since it's hard to quantify which gender has it harder when most of us haven't seen both sides), but I agree with you that these are all big issues.\n\nThree reasons why I'm not a card-carrying meninist:\n\n* Feminism has accomplished a hell of a lot over the past few years on which we can all agree. Decent stuff. The vote, jobs, better legal protection, closer-to-equal pay and a continued change in public discourse about women. In many circles it's no longer expected that women will be the head of the household while the men work, it's just one of many viable options. Granted men's rights activism isn't as old, but where are its accomplishments and what, practically, are members of the movement doing to achieve its aims? Are there any examples of men's shelters being run or suicide hotlines for men or financial support and legal advocacy for unfair child maintenance or anything like that?\n\n* There's a hell of a lot of feminist-bashing in this sub. I see some MRA-bashing in feminist circles, but it's nothing compared to what you guys have. I don't think \"hurr, stupid feminist\" is useful discourse to deal with gender issues. I think you ought to take a harder line against that kind of talk in your group to be taken seriously as a political movement for good. There are a lot of feminists I distance myself from, but I feel if I joined the men's rights movement I'd be distancing myself from the majority rather than a fringe, y'know?\n\n* We're already fighting the same things. Every single one of the problems I listed above is caused by the patriarchy. Men are supposed to be strong and in charge so they can't express their emotions and are more likely to be violent and held responsible for violence. Women are supposed to be meek and that's why they are more likely to get away with crimes they do commit and be believed when they make accusations. A man's place is in work so he pays for the children and a woman's place is in the home so she gets custody. If we didn't have these ingrained gender roles caused by centuries of male rule, neither feminism nor men's rights activism would have to exist. Linked to my previous point, why are we not on the same side? And yes, I've read the article in your sidebar. The very premise of \"feminists support legal bigotry and MRA's don't\" is incredibly flawed and the author argues strongly for division while simultaneously listing a bunch of issues that have the same root cause feminism intends to fight against. Why are we not on the same side?\n\nI might be wrong on all of this. I'm posting here to get out of my comfort zone and find some opinions that are different to my own so I can learn something. I'm grateful for any discourse you'd be willing to give and I'm not simply here to convince you of my viewpoint.\n\nAlthough if there's one thing I'd convince you of, it's this:\n\nAny time you see or hear anyone talk about men or women unfairly in the context of traditional gender roles: Challenge it.\n\n\n**EDIT**\n\nJust wanted to pop back to say thanks so much to everyone who replied. I didn't expect to change minds or for mine to be changed, but I have learned a lot about what you believe on the subject. Talking to people with whom you disagree is a very useful exercise, both to grow personally and to learn how to better interact with different types of people.\n\nMost of what I've learned from this thread is your opinion of feminism and what you see feminism to be, but my original opinion that the MRM and feminism belong together hasn't really changed. Feminism doesn't have to benefit men to be valid, but it does. And I can't speak for all feminists, because there are a tonne of different strands and ideas and whatnot out there, but for me I feel passionate about a lot of the same issues as yourselves and that gives me hope for the future of gender issues. We need to spend much less time and energy fighting each other and we could all do a lot of good.\n\nFinally, an apology. I had to duck out abruptly yesterday and do real life so I wasn't able to participate in the discussion any further. This also meant a few short responses. I did read everything that came back from it but in my own time later on and with comment notifications switched off. I have a busy job and there's only so much time I can spend with Internet arguments. Many of the responses I got from you were insightful, measured, well-considered and respectfully given and I'm deeply sorry that I wasn't able to give a proper reply to all of them.\n\nThanks again.",

My post here was not really a well thought out critique but more to just questioning these overarching themes. I posted it so I could get feedback and perspective. I still wonder if the writer or director subscribes to a particular ideology. Take for example, Batman The Dark Knight by Christopher Nolan. The Dark Knight is an amazing film and possibly my favorite film of 2008, however there is no question that Nolan was making a political message about terrorism. Also the third film in the trilogy, Dark Knight Rises once again is a subtle critique of Occupy Wall Street. Nolan's politics does not impact weather these films where good films, however it is interesting to be aware of his ideologies and how it frames his art. I still think there is evidence that the director, the writers, or someone in the hierarchy at Disney is actively influenced by feminist ideology (see Brave, Pixar is owned by Disney).\n\nI posted this for two reasons, one to point out these observations and secondly to get feedback on my perspective. The overall response I was given was that I was reading too much into the subject so I am happy to consed I was wrong. Once again, thanks for your excellent feedback.\n\nEdit: I really should have put a question mark at the end of the title in the OP.

Some people (like my HS English teachers) will argue that the curtains represent the mood, mindset, tranquility, etc. of the protagonist, while the author was really just trying to be descriptive, and chose blue at random. \nIn this case, it seems far more likely that the characters in the film are meant to be actors inside their games. Actually being good/evil has no impact on which role they play while their games are in operation. Aside from Turbo, there are no evil characters. The bugs don't even think for themselves, they're just robots. The \"villains\" (including Satan, or \"Sa-teen\") are shown to be normal fellows that go about their nine-to-five jobs as designated antagonists. Even Turbo didn't start out as evil; he was driven over the edge after newer games started replacing his. \nRalph isn't just some \"disposable male\", quite the contrary. He is completely indisposable since without him, the game has no purpose, and everyone in it is wiped out from the game's removal. \nRalph does not have anger issues, he's just tired and frustrated from thirty years lack of appreciation for his job. His journey culminates in accepting that his designated role of villain has no bearing on his true personality, which is very warm and caring. In fact, the more jackass-natured characters are the designated protagonists (the kids in Sugar Rush, the other characters from Ralph's game). None of the character's main traits are based upon their gender, it never really enters the equation. \nThe movie ends with Ralph continuing his role as antagonist in his game, but this time, the other characters realize how much he needs them, and have also accepted that while he is the \"bad guy\", he is not a bad guy. \nTL;DR- Gender is not part of the story and it's resolution. It's about an actor accepting that who he is is not dependent on the role he plays in the game, but on his own personal choices and personality. Oh, and the others learn to appreciate him. \n",

        "body": "**Just to be clear, I actually liked the move over all outside of this critique, the characters where lovable and well written and I didn't pick up on the final twist right away but I did see it coming before the big reveal in the 3rd act because I picked up what the movie was laying down not long after the first act. Superficially Wreck it Ralph(WIR) was amazing but was it's politics sexist?**\n\nWhen I say I don't appreciate the politics that where underpinnings of the film WIR, I mean just that, however superficially the movie was excellent. I also had the same issue with Brave*. In Brave, I loved the strong female lead characters as well as the art. The film was oozing with charm and stile. However, I didn't care for the message it sold that all men where waring stupid brutes who without the guidance of a woman would destroy themselves. Disney movies in the past have been appropriately criticized for there sexist traditionalist values and how the moralizing underpinnings of there moves devalues women and perpetuals an unhealthy meme. While Brave and Wreck it Ralph break free of those molds they are replaced with an equally sexist values, where all the male characters are buffoons, strong armed grunts or villains. Sexism is still sexism regardless of gender, so now that there is a role reversals in these films it doesn't begin to help solve the problem. Two wrongs don't make a right.\n\nWhat raised my suspicion and concerned me in WIR was Ralphs involvement with a 12 step program which mantra was \"I'm bad, and that's good! I will never be good and that's not bad!\". This line actually is ultimately what Ralph must accept and is integral to his story arch. It also represents proverbial mans need to except there role of servant to the greater good and his willingness to relinquishes his personal agency. The acceptance of powerlessness is also a dangerous proposition to personal liberty and it also is the building blocks of group think. I happen to be a huge opponent to 12 steps and think they are not only infective but dangerous (see [Pen and tellers Bullshit,12Stepping full episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU2YliYttnQ) to breafly understand where I'm coming from). Government supports 12 steps because it creates a complacent society and undermines rational thought. A rational aware society can not be as easily manipulated.\n\n**Massive Spoilers:** There is where I deconstruct the film to illustrate my point. Ralph is an analogue to traditional Male strength, he is the garbage man the construction worker the fire fighter the carpenter ect. Ralph must except that as a traditional white Male he is the Bad Guy. Felix is also the traditional male role model however his overarching truth is that he is not a hero by virtue of his deeds but by Privilege of the game. One mans journey in this plot is to realize his privilege (Felix) and the other is to accept his testosterone driven strength is inherently bad (Ralph). After all it's common knowledge that [\"The male is a biological accident: the Y (male) gene is an incomplete X (female) gene\"](http://www.womynkind.org/scum.htm). The last male character before I go on to talk about the women is the Main villain Turbo aka King Candy. Turbo represents the misogynistic idealistic roles of a bygone era. Turbo is Representative of the Patriarchy (this was foreshadowing that helped me recognize the twist coming). He was a hero of Privilege whose old game was no longer popular to a modern audience. Turbo dose not want to give up his power so he subverts, perverts and oppressed women, little girls in fact, to maintain his power over the Video game Sugar Rush. So in summery our male role models, while well written and characterized amount to Felix the privileged buffoon, Ralph the strong grunt with violent anger issues who must except that his role as \"the bad guy\" and Turbo the Oppressive villain.\n\nOn the other hand we have some amazingly strong and lovable Female charters in this move. I actually commend Disney for there strong women in this film and the move passes the painfully ineffectual trivial Bechdel Test. It is not the characterizations of the women that I take issue with and personally I would love to see more well written sympathetic strong women in video games. However there are a few things I do take issue with. One of them being how Sergeant Calhoun is physically abusive to Felix for comic effect as if to say [female domestic abuse is comedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muuFygvXPAM) (Check your privilege Felix). I also take issue with how Vanellope von Schweetz, who is so cute and lovable, is really an oppressed princess who is shamed by the other girls who would be considered gender traders or chauvinistic female to the feminist ideologues. Actually it's not exactly that Vanellope is a princess that bothers me but more so how it play's into this victim role under the oppression of the fictional [Patriarchy](http://www.dramabutton.com/). A nit pick but I also take issue with here proclaiming herself President because Sugar Rush land it is now a democracy. You see, you don't get to proclaim yourself anything in a democracy! I really did faceplam at this moment. To future clarify I would love to see a female president, if she was qualified, [Ayn Rand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpp5EXZZrgA) and fairly elected (as apposed to self appointed). If you are not aware Ayn Rand did not support the crony-capitalist conservative agenda infact she [openly spoke out about this party's corruption of the capitalist system](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4196WvmEcYM). Also a female president would shut up some Radical Feminist, so that would be a small benefit.\n\nSo if you got this far you might ask, but its a children movie why so SRS? Because the [misandric rhetoric](http://antimisandry.com/feminist-misandry/feminist-quotes-20106.html#axzz2OfgYJhat) of radical feminist patriarchy/ rape-culture ideology is a [non-falsifiable unscientific assumption](http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/popper_falsification.html) about humanity that is based on dogmatic assertions, is a branch of [Marxists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_feminism) propaganda (At lest accounting to Erin Pizzey a woman who is know for Establishing Europe's first domestic violence shelters in 1971). To me, the end goal is a totalitarian state run system not unlike the seductive yet terrifying sterilized dystopia in [A Brave New World by Aldous Huxley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World). As with Marxism there is a ruling class and subordinate class. The bourgeoisie, the oppressed proletariat or in other words the patriarchy and oppressed women power dynamic. They both create a victim narrative where the only solution is a totalitarian government watch dog state. Big brother is watching you. Because this is ideology based on a irrational belief system that per-supposes [that all men are sociopaths and rapist](http://www.atheistrev.com/2012/10/schrodingers-rapist.html) you have to indoctrinate children young and that is why I take issues with a kids move.\n\n**Aside for that, I loved it and I also cried when Ralph wrecked Vanellope's car. But we all know real men don't cry**\n_____________________________________________\n\n* <small>I know Brave was made by Pixar</small>",

You are just our past selves.\n\nThat's a bit presumptuous, isn't it?  You're essentially saying that any man who disagrees with you is doing so only because he's unenlightened, and will eventually see the truth, and become a dyed-in-the-wool MRA.  Do we not have room here for thoughtful disagreement, and can we not accept that reasonable people (men and women) can end up any shade of gray that they find logical?\n\n>Awww... pats you on the head like a cute little scamp\n\nBecause condescension is the way to sound reasonable and persuasive.\n\n>Fighting sexism against women and ignoring sexism against men is not fighting for equality,\n\nYes and no.  The sense from feminists seems to be that there are enough institutional safeguards against anti-male sexism (and that men have so much power) that they're still attempting to balance the scales.\n\nPerhaps this would be a chance to win some hearts and minds?  Put our best foot forward in explaining that there are cases of sexism against men, and that the fight against sexism requires both sides work together?  MRAs fighting to end sexism against women, and vice-versa?  Wouldn't that be something to strive for?\n\n>\"Women need more rights so there is equality\" is just playing victim, not seeking equality.\n\nAssuming that women are already equal, that'd be true.  But, this seems to be a matter of perspective.  Feminists view women as still being maligned and having fewer rights than men.  Simply saying \"well, you're just playing the victim here\" seems condescending at best.\n\nAnd, not for nothing, but since MRAs are advocating for more rights to men, can't the same argument be turned against us?\n\n>Are you really here for discussion or just to scream at us that we are wrong?\n\nI would have us ask ourselves the same question: are we here to discuss these issues, or just to circle-jerk how mistreated men are?  There seems to be an awful lot of \"if you don't agree with everything MRAs 'should' believe, you're an enemy\" talk here.\n\n>The patriarchy is not a catch-all for all your gripes about the world. It is not the dark side of the force. It is not satan. It is a convenient excuse for feminists to avoid responsibility.\n\nI can mostly agree with this one.  Though, the same thing cuts the other way.  Feminism is not an all-powerful evil force which can shift public policy at a whim in order to hurt men.\n\n>We believe in equality too.\n\nI guess this comes down to my desire that we practice what we preach.  I know what you're going to say:\n\n\"Bolshevik, we're fighting for equality, to bring things back into balance after feminism made life suck for men, and tilted the system against us\".  The problem is:\n\n*Both sides think that by fighting only for their own gender, they're fighting for \"equality\"*.  If we really wanted to fight against sexism, both sides need to admit that there are ways in which they're privileged (yes, there are), and ways in which they're maligned.\n\n>Please keep your shaming and insults to yourself.\n\nA good policy overall.  Could you direct some of that vitriol against some other posters here?  I'm an MRA, and I've gotten plenty of shaming and insults for not being a \"good enough\" MRA, or not supporting enough MRA \"issues\".\n\n>but don't just react with your pre-programmed conditioned assumptions.\n\nThe problem with this mindset is that someone can have thought critically, broken free of conditioning, and thought for him or herself, and still think that feminists are not conspiring specifically to hurt men, and that there's a lot of overreaction to relatively minor things.\n\nThe question of this conspiracy should be debated, not something to state as a with-us-or-you're-a-brainwashed-drone proposition.",

It's because THEY have an expectation to be coddled, or because THEY are indoctrinated, or because THEY are just lesser evolved versions of yourselves (Seriously, that's just fucking stupid.)\n\nThe fact is, there are serious issues concerning custody issues, rape laws, false accusations, and domestic violence that we all should be giving more attention to with respect to fairness to men. Gender equality is not a discussion that can happen disregarding either side of the binary or those beyond it. However, when the tone of the discussion begins from what essentially amounts to \"The men are an oppressed class, and if you disagree, you are either a part of the feminist conspiracy or you are suffering from one of several personality flaws I have attributed to you,\" it's not going to be going anywhere worthwhile.\n\nAnd frankly, if it seems to you like those in favor of gender equality are more concerned with equality for women as opposed to men, it's likely because men do have many social advantages over women. You cannot talk about social equality without considering social dynamics. Once again, it doesn't mean that achieving equality simply means making things better for women. However the attitude I see in this post, and in this subreddit in general, belittles women's movements and the realities of our society's history that called for them.

I always thought this was feminism- if men can work, women can work, if women can cry and have breakdowns and pms, men can express themseves emotionally too (If I said cry, or have breakdowns, I somehow feel every guy would jump on me and say \"we dont do that we don't do that...\")\n\nTo add- I think any true feminist would cry out against false rape accusations. People who cry wolf on rape foster an environment where people just assume every girl who says she has been raped is lying. False rape accusations make it so much harder for women who have actually been raped to come forth. I mean, women who lie about it tend to eventually retract their statements, which by then is too late to resuscitate the reputation of the falsely-accused. This causes a well-deserved backlash and makes people skeptic about all rape accusations, so that when a girl has suffered rape and needs to come forth, not only is she thinking about the awful things running through her head as a consequence of rape, but she probably doesn't want to face the skeptics and doesn't want to go through the motions of putting herself on display to argue her case tirelessly. False rape accusations hurt both men and women, and whoever thinks otherwise really hasn't put much thought into it. ",

Fighting sexism against women and ignoring sexism against men is not fighting for equality,\n\n2. \"Women need more rights so there is equality\" is just playing victim, not seeking equality.\n\n\n**\"I have a right to post here!\"**\n\nYes, but ask yourself why you are really in a subreddit that tries to discuss the issues of men's rights when it is not really allowed in feminist subreddits. Question your own motives. Are you really here for discussion or just to scream at us that we are wrong?\n\n\n**\"The patriarchy hurts everyone\"**\n\nThe patriarchy is not a catch-all for all your gripes about the world. It is not the dark side of the force. It is not satan. It is a convenient excuse for feminists to avoid responsibility.\n\n** \"No, but I really believe in equality!\"**\n\nGood. Seriously - good.

[Here is the proof](http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/1033)\n\n**\"You can't seriously be saying that feminists conspire against men\"**\n\nYes. We are saying that.  If you can't accept that, then just leave. You've been indoctrinated and are resisting breaking free of that conditioning. Think critically, question us, think for yourself - but don't just react with your pre-programmed conditioned assumptions. \n\n\n**\"Well this all seems very negative and you should value our comments about...**\n\nNo. We have no shortage of feminists coming here thinking their opinions are precious. We aren't interested in fostering more feminists posting here. If, however, you insist on posting here - then please lurk and listen for a while before jumping into discussions, disagreeing angrily, and/or openly trolling.\n\nLet me repeat that again : Feminists posting to mensrights are not rare.

I think you'll find that the majority view here is that *this* patriarchy, the one described by feminist academics ... doesn't exist.\n\nEven when they do talk about the dictionary's patriarchy, they seem to forget that while it's true most people in positions of power and influence are male... it's also true that most males have no such power and influence.\n\nFrankly I don't care what gender my politicians are, I'm more worried about their policies and viewpoints.

I want you to know it comes from someone who has suffered a lot. You can chose to believe that or not. When you get depressed and begin to consider suicide your mind turns inward and stops processing rationally. You get to a dark place where everyday, normal things take on sinister overtones. It becomes easier and easier day after day to start pushing motives and blame around, precisely because you're probably very hard on yourself. That level of criticism, when applied to others, leads to tragic outcomes.\n\nI strongly urge you to seek help. You need to know your mind just isn't processing right because of physical/chemical issues that can be reduced or corrected. It's no different than being a diabetic, or having cancer. There is no reason for you to feel ashamed, weak, or broken. It takes a very strong person to step into the light and ask for help.\n\nPlease.

He will make a terrible scene, often leave a corpse or three, and most times end as a corpse himself. Blazing Frank lives up to his monikker because he is frank and blazingly so, because he commits frankly blazing deeds, and because frankly, most times he goes out in a blaze!\n\n> You are doubtless familiar with some of Blazing Frank's incarnations: Marc Lepine, Darren Mack, Nicholas Bartha, Perry Manley, the Virginia Tech guy, the guy in the Amish Schoolhouse, and most recently George Sodini. That covers a few of the famous ones.\n\n> The feminists are madly in love with Blazing Frank\u2014they can't get enough of him, they can't stop talking about him, and his periodic reincarnation infuses new vitality and purpose into their world. When Frank flares up, the feminists go into a frenzied huddle of hyperventilated jabber with the same object or range of objects invariably in view. Always, to amalgamate the personal with the political; always, to embed the episode into the body of patriarchy theory; always, to construct a morality tale about men or maleness in the abstract; always, to generate anti-male spin or shore up anti-male bias; always, to build a rationale for anti-male legislation or political initiative in some form; always, to validate the feminist worldview in one way or another.\n\n> But that is not the only thing the feminists do. They also swarm through cyberspace like bugs in great thick clouds and settle invisibly upon MRA websites, there to lurk and listen to the MRAs buzzing about Blazing Frank. Then they fly back to their own spaces and report what they have heard.\n\n> For you see, on the subject of Blazing Frank, many MRAs (or people taken for such) are pleased to speak their minds not wisely but too well\u2014especially where the case involves women, or ugly divorce scenarios. And the feminists know this because they have seen the pattern replay itself over and over. What the feminists are looking for in their eavesdropping expeditions is \"scandal\" and \"dirt\", and far too often those men's rights loudmouths (or feminists posing as such) will indeed deliver the goods. They will say just what the feminists want them to say, just what the feminists need them to say, and this provides the feminist propaganda machine with the spin-fodder it needs for amplification and distortion operations.",

Let\u2019s go with that\u2026 it\u2019s not too harsh\u2026 anyway she was one of those types who was all into magik, esoteric teenage witchy shit, you know those Aleister Crowley worshipping types\u2026 the thing is being someone who is\u2026 how should I say\u2026 not a complete lunatic who believes in fairies and imaginary things\u2026 I stupidly assumed that all this stuff must just be some sort of harmless aesthetic curiosity for her because no self respecting adult would genuinely believe witchcraft is real. So I once stupidly half jokingly said to her you do realise magic isn\u2019t real right? And she exploded and started to abuse me and call me names and accuse me of all this shit. Now a normal human would have just said ok we have different opinions and leave it at that. But oh no not this self proclaimed broom stick riding daughter of darkness, she started coming at me with all these accusations saying I was a misogynist and not only that but also A RAPIST!!!!! Now to be clear this person had no idea about me and was not accusing me of actually raping any specific person, she was literally just I MUST BE A RAPIST BECAUSE I DONT BELIEVE IN WITCHES. But wait there is more\u2026 she then also said I WAS ALSO A RACIST BECAUSE BLACK CULTURES BELIEVE IN MAGIK (apparently) and me saying it\u2019s not real made me a racist\u2026 but here is the catch, THIS BITCH WAS FUCKING WHITE AND I AM A PERSON OF COLOUR!!!! And this bitch was here saying I was fucking racist LMAO \ud83e\udd23 So granted by this point I was also slinging insults her way (these were all email conversations by the way) but because I am big scary man me emailing her insults WHICH WERE IN RESPONSE TO HER INSULTING ME resulted in her threatening to call the cops on me for online harassment \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 because she genuinely believed I would burn her at the stake for being a witch and I\u2019m like BITCH I DONT EVEN BELIEVE THIS NONSENSE WHY WOULD I FUCKING BURN YOU AT THE STAKE FOR SOMETHING I KNOW NOT TO BE REAL????

The funny thing about all this is how worked up they get over such childish trivial things which is scary because you know they\u2019ll be 100x worse on more serious issues.",

It's just that a lot of feminists don't read the stuff that figures out the logical consequences.\n\nThis sort of mass conspiracy theory (\"men secretly run the world\") is common with hate movements.  eg the Nazis had something called the Zionist Overlord Government which had been running the world and attacking good white Germans.  Of course it's always inherently contradictory to simultaneously claim your group is both oppressed forever AND inherently superior to the people oppressing you.\n\nOf course in one sense men do run the world (or did) but never for the benefit of other men.

Robin Morgan, Ms. Magazine Editor\n* The nuclear family must be destroyed\u2026 Whatever its ultimate meaning, the break-up of families now is an objectively revolutionary process. Linda Gordon\n* I want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high-heel shoved in his mouth, like an apple in the mouth of a pig. Andrea Dworkin\n* Since marriage constitutes slavery for women, it is clear that the women\u2019s movement must concentrate on attacking this institution. Freedom for women cannot be won without the abolition of marriage. Sheila Cronin, the leader of the feminist organization NOW\n* Marriage as an institution developed from rape as a practice. Andrea Dworkin \n* The institution of sexual intercourse is anti-feminist. Ti-Grace Atkinson\n* Rape is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear. Susan Brownmiller, Against Our Will p.6\n* When a woman reaches ****** with a man she is only collaborating with the patriarchal system, eroticizing her own oppression. Sheila Jeffrys\n* Politically, I call it rape whenever a woman has sex and feels violated. Catherine MacKinnon\n* The more famous and powerful I get the more power I have to hurt men. Sharon Stone\n* Ninety-five percent of women\u2019s experiences are about being a victim. Or about being an underdog, or having to survive\u2026 women didn\u2019t go to Vietnam and blow things up. They are not Rambo. Jodie Foster, quoted in The New York Times Magazine\n* The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately 10% of the human race. Sally Miller Gearhart, in The Future \u2013 If There Is One \u2013 Is Female\n* And if the professional rapist is to be separated from the average dominant heterosexual (male), it may be mainly a quantitative difference. Susan Griffin, Rape: The All-American Crime\n* If life is to survive on this planet, there must be a decontamination of the Earth. I think this will be accompanied by an evolutionary process that will result in a drastic reduction of the population of males. Mary Daly\n* If anyone is prosecuted for filing a false report, then victims of real attacks will be less likely to report them. David Angier\n* Men who are unjustly accused of rape can sometimes gain from the experience. Catherine Comins\n* As long as some men use physical force to subjugate females, all men need not. The knowledge that some men do suffices to threaten all women. He can beat or kill the woman he claims to love; he can rape women\u2026he can sexually molest his daughters\u2026 THE VAST MAJORITY OF MEN IN THE WORLD DO ONE OR MORE OF THE ABOVE. Marilyn French\n* I believe that women have a capacity for understanding and compassion which man structurally does not have, does not have it because he cannot have it. He\u2019s just incapable of it. Barbara Jordan, former Congresswoman\n* Probably the only place where a man can feel really secure is in a maximum security prison, except for the imminent threat of release. Germaine Greer\n* Man-hating is everywhere, but everywhere it is twisted and transformed, disguised, tranquilized, and qualified. It coexists, never peacefully, with the love, desire, respect, and need women also feel for men. Always man-hating is shadowed by its milder, more diplomatic and doubtful twin, ambivalence. Judith Levine\n* Women have their faults / men have only two: / everything they say / everything they do. Popular Feminist Graffiti\n* We are taught, encouraged, moulded by and lulled into accepting a range of false notions about the family. As a source of some of our most profound experiences, it continues to be such an integral part of our emotional lives that it appears beyond criticism. Yet hiding from the truth of family life leaves women and children vulnerable. Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women\n* I do want to be able to explain to a 9-year-old boy in terms he will understand why I think it\u2019s OK for girls to wear shirts that revel in their superiority over boys.

We can't do anything about that. The problem is right now they've got the upper hand in mainstream politics, and that's what makes it really, really, *really*  dangerous.",

For example, most feminists I have spoken to would absolutely be in favour of equal rights in family courts, support male SA/domestic abuse victims and do not hate men.\n\nThe problem with feminism is that it is a religion. It doesn't matter if someone doesn't believe every tenant of their religion, their support is enough to enforce these tenants anyway.\n\nThe entire basis of the feminist religion is 'the patriarchy', the idea that 'men' in powerful positions will only ever use their privileges to make 'men' as a group more powerful than women. This is 100% projection as this is what feminist do, feminists are the ones that lobby for one specific sex and only ever empower that specific group. \n\nAs long as they believe in 'the patriarchy' they really aren't any better as the ones that do hate males.",

That is a scary thought asking a controversial question anywhere. I\n\nI know those feminists that are truly about ''equality''. But they are first of all in the few because the biggest contributor to feminism are clearly not in favour of, to make it short, the acknowledgement that male victims exist nor that are some that are ''justified'' to be victims. Which leads to many problems such as a pushback for Safe Homes for Male Domestic Violence victims, or the appreciation that men do dangerous and essential jobs which puts their lives at risk. Besides that, even the ''good feminists'' that I have met are still surprised in how many aspects men still truly suffer, a common one is how little of them know that divorce courts nearly all the time side with the wife/mother without a proper ground basis. The reason for that is that is that many ideas of feminism is still in their believes and those ideas stem from extreme times which we already are far away from. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe do not hate feminism in the sense of \\*preserving\\* women's rights, we dislike it in the sense that there is a ''fight'' despite in the time of peace.

I still remember in elementary school hearing the future is female and thinking??? We\u2019ll fuck me I guess. And about how smart girls are and how boys are dumb. And sure I wasn\u2019t that bright growing up but that was cause of the abuse and lack of nutrition with would affect cognitive abilities. Only reason im alive and have a strong work ethic is cause I got to see my dad on weekends. He was strong, firm with his beliefs, had good values, believed in family first. And loved me, truly, maybe he didn\u2019t show it the way ppl want to. But he was there for me even while he worked 80-100 hours a week. I even found out that his wife had wanted to move away when I was little. And he told her, no. My son lives here, so I live here. And I truly respect him for it. I appreciate everything he did for me. And the other day I told him about how much I remember of the abuse. And he literally broke down saying he always wished that I\u2019d forget everything she did to me. He said how much he tried to fight for me. But the lawyers told him there was no way he\u2019d win. He was illegally here originally and there was a bias that she was the mother. I just wish ppl could stop with just thinking it\u2019s men that abuse. That men are only violent, even recently my fianc\u00e9e joked saying your so calm but you love martial arts and did boxing at a high level. I told her yeah but when was the last time I fought someone? She couldn\u2019t answer and I told her exactly just cause I like it and like to be prepared doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m violent. Plus I learned martial arts at a young age cause of the abuse. I wanted to be able to protect myself and ppl I would love in the future. Now that I have ppl that I care about and that care about me. I\u2019m happy I could protect them. And fear losing them. It took a long time to even understand and learn how to love. I feel bad for my fianc\u00e9e who dealt with me with very little emotions or social skills because of the abuse. But she appreciates everything I do for her now. Honestly I hope the best for men.",

Feminism wants male DV victims arrested.\n\nIn 1996 or so feminists wrote the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) which among other things denies male DV victims recognition as DV victims and denies any resources to male DV victims. But that was not enough, some female abusers were still being arrested and feminism could not support that, so in the next VAWA re-authorization feminism changed the previous Primary Aggressor model to the feminist written Duluth Model. What is the Duluth Model you might ask?\n\n* Duluth is predicated on the \"patriarchal terrorism\" paradigm of partner violence. That is, men beat their female partners in order to assert masculine dominance within their relationships. Their motives are to conform to patriarchal norms and to reify a the patriarchal social/political/cultural order of male dominance and female subordination within the home.\n\n* Under this faulty model, women cannot, as a conceptual matter, perpetrate partner abuse. If they hit their male partners, it was in self defense. If they hit first, or are the only partner who hits, they are doing it within the context of \"violent resistance\" against presumed emotional or psychological abuse on his part.\n\nBecause the VAWA also requires mandatory arrest policies, the VAWA + Duluth literally requires police to arrest male DV victims of females.\n\nFeminism literally wants to have male DV victims arrested and ideally prosecuted, and they've written laws to make that happen.",

But it\u2019s not an exaggeration at all. I\u2019m in nyc. Place well known for being left and for being strongly feminist. \n\nI went to a school named MARYMOUNT MANHATTAN COLLEGE. Fucking avoid it, it\u2019s high key feminist to the point that it\u2019s 80% female to 20% male and probably half or less of those males are straight. So basically feels like 90-95% of the students don\u2019t like you especially if your in the art field. I had a professor literally say how her favorite play was of men being killed. That was it. That was the plot she gave. And ppl laughed and clapped. \n\nI had a classmate who loved to do art about female monsters that kill men. And she was a good artist( im pretty good at realism in art) but she hated men so much she didn\u2019t even like speaking to them. She acted awkwardly social around men like she didn\u2019t want to be there but perfectly normal around women. At one point my class talked about past lives which I found stupid. One of my guy friends ( one of the few normal guys) said he feels like he was a jester. She responded she thinks all guys are a joke. Which he told me later Pissed him off. And apparently she said her past life she was a wife who hated and abused her kids. As someone who was severely abused by my mom ( to the level that I was basically mute, she\u2019d punch me awake, beat me swollen and cracked my skull at one point) I got pissed hearing a joke about abusing kids. And there were many who loved the killing men joke and said they\u2019ve called men trash and the typical feminist troopes that ppl mention. \n\nLike saying men are useless and more. Or men are cheaters but acting like women are angels that would never. Honestly I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s a blind ignorance of reality. They\u2019re truly sexist but don\u2019t notice it. They\u2019ve become what they hate and don\u2019t even realize it cause men have for the most part improved in certain ways. There\u2019s always room for improvement and no such thing as perfection but overall mens issues are usually not considered at all from what I\u2019ve seen and those classes they push it. One class they even said a wife gave up her husband to fight in a war\u2026. Not he gave up his life for his country. No he was just some pawn. And I had multiple teachers and classmates that would basically act like being white and male meant your the spawn of satan himself. Mind you I\u2019m Honduran and I get tired of hearing white people are the problem. As if the whole world hasn\u2019t done even worse things than America has. \n\nBut either way I\u2019ve seen it they\u2019re pushing it into colleges especially the arts and more. And they spread it to their kids and they have even more groups on Facebook shitting on men( my fianc\u00e9e had joined one and she left cause they didn\u2019t like her telling them to communicate with their partner. They acted like that was the worst like you have to blindly follow or be shunned)",

When doing the mathematical mean to compare collectives, you gotta cut out the extremes because in the extremes always wierd stuff happens. If you cut the best privileged people and the less privileged people, you end up with something different. For instance, its said that women get paid (on average) less than men, but that because theres some psycho men out there who will only live to work, and if you cut this people out, the gender paygap is not that different from one another because the typical salary to observe in a normal male is as high as the typical salary to observe in a normal female (typical salary is not the same as average salary). And so, having the majority of most privileged people being male, doesnt mean that the typical male gets to be more privileged than the typical female.

That's delusional self deception.\n\n>Listen, if you want to call yourself a feminist, I don't care. I've been investigating feminism for more than 9 years now, and people like you used to piss me off, because to my mind all you were doing was providing cover and ballast for the powerful political and academic feminists you claim are just jerks. And believe me, they ARE jerks. If you knew half of what I know about the things they've done under the banner of feminism, maybe you'd stop calling yourself one.\n\n>But I want you to know. You don't matter. You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: \"Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,\" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, \"we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.\"\n\n>You're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.\n\n>You're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were \"ambivalent about their sexual desires\" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.\n\n>You're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.\n\n>You're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.\n\n>You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.\n\n>You're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.\n\n>You're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.\n\n>You're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's \"part of her sexual history.\"\n\n>You're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is \"not a crime\" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a \"legal\" way to rape them.\n\n>And you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.\n\n>You're the true feminist.

And I have *never*, not once, been given respect, courtesy, or a fair hearing of my opinions. The hostility that exists within feminists spaces against *anyone* that doesn't declare themselves also a feminist is nothing short of haunting.\n\nFeminism is a cult. It actively attacks anything that is not itself. It discourages outside opinions, information, dialogue, or activities. It actively seeks to alter information in order to promote its messages and rhetoric. It denounces and vilifies anything that disagrees with it. And it is completely remorseless in the pursuit of its own purposes and goals. With absolute disregard for anything else that doesn't conform to it.\n\nThis has been my personal objective experience with feminism for a decade. On every platform, in every instance, without exception. The most successful exchanges I have had with feminists have been pyrrhic in nature where those I was speaking with heard me, but refused to back down from their own stances. I have never seen anyone that self identified as a feminist back down on their talking points. Ever.\n\nNo one in feminists spaces, leanings, teachings, academia, politics, or social circles gives a shit about anything that isn't already feminism. That is my personal judgement, and the judgement of MANY others, based on personal interactions, experiences, and activities engaged with feminists over a prolonged period of time.\n\nIn my personal judgement. Feminism is at this time the most **evil** force in the world today. And I am shocked on a daily basis by how anyone who knows feminism can honestly proclaim otherwise. Reasonable feminists do not exist. I have never met one, and I have looked. If someone is reasonable, they are not a feminist for long. Because Feminism does not tolerate such a thing.",

They are in general nice people but I am too afraid to admit to them that i am against feminism.\n\nI recently told two of my really close female friends and let's just say it escalated into an argument. We have been friends for about a decade now. Instead of understanding my reasons why I support advocacy for mens's right it devolved into calling me naive and having internalized misogyny, and being misguided. That women have it worse and men are the reason for all the problems etc and the usual contradictory feminist talking points. Was being treated as if I wanted women to be stripped of all rights and become slaves to men. I am a woman myself. I am afraid that this same thing will happen if I come out friends I'm not close with. Worse they might try to get me fired.\n\nI find it difficult to express myself when I am emotionally agitated so I suggest that they try and visit some men's rights groups only and see and decide to themselves. As my aim is not to convert them but to explain my position.\n\nI know it is my personal experience but I'd rather not risk it",

However, sometimes I get the impression that many people on this sub assume that feminists think a certain way when they do not. For example, most feminists I have spoken to would absolutely be in favour of equal rights in family courts, support male SA/domestic abuse victims and do not hate men. \n\nThe only thing that I see that (essentially) *all* feminists believe that I can understand causes controversy on this sub is the idea of patriarchy, male privilege etc. \n\nIs there something I\u2019m missing here?

However, \n\n>now come to information era or modern era. patriarchy now is not a thing due to feminists movements\n\nI do not agree with this. This may be true for Western countries, but definitely not for thirdworld, postcolonial countries. People in my country (and many, many others) reject feminism on the basis that it is \"western propaganda\" due to intergenerational trauma from actual western propaganda that was used to exploit us before. \n\nThis also means that the natural formation of patriarchy from before civilisations rose to what they are now, has persisted, and infact gotten worse due to religious fundamentalism. People fail to see how the patriarchy/any other power hierarchy is harmful, they simply accept it to be part of life because it has lasted this long and shun anyone who goes against it. You can see this in the fact that non-western countries often commit huge human rights violations.\n\nSo I think there definitely should be an emphasis on things like the patriarchy (and any other power hierarchy) so that the fight for equality is more effective. Whether that should be a feminist movement, or an egalitarian movement, is up for debate. Personally, I think it should be a feminist movement for now, but I also think that as we progress and women become more on par with men (as in western countries) we should turn to looking at these things through a broader perspective. I believe this can still be done with feminism, by simply being aware of our female-centric perspective and learning to look from other perspectives instead.\n\nImo, that western feminists have focussed on the female-centric view for too long and thrown men under the bus, which in turn caused them to despise feminists. If you look closely, it all just seems to be a cycle of trauma. We need to break that cycle and realise that our goals are one and the same. To achieve equality. Teaching each other and looking from each others perspectives will be far more effective then focussing on tearing each other apart.\n\nAnyways, sorry for the long rant and thank you for contributing to my post!!",

What was the purpose of that?  You're attacking people here from the beginning.\n\n> y'all deny that men's rights issues do not stem from patriarchy\n\nLanguage note:  Just say \"you all\".  \"Y'all\" is a Southern expression and it comes off as an attempt to be jokey.  Also you have a \"double negative\" here.  ie \"deny\"...\"not\".   It should be either \"deny that men's rights issues stem from patriarchy\" or \"claim/say/state that men's rights issues do not stem from patriarchy\".  Either is fine.\n\nSo this is false.  Men's rights issues stem from patriarchy in the original (Anthropological) meaning of the word because when men are in charge they attack other men.  Feminists say the opposite because they hate men and lie about everything.  Feminist \"patriarchy\" is a bizarre conspiracy theory where men in charge means other men are better off and women are oppressed.  No actual patriarchy works that way.  Under patriarchies women are protected and the 99% of men are abused.\n\n> Statistically, women face more violent oppression\n\nThey do not.\n\n> which makes people focus on those issues more than on men's rights issues\n\nPeople have compassion on women and fear men - a natural tendency that feminists exploit and encourage.  That is why people tend to focus on women more, that and the success of the feminist hate movement.\n\n> This isn't a contest\n\nThen why did you make the claim?  Feminists always make it a contest.\n\n --------------\n\nFew people will read all you wrote because you started off saying you are part of a hate movement.  Why would they need to read further?  I did read further and it makes everything else you said a lie.  So you're going to have to just start all over and explain why you think you should get a friendly reception here while part of a hate movement attacking men.\n\n> I wanted polite discourse, not this mess\n\nThat's a lie.

                                "body": "Sources for feminists protecting female rapists\n\nFor statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced penetration of the victim in most of the world. Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn. I encourage you to listen to what she is saying. (Really. Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)\n\nShe is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US. She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the \"victims\" didn't. A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was. As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely \"unwanted contact\"\n\nYou see she has been saying this for decades and was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics. E.g.\n\nDetecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (June 1993) Page: 206\n\nAlthough consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.\n\nSrc: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf\n\nShe is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women. There was a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared. She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies. That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime. Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.\n\nMost people talking about sexual violence refer to the \"rape\" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for \"made to penetrate\" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.\n\nAs an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm\n\nan estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey\n\nand\n\nThe case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.\n\nvs\n\nan estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey\n\nand\n\nCharacteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators. For three of the other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%), sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),\n\nSo if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims. If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of \"made to penetrators\" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women.\n\nBut since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. /r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/). Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females. These misleading stats are ammo to tell men to shut up about rape because 1 in 5 women are raped vs \"only\" 1 in 71 men and dismiss raped men because men are one group \"nearly all the men were raped by other men\" so somehow raped men are to blame because they are men...\n\nAnd before you think that was just one study, it wasn't. The prior year numbers have been really close between the sexes most years.\n\n2010 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_ipv_report_2013_v17_single_a.pdf\n\n2012 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf\n\n2015 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf\n\nScientific American - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known\n\ndata revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.\n\nAnd non CDC study...\n\nA recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.\n\nThe Atlantic - https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/\n\nAnother non CDC study...\n\na 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.\n\nAnd another non CDC study...\n\nNational Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had \u2018ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,\u2019 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.\u201d\n\nTime - http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers\n\nwhen asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d\u2014either by physical force or due to intoxication\u2014at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).\n\nIf my information is not enough, try reading these threads by problem_redditor with lots more studies and references.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/i0j2g9/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/i6sdli/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys_part/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/iavcnv/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys_part/\n\nJust maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one. But if we acknowledge that, then we would have to point the blame at \"rapists\", rather than \"men\".\n\nAnd it isn't just the US.\n\nFeminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms\n\nSo a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.\n\nIsraeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.\n\nhttps://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape\n\nNepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...\n\nWomen\u2019s rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn\u2019t empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims\u2019 fight for justice.\n\nhttps://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/12/11/ordinance-amends-law-on-rape-but-fails-to-recognise-rape-of-boy-child-and-sexual-minorities\n\nEven if you only care about women, you should still stop women from raping because the majority of men convicted of raping women were sexually violated by adult women when they were boys. Multiple studies in the US, UK, and Canada have shown this. Around 10 of them cited here.\n\nhttp://empathygap.uk/?p=1993#_Toc498111528\n\nSo women not raping, and rape by women being acknowledged as traumatic and treated with compassion, would probably stop a lot of women from getting raped in the future. That should matter if the goal is to stop women from getting raped rather than to demonize men.",

People have been dying for centuries, marital rape, honor killings, induced abortions, just so much horror that still exists to this day in rural areas. Feminism being introduced by people who had visited first world countries helped improve the lives of many people here. There are many more still waiting to have their own chance to migrate to first world countries because they want to have freedom, and they perceive feminism as that freedom. So I have a personal tie to feminism as well. \n\nI acknowledge that the western movement has hurt some in the process of helping others and I wish to understand more of y'all's perspectives so that I can avoid doing the same.

As for the anti-women comments, are you sure you're not just reading criticism of hypergamy as hating women as a group?\n  \n> As I explained in my definition of the Patriarchy, no gender is accused of being psychopaths.\n  \nIf the following is true: \n  \n* Society is Male Dominated\n  \n* Male dominance privileges men over women\n  \n* While some men can sometimes be harmed by this system, the system itself is set up to privilege men and subjugate women for mens express benefit.\n  \n* Men are in power and the system operates to benefit and serve mens' needs, drives, and interests at the expense of womens' needs, drives, and interests.\n  \nAnd:\n  \n* oppression of women is bad; \n  \nThe conclusion is: \n  \n1) Male dominance equals womens oppression\n  \n2) The system is set up to benefit mens' needs, drives, and interests\n  \nTherefore: womens' oppression is in-keeping with mens' needs, drives, and interests. Since oppression of women is bad, that means evil is in-line with mens' needs, drives and interests. Therefore, men are innately evil. \n  \n> I'm not sure where you are from, but where I'm from, the opposite is true. Try to look at this from a global perspective! \n  \nWhat rights do women lack that men have? If you can find any, are they coupled with responsibilities that men are held to and not women? For comparison, here are actual legal rights that men lack and women have:\n\n* Presumed custody of children in the case of divorce. This was exacerbated by the Tender Years Doctrine, spearheaded by first-wave feminist Caroline Norton, and perpetuated by modern feminists through lobbying groups' efforts against rebuttable presumed shared custody.\n\n* Seperation of consent to sex from consent to parenthood and the responsibilities thereof. Feminist commentators have said that a unilaterally male-controlled contraceptive would \"take away womens' choices\".\n\n* Bodily integrity (i.e., genital mutilation. For girls its a violation of international law; for men it's at best unusual but tolerable, and at worst actively campaigned for as an eroneous means of combating AIDS). Feminists, while claiming to be advocates for \"equality\", are curiously quiet on this issue, compared to their efforts on FGM.\n\n* Immunity from accusations of rape. Rape requires the perpetrator to have a penis, so when women engage in nonconsentual sex with men, he is more likely to be charged than she is. This is mainly the work of Feminist researcher Mary Koss, from whom feminists get the eroneous 1-in-4 statistic. And if a woman gets pregnant from raping a man (or boy), she can sue her rape victim for child support.",

As for anti-women content, some posters on this subreddit have posted about gold-digging/controlling women (they drew alarming generalisations) so I came to that conclusion. I to acknowledge that there are people who are genuinely caring towards men's rights issues.\n\n>Feminists can claim that it's \"just about equality\", but it's equality based on bigotted assumptions, presuming psychopathy on the part of men as a class. \n\nAs I explained in my definition of the Patriarchy, no gender is accused of being psychopaths. The patriarchy is simply a societal system that assigns certain characteristics to maleness (one being aggresion yes) and femaleness. I have observed that most feminists harbor a hatred towards men, likely a trauma response or because they are simply uneducated (not justifying their actions, i thing their actions are detrimental to the goal of achieving equality). \n\n>Egalitarian values, and mens rights advocacy in particular, is innately antifeminist.\n\nWell I mean, atleast y'all advocate for equality right? I've heard of feminists being anti-men as well. Why are we anti-anything? As I explained in another comment, movements held in the past where some with what knowledge the people had back then (and the same applies to now). We are all simply trying our best (and making mistakes along the way). To latch onto those negatives are ignore the positives (of both the men's rights movement and feminism) is detrimental to society don't you think?\n\n>The Duluth Model of domestic violence is the investigative standard. It was a feminist construct that was designed to \"correct\" evidence that domestic abuse was gender non-directional to the feminist-approved male perpetrator/female victim paradigm. \n\nI'm unfamiliar with this concept and will read up on it.\n\n>I'm sure it has nothing to do with feminist activism to lower the standards of evidence for rape allegations, promotion of \"rape culture\" narrative, and the work of feminist researcher Mary Koss (paid for by feminist publication Ms. Magazine) that was integral to rape being defined as something only a cisgendered man can do. \n\nRegarding the \"lowering standards part\" you have to understand that people were being raped and unable to report it due to shame/stigma. So I believe that making it easier for them to report it was a good thing. However, defining rape culture as something only a man can do is detrimental to all of it. You're right there, I've definitely observed people assuming men to be more likely of raping/assaulting. You also have to understand their pov (however convoluted this notion is) to be able to change that particular notion. Trauma simply makes them overgeneralise (this isn't a justification for their actions btw!). As a women, I find myself scared of being alone in a room with a man, eventhough it is unfair of me to assume that, simply because past things I've experienced. I'm working on changing my perspectives tho, as I'm sure others are doing. \n\n>This is what feminists do when people try to hold events about the male suicide epidemic.\n\n\nThat's definitely fucked up.\n\n>Why are you putting this on male-dominated \"Patriarchy\", when it's clearly a reaction to womens' selection? You're trying to absolve women of any influence whatsoever.\n\nThe patriarchy absolves the blame from everyone. It simply points out how social interactions shape our views of ourselves.\n\n>Men have fewer legal rights than women. Apparently, women are the victims of that.\n\nI'm not sure where you are from, but where I'm from, the opposite is true. Try to look at this from a global perspective!

Can you find woman-hating content here, or just antifeminist?\n  \n> Let's establish what's patriarchy first . The wikipedia definition is very straightforward: Patriarchy is a social system in which men hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property. \n  \nMotte and Bailey. Feminists go back and forth between \"patriarchy is just the man being the head of a family\" and \"patriarchy is a system of society that privileges men and oppresses women\". \n  \n[The foundational principals of all flavours of feminism (class warfare between men and women with men winning, shorthanded as \"Patriarchy\") are inherrently anti-male when you examine what needs to be true for them to accurately describe reality.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/j018cf/is_pseudofeminism_even_a_thing/g6n373j/) Feminists can claim that it's \"just about equality\", but it's equality based on bigotted assumptions, presuming psychopathy on the part of men as a class. \n  \nEgalitarian values, and mens rights advocacy in particular, is innately antifeminist.\n  \n>  Statistically, women face more violent oppression\n  \nProve it.\n  \n> men not receiving child custody: the patriarchal society views women (femininity) as more suited towards caring for young, making people lean towards granting women child custody as opposed to a man. \n  \nThis is down to the Tender Years Doctrine, from the work of first wave feminist Caroline Norton. Prior to that, the legal standard was default father custody - he's expected to support a child, he has custody. Feminist activism inverted this standard, and continues to oppose all attempts to reform the system to this day. \n  \n> men getting abused/assaulted: the patriarchal society views men as dominant, and thus, violent/aggresive (leaders) and not emotional (feminine trait). So people struggle to grasp that men can be abused/assaulted and suffer trauma from such an incident in the first place, because men are perceived to more likely to BE in that role. This also factors in on my next point.\n  \nThe Duluth Model of domestic violence is the investigative standard. It was a feminist construct that was designed to \"correct\" evidence that domestic abuse was gender non-directional to the feminist-approved male perpetrator/female victim paradigm. \n  \n>  False rape allegations are basically people who are taking advantage of the assumption that men are more likely to be in the role of rapist/assaulter because the patriarchy deems men as \"dominant\", which is synonymous with violent/aggresive.\n  \nI'm sure it has nothing to do with feminist activism to lower the standards of evidence for rape allegations, promotion of \"rape culture\" narrative, and the work of feminist researcher Mary Koss (paid for by feminist publication Ms. Magazine) that was integral to rape being defined as something only a cisgendered man can do. \n  \n> suicide rates among men: the patriarchal society expects men to be \"strong\" and dominant, and the assumption is made that external events would not affect them (and even if they did, men are expected to hide them and be expressionless). This makes men themselves repress emotions, stunting emotional growth and making them prone to mental illness. \n  \n[This is what feminists do when people try to hold events about the male suicide epidemic](https://youtu.be/iARHCxAMAO0).\n  \n> The assumption that men should be strong comes with the expectations for men to be physically fit, and not just in a way that seems you healthy but in a way that pleases a women\n  \nWhy are you putting this on male-dominated \"Patriarchy\", when it's clearly a reaction to womens' selection? You're trying to absolve women of any influence whatsoever. \n  \n> notice how certain priviliges enjoyed by man is stemming from the oppresion of women.\n  \nMen have fewer legal rights than women.

I have been a rather simpy, weak guy for a long time, and it made me feel bad and unsatisfied. Now, I am finding myself and trying to become more masculin, by practicising martial arts, taking responisbility and overcoming even very high odds.

No matter how much you try to to find what \"most men\" or most women\" want, the truth is, every individual has different preferences, sometimes these preferences align with norms, and sometimes they don't. So imo, using generalisations in arguments about equality is not gonna help anyone coz it's detrimental to those who don't fit the norms, and the whole concept of equuality is that everyone is on equal footing regardless of whether they fit these Norma or not. \n\nUsing generalisations in everyday conversation is alright I guess, but again, you have to be careful and realise that different people want different things. Sometimes a women may prefer taller men, sometimes a man may prefer feminine woman, but it's not **everyone** and it's not even **most** people in the world because beauty standards differ from culture to culture. Maybe you can make a generalisation for your immediate social circle, but to make it globally, could easily lead to prejudice and discrimination.\n\n>Also, I don't think feminism is about freedom of choice anymore. In recent years, the \"you can do, what you want\" has been slowly replaced with a \"you should\" and now \"you must\". This is true for both genders, even tho, for men it has been replaced with a general \"you musn't\"\n\nHmm can you give me some examples? Most \"you must\" and \"you mustn't\" statements that I've heard from feminists have actually been for the betterment of people. For example, you mustn't stalk someone in the name of pursuing them romantically, you mustn't coerce someone into having sex, you must ask for consent and respect boundaries at all times. These things are pretty respectable notions.\n\n>You musn't act masculin\n\nWoah! I haven't heard this one. This is defo not something I stand for. I've not heard feminists around me say this either. It's more like \"you can express yourself in whatever way you like as long as you don't harm anyone\". Atleast, this is what I've heard the feminists around me say. If someone says \"you mustn't be masculine\" I would assume they are misandrist.\n\n>You musn't approach women, you creep. You musn't act on your needs.\n\nAgain, haven't heard of these things, and I would assume the other person is a misandrist labelling themselves as feminist. Honestly tho, I'd advice men to approach women in the most non-threatening way possible because most of us are pretty traumatised from having been sexually assaulted since we were literal kids. But other than that, I'd say these statements are kinda dumb.\n\n>You must show your emotions.\n\nShowing emotions is healthy, but to shame/coerce someone into it is bad. Any feminist who does so is in the wrong.\n\n>You musn't be a burden on a woman and give her emotional labour... \n\nOoffff. I see where you're coming from. This statement imo should apply to everyone, not just woman. Some (actually most) feminists simply look at things from a female-centric perspective, neglecting men in the process of trying to achieve equality. \n\n>Also, I don't really care for the achievements in the past, if the movement isn't about that type of achievement anymore, but purposefully destroying things, like it does.\n\nI understand, but the movement in Malaysia atleast, has brought about changes (albeit small since feminism is a fairly new concept here), and to dismiss it means that we go back to what we were before (which no Malaysian woman or even man, wants). \n\n>I, for my part, don't care for equality at all. What I want is the most freedom for everyone involved. That means accepting masculinity, if people want to act masculin, women staying at home, if they want and not conquering the workplace or the STEM fields and not grabbing power, if they don't want to.\n\nMy dude, this is exactly what equality is! As you've said, the feminist movement, even with its achievements, has warped the meaning and perspective of equality into something it's not. I'd say this is actually largely the fault of mass media, with marketing efforts being focussed on catering to females and thus, casting more of the lime light on a female-centric view of feminism. \n\n>And I want people to stop lying about things, like the gender pay gap, which is truely a gender choice gap, or about glass ceilings, which haven't existed for a long time. Also, a choice ceiling, there.\n\nHmm I'm not sure of this tbh, but I do know that women here in Malaysia atleast, face certain bars when trying to excel in their careers, as opposed to men. Things like being expected to do sexual favours for their bosses to get certain opportunities, having to go to extreme lengths to fit a beauty stabdard for a job that doesn't doesn't even have an emphasis on appearances, receiving lessser recognition for their achievements than men who achieved things of the same calibre, etc. I realise that the gender pay gap thing could be a choice thing, but you have to recognise that women (atleast in non-western countries) still have these things to face while trying to work. \n\n>That's what MRA means to me: Freedom instead of ideology. \n\nI think freedom can be achieved without ideology, however, the underlying mechanisms of why oppresive systems exist in the first place should be understood. That's where studying power hierarchies like the patriarchy and matriarchy comes into place. Most people assume that the patriarchy is part of feminist ideology (which it is) but it is also first and foremost, a sociological concept. I think MRA's could benefit from studying the underlying concepts too. But either way, whatever we label ourselves, striving for equality should be our main goal, not fighting each other and not trying to become the oppresor ourselves. \n\nBtw thank you for the addition to my post!",

The reason (priviliged) women in my country can receive an education, work and make their own choices is because of feminism. It has reduced rates of FGM, female infanticide, honor killings, stigma around puberty, rape, premarital sex, etc etc.\n\n>Or did it make women just more manly and non-feminine?\n\nI think it gave them the choice to express themselves however they wanted. If some want to express themselves and manly and non-feminine so be it. They aren't hurting anyone.\n\n>Also, most feminists I come across are depressed and purposeless, their Nialism drags them down a dark road.\n\nI don't think I'd call myself depressed or purposeless, altho I am very priviliged (my upbringing was healthy and I was far from oppressed). However, you need to understand that their depression, nihilism and anger could come from trauma, just the same as angry, depressed and nihilist MRAs. It isn't wrong to have feelings and trauma responses. \n\n>I think, feminism went wrong, when I tried to make women more manly and men more womenly.\n\nI think it went wrong in the sense that some women wanted to be in the place of their perceived oppressors (men) rather than be equal. This led to feminist movements throwing men under the bus in certain legal matters (like the child custody thing, rape allegations, etc). I understand that this could be a trauma response, but it's wrong. The original feminist goal was for equality (and I'm trying to emulate that in my country).\n\n>I don\u00b4t want a cold, battlehardened saleswomen or judge...

All the young girls will be single moms and actually think it's cool to be a $lut. \n\nAll the men will just been seen as sperm donors and a wallet to fund a lifestyle for the ex wife while she moves her boyfriend into the house that used to be his. \n\nGood luck because here in USA all the feminists are single, angry, childless with pink hair and complaining about the patriarchy. They are secretly attracted to the masculine conservative guys but they never will be able to marry them because the conservative women snatch up all the mentally and physically strong men. \n\nAlot of men here would rather find a woman from se Asia because they are feminine and agreeable. In the US women will battle over every little thing and very quickly become unhappy in the relationship, therefore they file for divorce 80% of the time.\n\nYou're saying how horrible it sounds yet you will gladly accept all of this in your own country.

Watch [this](https://youtu.be/-BYREt2r_uQ) video. Tell me who the \"real\" feminist is. Is the one being booed or cheered? Is it the one who's opinion is mainstream in media and academia, or is it the outcast who has spoken many times about what the feminist movement has become (I would argue that was really its true nature showing but still)?\n\nI'm still trying to decipher what the hell you mean by, \"Social system, not reality.\" What is that even supposed to mean? Society favours men over women, but the reality doesn't show it? What does that mean? Does it mean they failed? Are men so stupid and incompetent that they failed at oppressing women? Is that what you think?\n\nWhen feminists say patriarchy, they mean all of society, not parts of it. Just look at how they [talk about matriarchy](https://archive.ph/wip/rnHWw). They even [talk about patriarchy](https://www.blackagendareport.com/theory-101-patriarchy-structure-white-supremacist-class-rule-under-imperialism) in the same way. If they truly believed it was parts of it, why only talk about male privilege and not female privilege? Why only toxic masculinity and not toxic femininity? Why would feminists (including you) say, \"Patriarchy hurts men too.\" and never, \"Matriarchy hurts women too.\" if patriarchy theory described parts of society?\n\nhttps://www.thoughtco.com/patriarchal-society-feminism-definition-3528978\n\n>Patriarchal (adj.) describes a general structure in which men have power over women. Society (n.) is the entirety of relations of a community. A\u00a0patriarchal society\u00a0consists of a male-dominated power structure throughout organized society and in individual relationships.\n\n>Power is related to privilege.\u00a0In a system in which men have more power than women, men have some level of privilege to which women are not entitled.\n\nDoes that sound like, \"parts of society\" to you?\n\nhttps://organizingchange.org/patriarchy-persists-can-change/\n\n>Patriarchy impacts everyone, at all levels of society.\n\nDoes *this* sound like, \"parts of society\" to you?\n\n>This means, that people of all gender identities can perpetuate patriarchy, even if it is mainly male-identified individuals that reap most of the societal benefits.\n\nA clear idea in feminism of, \"Men have it better than women.\"\n\nDoes [this](https://youtu.be/yZYQpge1W5s?t=260) feminist sound like she's describing parts of society? Remember that Roxanne Gay video at the beginning of this comment? Does *she* sound like she's describing parts of society?\n\nSo don't demand I put your \"version\" of feminism above the biggest names in the movement, and don't play victim when I criticize you.\n\n>I've also come across some great MRAs on this sub who understood what I was saying and offered constructive criticism and arguments against it.\n\nThat's because they weren't talking about this. They were talking about other stuff.\n\nFrom [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/osh72a/about_the_patriarchy_and_how_it_causes_mens/h6u1tis?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):\n\n>I can't \"proove\" that the patriarchy exists since it is a sociological concept, and therefore, an observation that has been made and agreed upon by many (and since many people have different experiences, the definition can vary, but I provided the general consensus in my post). So simply put, it's an observation, which cannot be disproven or proven because it depends on collective experience.\n\nWhat the actual fuck? Seriously, what the fuck? What. The. Fuck. *What the fuck?* **WHAT THE FUCK?**\n\nHow in the fuck do you admit to an entire political movement organising around an unfalsifiable concept, and then suggest that's a *good thing*?

Men aren't the dominant force in society, society expects men to be dominant. I've already clarified in thale paragraph below the definition and provided a link to what a social system is. \n\nI also disagree that women have never been oppressed. The fact that some people are debating over it is a testament to how far their region has come from the olden days. Unfortunately, where I'm from, women's oppresion is ongoing and the fact that people are \"debating\" it's existence is pretty shocking to me. Female infanticide, honor killings, corrective rape, sexual coercion, forced marriages, etc all still exist and are not something to be \"debated\". \n\nNow the parts that I agree with. I agree that men can be oppressed, have faced great injustices in legal systems and the fact that the gender gap thing can be entirely up to choice. You're right on all accounts there. I want to add that while the gender gap stats may be non-causal, women still face some barriers in their career, atleast in non-western parts of the world  (like being expected to give sexual favours, having entirely different and inconvenient dress codes, having our achievements be compared or worse still, ignored eventhough they're on the same caliber as everyone else's, etc).\n\nI also agree that expecting an equality of outcomes is unfeasible because men and women are different. Most feminist that I know of (non-western ones) are aiming for an equality in terms of opportunities.\n\nBut anyway, your manifesto an interesting and comprehensive read! Thanks for linking it.",

The gendering of the term has definitely caused ALOT of confusion and blaming (and the whole \"who is oppressed\" \"who is the oppresor\" competition, which imo is detrimental to any effort to achieve equality). Tbh if I had been in charge of naming these things I wouldn't have made it gendered to avoid all that confusion. \n\n>feminists like to add a male suggesting prefix to the word?\n\nI think that if you look at it from a sociological perspective, you'd fine that most male centric words like patriarchy, toxic masculinity, etc have female versions of them. The reason why these female focussed words don't get more recognition could be because feminism has a female-centric view of these problems.",

Also men don't have consent in my country and females can't be perpetrators of rape which means female criminals of female on female rape are let go. Recently an Indian feminist activist raped a foreigner women and nothing happened to her. Also life time serving female prisoners are released just for being a woman. And female politicians have excluded men from DV and all kinds of abuse laws. If this doesn't scream gynocentrism you're deaf and blinded by the word patriarchy. I've seen @feminist on instagram 3-4 years ago and their comments were filled with KAM comments getting 2k-3k likes. The problem starts with first world country's privileged feminuts, they start something new to get clout and then Indian misandrists make a knock off of it like \"Brahminical Patriarchy\". The feminist movement as a whole does nothing for male victims instead trivialises and reduces their experiences with \"you must've enjoyed it\" \"it's the pAtRiArChY backfiring\". One thing I hate about feminuts and the feminist movement is that they think that they're the default victims of everything. It's funny to me because men and women both got rights on the same day in our country. I don't know what people outside think about India, cause many first world feminuts tried to educate me about my own country about how rape is so much prevalent here and that my country is filled with misogynist men. I don't like the gender wars like feminuts, but boys were 51% of child abuse victims and feminuts in my country even advocated for making child abuse laws gender specific. And if I start mentioning the biased court laws on marriage, you could make a textbook out of the atrocities of Feminism. There's something called dowry which used to happen decades ago, dowry is a crime now and married women take undue advantage of these laws as they please, my tutor lost half of his life savings in the first 6 months of marriage. Women here publicly beats up and thrashes a traffic police officer in broad day light and people only make videos out of it, now reverse the genders and watch the world burn. Feminism stole my basic human rights as a man and I hate this misandrist movement to it's very core.",

The strongest factor for these things is toxic masculinity (the act of conforming to gender stereotypes in an extreme, maladaptive way) which is a result of patriarchy (just the same as toxic femininity is). \n\n>women are seen as victims and men are seen as perpetrators ALWAYS, BECAUSE OF FEMINISM!\n\nI agree with you here. If it's any reassurance, I only think in terms of the rapist and victim, not male rapist and female victim. \n\n>Feminists fighting against \"patriarchy\", immediately sets a tone of women vs men.\n\nThis is because the feminist view of patriarchy is through a female-centric lens, due to the movement being dominated by women. Recently, the amount of men joining the movement has increased (atleast where I'm from there's a more balanced amount of men and women in the movement) and this female centrism isn't something we see there. There is a synonymous agreement to advocate for both men and women's rights.\n\n>it's defined by Wikipedia as a social system where men dominate certain positions in society but now it's being applied to issues such as cat calling.\n\nAgain, catcalling can also be attributed to toxic masculinity (the need to dominate someone and the disregard for consent).\n\n>Saying that things such as rape, sexual assault and cat calling are patriarchy by definition make it seem as MEN as a collective, not as specific individuals, propagate these things to \"oppress\" women.\n\nThe thing is, the concept of patriarchy isn't \"men are at fault\", that idea js simply propagated by people who are angry and trying to deal with trauma (not a justification, they are at fault for propagating this idea). Rape, sexual assaults, abuse and cat calling aren't because \"men are trash\" it's because of the patriarchy (that explains how men are expected to act this way by society). \n\n>Now that concept of oppression is being applied to men's treatment of women on a social level for issues such as catcalling. It makes no sense and it's frankly wrong because men as a group aren't doing these things.\n\nOppresion is simply something that a group of people lack, but that is granted to another group of people for superficial reasons. For example, when you walk down the street you don't really worry about being catcalled, which is a provilige that most women don't experience. In the same way, when a women is earning less than her counterpart, she isn't shamed for it, while a man is shamed for the exact same thing, making that man oppressed. Oppression comes in different forms and everyone has it because while society may have improved today compared to the time of Karl Marx, we are far from being perfect.\n\n>Men aren't setting up a system of cat calling, it's generally socially frowned upon, same with rape and SA.\n\nI agree that men aren't setting up the system. I disagree that cat calling is socially frowned upon. I mean, I assume in western countries it may be the case, but where I'm from, men are actively encouraged to stalk and threaten women.\n\n>Are you describing India?\n\nClose lol!

In the western world, what remains of this traditional patriarchy?\n\nSo as I stated in my post, I'm southeast Asian. I live in a very patriarchal society, and educated men and women (in my country) are trying very hard to overthrow this. So I honestly don't know how to answer this question because I can't imagine a society where traditional patriarchy has already been abolished. I assumed that western society still faces patriarchy because statistics tell me that rape/sexual assault still happens, male suicide is still high and women still get cat called. I don't live in the west though, this is all purely assumptions I made based on news I hear.\n\n>Women have equal rights to men, women can divorce their husbands for no reason, women can work, women can get abortions, women can get educated, woman can go wherever without a man's permission, woman can be in politics, law, business, finance, media, you name it, woman can choose who they marry, if they marry, and more.\n\nThese may be true for your country. Unfortunately, people around the world do not enjoy these things.\n\n>I think you're trying to oversimplify men's issues by interpreting them as a result of patriarchy instead of at least considering that feminism is responsible for some of the issues men are facing in western society today.\n\nI believe that toxic feminists (or let's just call them by what they really are: misandrists) contribute towards men's oppresion. There's also a lot of other factors but idk how actually feminist theory contributes to it. \n\n>Feminists created the Duluth Model which painted men as the only possible perpetrators in a domestic violence situation, leading to men who were being abused getting arrested when they were the ones who called the police.\n\n>Feminists have turned the conversation of sexual violence: sexual assault, rape, coercion, into a gender-based issue (Men as perpetrators, women as victims), disrespecting male victims with female perpetrators.\n\nThese are really good points, I can see how the feminist movement led to these things (in the west atleast). I haven't experienced these things personally because I come from a society where women are majorly oppressed, shamed and shunned. I believe that if a feminist movement were to start in my country based off of western feminist movements, it might end up like you are describing. That's why I try to advocate for both.\n\n>Feminists have manipulated statistics to suit their own anti-male agenda, e.g. gender pay gap which they still spew which has been debunked so many times. Feminists push for more rape convictions with no care for innocent men who are victims of false accusations. They misrepresent statistics on false accusations. They misrepresent what men say and shame them for speaking up, offering nuance and criticism and it's just become a toxic movement.\n\nThis however, I'm not so sure. Are there any sources to these?\n\n>Feminism is about power.\n\nI sincerely believe that only western (\"white\") feminism is about power. As you said, feminists of that time not only neglected men's issues, they also neglected racial issues (basically, white women demanded power over coloured women). This is still a hotly debated topic even today. What I think, is that the feminists of that times worked with what they had, and the feminists of this time, are working with what they have. It wasn't enough equality at that time, and it isn't enough equality this time. We are all just humans and we're all just trying.\n\nInstead of bashing an entire movement based on what happened in a certain reguon of the world, I urge you to look at it from a more global perspective. Feminism has helped countless Asian countries to stop killing their baby girls while they are still fetuses, urged them to stop selling child brides, urged them to stop FGM and urged them to send their girls to work/vote. And this is just in urban areas. People in rural asian regions still do these atrocities! I'm not saying men have it better either, with young boys being urged to marry, work in factories, be kicked out of their homes for wanting to study, etc. But that is the fate of developing, post colonial countries. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, look at all these positives that feminism gave us? Every movement has its flaws, so we focus on the benefits and try to fix those flaws! But anyway, my post isn't advocating for feminism, it's advocating for equality. And whether that means men's rights or women's rights to you (depending on where you're from) then who cares about labels as long as you strive towards that?",

Male psychology moves us towards a more scientific and balanced understanding of the \u00adpsychology of men and of boys, drawing on a range of perspectives, and away from an overreliance on social constructionism and preoccupations with notions such as patriarchy and privilege, too often seen in the narrative about men.\n\nIn Perspectives in Male Psychology: An Introduction, two of the most prominent authors in this new field, Louise Liddon and John Barry, introduce and deliver an insightful exploration of some of today\u2019s most hotly contested issues regarding men and masculinity.\n\nThis book puts forward a balanced perspective that has been missing from academic and media narratives around topics such as child development, education, sport and exercise, the workplace, crime, the military, health and wellbeing, mental health, therapy, masculinity, and sex differences, and considers the role that evolution, biology, and culture play in shaping male behavior.\n\nThis book will also help readers to better understand some key issues such as:\n\nWhy there are controversies around sex differences research\nHow bias in research has led to a distorted view of the psychology of men and boys\nThe ways in which the mental health and other needs of men and boys are routinely overlooked\nIn turn this helps us ask some important questions such as:\n\nIf there are more similarities than differences between men and women, does that mean the differences are unimportant?\nHow can we un-distort our understanding of men and masculinity?\nWhat are the best ways of identifying and meeting the psychological needs of men and boys?\nReaders, whether students or lecturers, will also benefit from the inclusion of our companion Wiley website containing additional resources to support the development of knowledge and understanding of male psychology.\n\nPerfect for undergraduate and graduate students in psychology, medicine, and sociology, as well as established professionals in these and related fields, Perspectives in Male Psychology: An Introduction will also earn a place in the libraries of anyone interested in the psychology of sex and gender differences in various aspects of mental health and human behaviour.\n\nThis Handbook represents the first concerted effort to understand male mental health in a way that facilitates a positive step forward in both theory and treatment. An alarming number of men experience serious mental health issues, as demonstrated by high rates of suicide and violent offending. Despite these problems, the study of male psychology has either been overlooked, or viewed as a problem of defective masculinity. This handbook brings together experts from across the world to discuss men\u2019s mental health, from prenatal development, through childhood, adolescence, and fatherhood. Men and masculinity are explored from multiple perspectives including evolutionary, cross-cultural, cognitive, biological, developmental, and existential viewpoints, with a focus on practical suggestions and demonstrations of successful clinical work with men.\n\nThroughout, chapters question existing models of understanding and treating men\u2019s mental health and explore new approaches, theories and interventions. This definitive handbook encapsulates a new wave of positive theory and practice in the field of male psychology and will be of great value to professionals, academics, and those working with males through the lifespan in any sector related to male mental health and wellbeing. \nFrom the Back Cover\nThis Handbook represents the first concerted effort to understand male mental health in a way that facilitates a positive step forward in both theory and treatment.

Unfortunately, most discourse surrounding these matters have to use such terms because almost every term is frought with uncertainty and disagreement. Heck even the term gender roles is still a debated point!\n\n>For example, look up the duluth model and how feminist theory was a large underpinning of it. This is a primary model of domestic violence that views DV as gendered created by feminists that has caused a great deal of harm for male victims of domestic violence in terms of access of resources and inclusion in public policy about family violence.

For example, stopping male genital mutilation, more services for male victims of DV, more discussion/support and research for male mental health, looking into boys falling behind in education, passing laws and changing the policy to make things more equal for men in family court, etc. When you look at the actions of feminists in the real world, they simply fail to do these things that MRAs generally want to actually fix.\n\nI think this is because the western feminist movement is very female-centric (altho since I'm not from the west, this is just as assumption).

I'm happy you believe in equality. However, i still don't think its necessary to have to discuss and advocate for gender issues through the lens of feminist theory.

I think it's important to look at it from different perspectives. When I first learned about the patriarchy, it wasn't from a feminist point of view. I learned about it in my social psychology subject (I'm a psychology student), which is why I'm more well versed in looking at these problems from that pov. Thank you for your input!",

I don't think MRAs would disagree with the fact that traditional gender expectations are an issue that we should work against. You don't have to call that patriarchy. Especially when feminist theory often makes the mistake of thinking that all gender roles are products of socialization rather than coming from anything innate. I personally believe in the nuanced view that some of it is socialization and some is innate. Feminists think that patriarchy is what creates gender roles and if we just \"smash the patriarchy\" we will solve the problems. However, it could be the case that the biological differences in men and women naturally is a large cause of WHY we organize in the system of patriarchy in the first place. There is a lot of honest debate to be had about all of that still and can get a bit complicated. I don't think we know how much is \"nature\" and how much is \"nurture\". \n\nAnother issue with the \"fight the patriarchy\" thing , is that the issues men face are far more complicated than just this overly simplistic solution of \"smash the patriarchy\". Think about this, when we wanted to solve issues for women, it wasn't as simple as fighting the patriarchy on the internet and telling you friends your against the patriarchy. It was taking action and actually fixing the issues that women have, with social change, and often law and policy. Like making more domestic abuse shelters, passing equal pay laws, banning female genital mutilation, etc.\n\nA big disconnect I often see with MRA and feminist discourses, is that feminists want to say we should \"fight the patriarchy\" and that's just the end of the conversation.

Your opinion based on this is complete valid.\n\n>But no.. it's \"Everything is the fault of Patriarchy\" and regardless of the definition you give.. people will not understand which definition you are using.. they will conflate Patriarchy with - Men rule.. there fore men = the problem..\n\nI explained why exactly peoppe assumed this and why it's wrong! Men do not rule, men are *expected* to rule. This is detrimental to everyone, including men themsleves.\n\n>If feminism cared for equality.. they wouldn't be protesting conferences around male suicide.. the fact that they do clearly means they don't care about equality..\nOr Genital Mutilation.. instead of striving for equality feminists pushed and pushed to make FGM (Female Genital Mutilation) illegal.. when they could have just made it illegal to have ANYONE'S genitals mutilated..\n\nThis is a great point. You're very right here. Unfortunately, as all movements do, feminism has its flaws. \n\n>And yet we have feminists who seem quite happy to declare the opposite as true.. where any and ALL men are 'Privileged' and are happy to point this out without knowing anything about your history..\nYou could have grown up in abject poverty, worked hard to get a degree and the job you have but instead of it being because of hard work its instead chalked up to you being 'privileged'\n\nI think that your exposure to toxic feminists has made you under a very different definition of Privilige. Privilige isn't something to be ashamed of, it's something that you simply have. It isn't your fault, and it doesn't mean you are automatically oppressing others. A women has Privilige over a man in aspects of family, while a man is oppressed in that, in the same way that a man has Privilige in his career, while a woman is oppressed in that.\n\n>Hint: Its WOMEN who make false accusations against men.. not the other way around.. it's WOMEN whom are taking advantage of the court bias to get revenge, abuse or get attention.. Men are more likely to be seen as \"Rapists' because when men DO come forward they are either laughed at or told that they must have enjoyed it..\n\nYou're right. It's also men who are most likely to be serial killers (statistically), yet I can't assume all men do so because it's a huge, unjustified generalisation. I agree that the women who claim false rape allegations are assholes.\n\n>Not only that but in many countries the law makes it quite clear that men and ONLY men can be convicted of rape.. This is because in the definition of the crime it requires Penetration of Person A by Person B's Genitals.. and being that men are the only ones who have genitals that can 'penetrate' the law is clear that men can rape women or men.. but women can not be found guilty of rape.\n\nThis is also an issue that needs to be resolved! I agree that this is a huge injustice as well.\n\n>A lot of this is thanks to feminists who have fought hard to have the definition of 'Rape' changed in their favor btw..\n\n>At the end of the day if you believe in equality then the best label is 'egalitarian' this is a nice gender neutral label which means \"I stand for equality\"\n\nAs you said in the beginning of your comment, your experience with feminist has led you to have a negative opinion of them, and thus you chose this label. My experience has been the opposite, thus my label to be a feminist. I think despite both our different labels, we can agree that we both have middle ground in advocating for equality!

Let's break this down: The notion of men having primary power does not mean that all men are privileged\n\nAnd yet we have feminists who seem quite happy to declare the opposite as true.. where any and ALL men are 'Privileged' and are happy to point this out without knowing anything about your history..  \nYou could have grown up in abject poverty, worked hard to get a degree and the job you have but instead of it being because of hard work its instead chalked up to you being 'privileged'\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>false rape/assault allegations: The fact that this issue isn't getting   \ndiscussed more is baffling. False rape allegations are basically people   \nwho are taking advantage of the assumption that men are more likely to   \nbe in the role of rapist/assaulter because the patriarchy deems men as   \n\"dominant\", which is synonymous with violent/aggresive. While   \nstatistically, men are more likely to be in this role (which could be   \ndue to low rates of reporting by male victims), to make the assumption   \non an individual (especially in legal matters) is an injustice.\n\nNot to be that guy.. but take a look at just WHO are the people making the false accusations?  \nHint: Its **WOMEN** who make false accusations against men.. not the other way around.. it's **WOMEN** whom are taking advantage of the court bias to get revenge, abuse or get attention.. Men are more likely to be seen as \"Rapists' because when men DO come forward they are either laughed at or told that they must have enjoyed it..\n\nNot only that but in many countries the law makes it quite clear that men and **ONLY** men can be convicted of rape.. This is because in the definition of the crime it requires Penetration of Person A by Person B's Genitals.. and being that men are the only ones who have genitals that can 'penetrate' the law is clear that men can rape women or men.. but women can not be found guilty of rape.\n\nA lot of this is thanks to feminists who have fought hard to have the definition of 'Rape' changed in their favor btw..\n\nAt the end of the day if you believe in equality then the best label is 'egalitarian' this is a nice gender neutral label which means \"I stand for equality\"",

For example, the idea that men can't or aren't victims of things such as domestic violence of rape to the extent that women are isn't strictly because of patriarchy, it's largely because of feminist researchers like Mary P. Koss conducting studies in which they define \"rape\" in such a way as to exclude male victims (until 2013 the definition of rape used in statistics was \"the carnal knowledge of a female against her will\"), classify the rape of men as \"made to penetrate,\" and then report that rape was a crime overwhelmingly committed by men against women. \n\nFeminists like Katherine Spillar would say things like \"domestic violence is just a clean-up word for wife beating. It isn't girls who are beating up on boys, it's. boys who are beating up on girls.\" Feminists like Michael Paymar created the Duluth Model, the most widely used model for addressing domestic violence, which treats men as perpetrators and women as victims. It describes perpetrating male privilege as one of the key drivers in domestic violence. \n\nMurray A Strauss has conducted research that found that women were the aggressors in DV at least as often as men, and that they have the same motivations as men, and that when women commit DV, it is very rarely out of self-defense. Michael Paymar addressed Strauss' research by saying that he was aware that he had found women to be just as violent as men, but that it was different because women committed domestic violence out of self-defense. Trust me, I was fuming when I heard him utter that flat out lie.\n\nIt isn't patriarchy that decided that women should be the ones to get custody of the children. It used to be that men were given custody since they were financially responsible for the children, that was changed with the Tender Years Doctrine after Caroline Norton pushed for it after loosing access to her kids after her divorce. However while the doctrine switched rights to the children from the father to the mother, it still left the financial responsibility with the father. More recently, the National Organization for Women has consistently lobbied against legislation legislation that would have brought more equal shared parenting. They even did it twice in Florida by convincing the governor to veto such legislation that had passed both the house and senate with bipartisan support and overwhelming support from the general population. \n\nThese are the actions of FEMINISTS, not some spooky patriarchy.

That doesn't mean there's no room for improvement still.\n\nBut you want to stop that huge improvement to the world's living standards. You want to tear the system apart and destroy it.

You cannot be a feminist if you disagree with such a core principle of feminism that men dominate women and control society.\n\n>...the global poverty rates have not been \"almost eradicated\". They have decreased, but there are still entire regions who are poverty stricken...\n\nLet us first not quote me out of context, eh? Let's look at what I *actually* said: \"global poverty levels have almost been eradicated by the standards of when I was a young man.\"  \nIf I have muddy boots and clean most of it off, leaving a smudge here and there, then I will have mostly eradicated the dirt. It is irrelevant to that statement that there is more to do.\n\nThere are indeed regions which still need effort. Mostly these are in war zones, which always makes it difficult to help, or in areas of recent natural disaster, where it always takes a while for a society to get back on its feet. Nevertheless, we are working hard on improvement wherever we can (Covid and Ebola haven't helped). More than regional problems, are discriminatory ones, most notably against men, against the aged, and against people with a minority religion or skin colouring.\n\nTo deny that - GLOBALLY - poverty has not been almost eradicated is to discredit the incredible progress and effort made over recent decades. And yet the policies you support would not only want to deny the many millions who have been lifted out of poverty, but put a halt to the progress and then reverse it.",

All I am trying to say is their are \"peculiarities\" and the theory should be modified to acknowledge that. \n\n>I think you're describing gynocentrism?\n\nNo, I think we are delving into semantics here though. From wikipedia\r  \n\n\n\"Gynocentrism is a dominant or exclusive focus on women in theory or practice; or to the advocacy of this.\\[1\\] Anything can be considered gynocentric when it is concerned exclusively with a female (or feminist) point of view.\"\r  \n\n\nThis is independent of definitions of power (and society give value) and in some situations an exclusive focus on women occurs because of how devalued women/femininity is. \n\n\r\n\n>Expectations of power means certain expectations of other traits, such as leadership, aggresiveness, stoicness and material ownerships. Associating maleness with all these things deprives women of their own autonomy in these areas. Meanwhile, femaleness is associated with submission to that primary power, which entails expectations like reproduction, emotion/expression and family. Women hold power over men in these aspects, depriving men of their autonomy too.\n\nDefining a patriarchy in this way, power is associated with \"leadership, aggresiveness, stoicness\". A matriarchy is simply the reverse, defining power as associated with \"reproduction, emotion/expression and family\"... using your examples. Society defines what is or isn't associated with power.\n\n>I was under the assumption though, that gynocentrism is a problem that is far less extensive than patriarchy\n\nI agree, I am not trying to debate the severity of mens vs womens issues. I agree that patriarchal structures are more widespread/severe on global scale. \n\n>I'm assuming they simply acted like they were abive you because they were able to be more emotional, in which case, that's bad and defo not what dismantling the patriarchy should have ended up in.\n\nI agree, but\n\n> Being stoic and emotionless? Isn't that better for your overall health though?\n\nThey had that same mentality, and they were imposing their belief structure on me. \n\n>imposing it, we aren't exactly endangering anyone's lives\n\nare we? their are ways to \"dismantle the patriarchy\" without endangering anyone's lives. But imposing ones views on emotional expressiveness onto a suicidal man absolutely did. And many individuals feel that is one way to \"dismantle the patriarchy\".\n\nTLDR\n\nI agree with you that patriarchal structures are real, prevalent and dangerous. Labeling all of society as a patriarchy is a generalization that erases the experiences of \"peculiarities\". And invalidating the experiences of individuals absolutely has a negative impact. \n\nEdit\nWhether or not you deem that impact sufficient to warrant change, as you said, imposing it isn't endangering anyone lives, you inadvertently stepped to the core complaint of many men on this sub.",

A generalisation is a statement that tries to sum up an entire group of people based on perceived similarities, and I usually done by one person. You're right that it can have some basis in reality, but overly relying on it can lead to negative stereotypes, and prejudice. On the other hand, a collective observation done by sociologists (I should have added this earlier), is as unbiased as can be (because it's a literal requirement for a scientific field), and tries to fit reality as much as possible. In short, a collective observation by professionals is more reliable than a generalization done by just anyone.\n\n>So is it appropriate to say I live in a patriarchy, when I didn't experience said patriarchal expectations?\n\nThis is an interesting take, but often, people are unaware of the patriarchy in their life (not trying to discredit you experience tho I'm just speculating). You are on a men's rights sub so you must have experienced some form of oppression, and according to the concept I explained in the post, that oppresion must have arisen from patriarchy. If it didn't, then you're right, you don't live in a patriarchal society, in which case congrats! But unless you can safely say that MOST of society hasn't experienced patriarchy (which is untrue) then a generalization should be made that social systems are still patriarchal, but your surrounding social network is in the process of having broken away (or has already finished the process) because it discredits the experience of a majority to say that society isn't patriarchal anymore. \n\nOr, it could also come down to what we perceive. You could safely say that you don't live in a patriarchal society, because that is what you've experienced, as opposed to me, because I do live in a patriarchal society. The bigger problem I think, is to discredit is existence, as opposed to imposing it on someone, because by imposing it, we aren't exactly endangering anyone's lives because you are already free of the patriarchal values, but discrediting it is dangerous for the people who still aren't.\n\n>Matriarchal structures are ones that value \"feminine\" traits and devalue \"masculine\". It wouldn't be simply taking masculine traits and making them feminine. So value (and subsequently power) would be given to, using your examples \"(emotion, family, nurturing and weakness)\" and devalue traits (requiring those who exhibit said traits to \"submit\" to the ones with the \"valued\" traits), again using your examples \"(strength, aggresion, dominance and leadership)\"\n\nI think you're describing gynocentrism? As someone from an Indian family, I've experienced both gynocentrism and patriarchy side by side lol! Both are definitely not mutually exclusive. Both are just as bad as each other. I was under the assumption though, that gynocentrism is a problem that is far less extensive than patriarchy (with the rate of people getting killed for it being less). Can you provide any examples of your own experiences with it?\n\n>But a better one is that it is a consequence of a societies needs and subsequently what it values. If a society is under threat of war, the traits associated with defending against that threat will increase in value. But in times of peace that value will erode. Also as war evolves, like from using swords (requiring things like physical strength and size) to technology like missiles and drones (requiring things like intelligence) those valued traits will change. So I think a better phrase than \"a natural consequence of biological difference\" is a natural consequence of situational needs favoring certain biological and cultural differences. So I would disagree that it would be \"unnatural\". As a society changes what it values will naturally change.\n\nOh I definitely agree with this! \n\n>the reverse was devalued\n\nThe reverse? Being stoic and emotionless? Isn't that better for your overall health though? Altho ofcourse, that depends on what you mean by devalue. If they responded negatively by shaming you for your reactions, than I'd say that's bad. If they responded negatively by discouraging your response an encouraging emotional vulnerability, then I'd say it's good?\n\n>Those who didnt embody this trait were expected to \"submit\" to the \"emotional intelligence\" (the power) of those who did.\n\nAgain, not sure what this means but it sounds pretty bad. I'm assuming they simply acted like they were abive you because they were able to be more emotional, in which case, that's bad and defo not what dismantling the patriarchy should have ended up in.",

Most generalizations have some basis in reality, like women want to date \"taller stronger men\". However you had a problem with that statement because it erases \"peculiarities\".

People often imagine \"dropping gender roles\" means every man has to be feminine and every women has to be masculine because that destroyed gender roles completely. That notion is untrue, because it would give rise to a new set of gender roles, one where masculinity is associated with feminine traits and vice versa. The reality of \"dropping gender roles\" it to stop assumptions and have a freedoms of choice over our actions instead of doing something simply because it's expected of us. For example, a man can simply choose to be the breadwinner, or a househusband, without worrying about what's expected of him by society. The same goes for s woman.",

It is nonsense to say that men are simply given power.\n\nYour link to a UN source says nothing about levels of violence against men, the UN rarely bother with such matters. The link does not support your contention that women are subject to more violence than men.\n\n> Can I know the reason for your rather abrupt dismissal? Why exactly is it based on false assumptions? What are these false assumptions?\n\nMen do not have social privilege nor is there any right to own property that men have and women do not. Your cited definition of patriarchy therefore does not apply to any First World country.\n\n> Women like this are assholes. \n\nYou are calling all women assholes. It is innate that they dislike wimps. Whatever they say there is no contest between a well built masculine man and a sensitive weedy type. Men who try to be sensitive in order to attract women get burned. In Asia, Africa and the Western World.\n\n> not all women and pregnant or have children\n\nNo, but sexual attraction evolved to make child rearing successful.\n\n> I'm a women lol, believe me I do not expect my SO to be stronger than I am.\n\nI don't believe you, even if you believe yourself, and I don't expect your relationship to last because you are deceiving yourself. When things don't work out the way you expected, I have no doubt you will feel that it is his fault.\n\n> And as a society, I'd expect that we are past the necessity for these gender roles as not everyone are focussed on families.\n\nSuch utopianism will not end well.\n\n> As you can see, your example shows perfectly, how both women and men are oppressed.\n\nNo, it refers to men doing the hardest, and worst jobs. This is in no way the oppression of women.\n\n> Damn. Please look at the statistics of how many people don't have these things.\n\nVery few in capitalist countries. Over the whole world, there are far more people who are overfed than underfed. This has been the case for several decades now, and the huge reduction in world poverty is almost entirely due to India and China moving on from impractical ideas of social engineering and adopting instead free market capitalism.

It's everyone. Your friends who bully you for being skinny, your family members who ask why you gained so much weight at functions. The patriarchy is all around you. Blaming women alone would be like those women who blame men alone for sexism.

This kind of inconsistency is not it.\n\nAs with any sociological theory, I imagine that there are many versions and disagreements, because after all, people have different social experiences. To sum all of it up into one theory is impossible seeing that social networks vary from region to region, heck even person to person. I tried to use the Wikipedia definition to avoid seeming biased but many people diagreed with that too. I can't please everyone but I tried hard to put my perspective into this post! \n\n>And frankly, this whole \"fighting the patriarchy\" has not yielded any real life benefits for us.\n\nI think it has! For one, people are believing in stereotypes less and less. I think more progress has been made on female rights issues as opposed to make rights issues though. For example, women aren't expected to be housewives and actually have a choice in their careers, marriages and bodies (not everyone, I'm afraid many women in my country do not have these but globally, the situation has improved). However, men are still expected to be the breadwinners, be physically fit and be masculine (any show of \"feminine\" traits like emotional expression is frowned upon). This is also a global thing I think. So yeah, the reason why fighting the patriarchy hasn't worked is because feminists are looking at it from a female-centric POV. I'm trying to change that! This discussion seemed a good place to start.\n\n>And feminism is far more than simply a label. It is a movement, and a powerful one at that, using it's influence to change legislation and implement policies, many which come at our expense. To claim to be feminist means you align yourself with said movement. \n\nYou're right in a way. The feminist movement in Malaysia is far from the western feminist movement however. When I claim that I am feminist, it simply means that I agree with feminist theory, not the actions of the feminists who came before me. I acknowledge that the movement has been detrimental to men's rights in certain ways, but I also acknowledge that it has improved living conditions for those of us living in post colonial countries. I'm trying to move forward and make the movement what it was meant to be: striving for equality. \n\n> It's more than just the US where we face these struggles.\n\nYes I've defo seen that men don't have it great here either. That's another reason why the feminist movement is different in Malaysia. We strive to introduce feminist concepts in a way that includes all, regardless of gender. So far, we've had movements for men's mental health (but in a country where suicide is literally illegal, you can imagine that this is hard). It's very low-key so far, but hey we're trying!",

        "body": "Hi everyone as the title says I'm a feminist looking to have a friendly debate/discussion. I'm not here to scream \"Y'ALL ARE WRONG MEN SHOULD DIE\" so I hope y'all don't do the same at me lol! (Seriously though, rude comments will be ignored). Fair warning that English is not my first language. I am also not well versed in US politics or issues since I am from southeast Asia. This is going to be a long post so TLDR at the bottom!\n\nSo I've been looking through this subreddit out of curiosity, and *I think my biggest issue is that y'all deny that men's rights issues do not stem from patriarchy (and I want to argue against that).* \nI'm looking for (constructive) input and different perspectives!\n\n**Let's establish what's patriarchy first** . The wikipedia definition is very straightforward: [Patriarchy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy) is a social system in which men hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property. (Some people have said that Wikipedia isn't a reliable source but I wanted to be unbiased and Wikipedia has the most agreed upon definition).\n\n**Contrary to popular belief, the concept of patriarchy does NOT mean that ALL men are the oppressors who hold power, or that ALL women are oppressed**. Let's break this down: The expectation of men to have primary power does not mean that they are privileged, infact it means the opposite. [Expectations of power means certain expectations of other traits, such as leadership, aggresiveness, stoicness and material ownerships. Associating maleness with all these things deprives women of their own autonomy in these areas. Meanwhile, femaleness is associated with submission to that primary power, which entails expectations like reproduction, emotion/expression and family. Women hold power over men in these aspects, depriving men of their autonomy too](https://open.maricopa.edu/culturepsychology/chapter/stereotypes-and-gender-roles/). \n\nSo do men actually hold primary power? NO they are **expected** to. Remember that the patriarchy is describing a social system, not a \"hard truth\". So are men responsible for patriarchy? NO! Is everyone responsible for upholding patriarchal values? YES! \n\n**So why do most feminists ignore this fact and seem to advocate for women alone?** Statistically, [men are known to be more violent than woman](https://nypost.com/2019/01/16/the-scientific-reasons-why-men-are-more-violent-than-women/), which makes people focus on women's issues, as they are perceived as more oppressed. Men's issues are neglected because [they don't occur at the same frequency](https://globalnews.ca/news/1221021/women-more-likely-to-be-victims-of-violent-crimes-study/) or have the same marketability, as violent crimes against women (which also makes a much more sensationalist headline). [This isn't to say women can't be violent too](https://www.domestic-violence-law.com/blog/2016/april/women-or-men-who-usually-instigates-domestic-vio/), it simply means that people perceive men to be more violent due to largely reported numbers. \n\nSo looking at the concept of patriarchy from a female-centric view (by focussing on women's issues alone) throws men who are oppressed by that same patriarchy, under the bus. This isn't a contest and we should not focus on who is more oppressed. **Ultimately, both women and men experience certain priviliges and oppresions due to patriarchy.**\n \nNow there's been ALOT of bashing against the concept of patriarchy in this subreddit because it's a huge part of feminist theory. I completely understand that many people on here do not agree with feminism because if their experiences with feminists, and that's totally valid. However, it should be worth noting that feminist theory should not be judged so quickly based on a bunch of people on the internet trending the hashtag #menaretrash. I can assure y'all that the people who say this are either not well versed in feminist theory or displacing their aggresion that's stemming from trauma (I'm not justifying their actions here, simply offering an explanation, their actions are wrong). I call myself \"feminist\" because I agree with the [concepts behind the theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_theory), not because I advocate for women alone and i\nI try not too look at these concepts from a female-centric perspective (Hence, this post to understand your perspectives).\n\nThe concept of patriarchy isn't just a part of feminist theory though, and as many people seem to assume, it's not a concept that's been \"made up\" by feminists and only supported by anectodal evidence. It is a [sociological concept](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_system) first and foremost, meaning that it is a theory that sums up patterns of social interactions that has been observed within society and studied by many! And yes, theories change overtime, especially sociological theories because society changes over time. \n\n**So what does patriarchy have to do with men's rights?**  Everything! As I pointed out before, [the patriarchy reinforces gender roles (maleness is associated with leadership, aggresion, stoicness, material ownership, etc while femaleness is associated with submission, reproduction, family, emotion, expression, etc)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1984-23015-001). Historically speaking, gender roles stem from our biological differences, but in the age where we have technology to make up for our short comings, whether man or woman, we are equally capable, rendering gender roles as a biproduct of social systems rather than a necessity. \n\n**Let me give a few examples of men's issues that has commonly been discussed in this subreddit and how the patriarchy is behind them**:\n\n\u2022 men not receiving child custody: [the patriarchal society views women (femininity) as more suited towards caring for young, making people lean towards granting women child custody as opposed to a man.](https://secularpatriarchy.wordpress.com/2013/10/09/the-rationale-of-father-custody-under-coverture/) This usually means they grant it to the women (regardless of how fit she is to actually take care of the child) and assume that the man will neglect or abuse the child, or will be an incompetent parent, which is unjustified.\n\n\u2022 men getting abused/assaulted: [the patriarchal society views men as dominant, and thus, violent/aggresive/strong and capable of protecting themselves.](http://www.hiddenhurt.co.uk/male_victims_of_domestic_violence.html) They are also perceived to be unaffected by trauma because being emotional is seen as a feminine trait. So people struggle to grasp that men can be abused/assaulted and suffer trauma from such an incident in the first place. Furthermore, men are perceived to more likely BE in the role of an abuser. This also factors in on my next point.\n\n\u2022 false rape/assault allegations: The fact that this issue isn't getting discussed more is baffling. False rape allegations are basically people who are taking advantage of the assumption that men are more likely to be in the role of rapist/assaulter because the patriarchy deems men as \"dominant\", which is synonymous with violent/aggresive. There's also the case of a self-fulfilling prophecy, in which [rapists are morely likely to be men](https://medium.com/@annetteinafrica/all-men-are-potential-rapists-399176050f3) (regardless of whether the victim is a women or a man) due to patriarchal expectations of dominance and violence. While [statistically, men are more likely to be in this role as opposed to the numbers of false rape allegations recorded](https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-men-are-more-likely-to-be-raped-than-be-falsely-accused-of-rape), it is still a gross injustice that should be addressed.\n\n\u2022 suicide rates among men: the patriarchal society expects men to be \"strong\" and dominant, and the assumption is made that external events would not affect them (and even if they did, men are expected to hide them and be expressionless). This makes men themselves repress emotions, stunting emotional growth and making them prone to mental illness. It also [makes their mental issues undiagnosed (ignored or ridiculed), making them less likely to even seek help in the first place](https://www.verywellmind.com/men-and-suicide-2328492).\n\n\u2022 men's body image: another issue that's should be discussed but society decides to gloss over. We see plus size models of women in magazines all the time (and this is a great thing!) but never of men (not so great). The assumption that men should be strong comes with the [expectations for men to be physically fit, and not just in a way that seems you healthy but in an extreme way to fit the mold of beauty](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/lets-have-a-frank-talk-about-male-body-image-kpkn/) (this perception is based on the assumption that the man has to please the submissive women with his dominance). As you can see, this leads to body image issues, insecurity, eating disorders and more mental illnesses. \n\n\u2022 men are expected to provide for the family and earn more than the women: [Men find themselves falling into the role of \"leader\" because of the centuries long expectation of being the breadwinner, regardless of whether he likes it or is capable of it.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1759-5436.12064) It is expected by everyone around him, that he provides for the family. But if he earns less than, or even equal to his wife, he is seen as incapable of \"supporting the family\", eventhough both men and women have the opportunities to earn for the family (it has to be pointed out here that in most countries, women are not priviliged enough to work, which actually reinforces the role of a man as primary provider. All in all, it's not a fun situation for both of them). \n\nAs I pointed out in my last point, notice how certain priviliges enjoyed by man is stemming from the oppresion of women. Notice how the women enjoys priviliges stemming from a man's oppresion. These things are interconnected, and that's what the patriarchy tries to describe. This is what systemic sexism is. It should be noted that oppresion isn't the fault of a priviliged person, but the fault of the societal system (patriarchy), which stems from the values upheld by ALL of society. **So instead of playing the blame game, why not focus on dismantling it?**\n\nHow you ask? Well first, by accepting generalisations for what they are: generalisations. Treating stereotypes like facts is what got us here. Let's allow people to make their own choices instead of placing expectations on them to conform to patriarchal values. This means that it's completely up to the person whether they want to conform to a gender stereotype (such as a man wanting to work in risky careers or a women wanting to be a housewife). The difference is that they CHOOSE this and aren't pressured into it. It also gives people the freedom to choose otherwise (such as a man wanting to be a househusband or a woman wanting to follow risky career paths). Equality isn't about equal distribution of roles among different genders (ie. Same number of men in STEM fields as women) but about equal opportunities (both men and women having the capability to choose their career path without any hindrances).\n\nAnyway, this is all I can think off the top of my head so far. Please feel free to mention any men's issue I missed so I can explain further! **Btw, I'm not asking anyone to \"change into a feminist\"**. Whether you choose to advocate for women's rights or men's rights is entirely based on your surroundings and experiences, and only our common goal to achieve equality matters. If we can sort out our differences (civilly) and agree on this common goal, then we can focus on the means of reaching it together.\n\nThank you for taking your time to read until here :)\n\n**TL, DR: the patriarchy isn't what you think it is and it's the source of both female and male right's issues in *most of society (see my 2nd edit)*. So we should stop with associating labels (feminist/men's rights activist) with generalized characteristics. Let's just strive towards equality.**\n\n\nEdit: I've added sources for people asking for \"proof of the patriarchy\". Again, I want to reiterate that this is a theory/concept that has been studied under sociological and psychological fields so I encourage y'all to search it up and learn more. I admit that feminists often look at these concepts from a female-centric perspective, but the scientific research behind it is unbiased (because that's literally a requirement for scientific studies). I also realise now that labels (like \"feminist\") can be powerful and that the modern feminist movement hasn't brought favourable benefits for everyone. However, [I can't deny the benefits that it has brought to others all over the world](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-007-9272-7), and want to continue identifying as a feminist so that I can stand behind the concepts of feminism to advocate for both men's and women's issues.\n\nTo the the people who provided constructive criticism, unbiased discussion and different perspectives, thank you. Y'all were awesome and I learned a lot :)\n\nEdit 2: it's come under my attention that some people may be part of social networks that have already dismantled patriarchy, but has some other form of power hierarchy (like the matriarchy). While this is an issue that's less widespread compared to patriarchal social networks, I realize that describing ALL of society as a patriarchy is detrimental to dealing with issues that people in a matriarchy face. So my conclusion: **We need to dismantle all forms of power hierarchies (patriarchal or matriarchal) to truly be equal**. To the people who say that power hierarchies are \"not bad\", consider the possibility that you enjoy more priviliges from that system than others do.",

There is plenty of sexism coming from feminists everywhere, so there is plenty to call out. \n\nIf you're conveniently ignoring or even denying all the feminist hypocrisy while claiming that \"we feminists are working on men's problems\", then you're not in the same boat. With \"friends\" like that, who needs enemies?\n\nIf you're demanding that everyone who fights for equality MUST do so while identifying as feminist, then you're not in the same boat. Mainstream feminist theories such as patriarchy are debatable because there are serious problems with the evidence. You cannot demand that MRA's cooperate with you because \"we're all for equality\" and then demand that they don't question your flawed theories, which have nothing to do with equality (on the contrary!)\n\nThe reality is that both sexes had a raw deal in the past, bar a small majority of rich and powerful men and women. Historically women were denied freedom (as described by feminists) but men were denied compassion - and in many cases, they were also denied freedom. Men were considered disposable enough to die in war, to give up their seats in lifeboats for the more valuable women, etc. Women in England during WO1 ran a shame campaign against men who weren't wearing uniforms to force them into their \"duty as men\" (read: male gender role) of dying for them (look up the \"white feather movement\"). Despite such evidence, feminism considers the raw deal of women worse than men, and holds men as a class responsible for the whole system. That's patriarchy theory. But if men really were in power, why would they as a class set up a system that undervalues their own lives and treats their own class as disposable? How could women in WO1 shame men into becoming soldiers against their will?\n\ntl;dr Mainstream feminism considers the two genders to be equal, but one to be more equal than the other.

But it's interesting to me that feminists, who have studied these issues for fifty years and written extensively on them, are almost entirely incapable of recognizing their own sexism.\n\nWell, I don't know if \"interesting\" is the word. Incredible, maybe. Outrageous. Intolerable. Disgusting?",

So before this situation gets out of hand let me try to explain how we see it. 1) Feminists say that patriarchy is (largely) oppresses women. Patriarchy is the theory that states that men (are or should be) unilaterally in charge. Since the theory says that the men are in charge and benefiting from the patriarchy, Either way you look at it the theory asserts that *men are the oppressors of women* as a result from benefiting from the patriarchy. On this site alone I'm sure you'll be able to find some people that disagree with you.\n2) Even given with assumption of validity of patriarchy theory, the way that feminists are going about 'dismantling the patriarchy' is just horrible. Even outside of advocating for eugenics (radical feminism) among other things, their advocacy efforts have resulted in *extreme* inequities between the sexes that feminism counts as 'victories'. Do you not have an issue with that?",

As a woman, there's a tendency for you to see the challenges facing women more clearly than those facing men.  This is true for everyone: we each see our own problems as bigger than anyone else's, and we don't even really understand other people's experiences.\n\nOne problem with feminism is that it's largely been developed by women.  After 50 years of second wave feminism led by women, we've ended up with exactly what you'd expect: a theory centred around women's experiences and which relegates to the periphery the issues men have to deal with.\n\nWhen people here talk against feminism, they're saying precisely this.  They feel marginalised by feminism, and justifiably so because their views haven't been fully heard within mainstream feminism.\n\n> It feels crappy when you talk against my rights.\n\nNo one here is talking against your rights.

Remember that most groups of any kind will claim they benefit society in some capacity, but we can almost certainly show that atleast some of these groups harm rather than help. \n\nAs long as feminists paint things like domestic violence and rape as gendered issues, they will be the enemy.

When you correct for the kinds of work being done the gap vanishes.  SIMPLE TRUTH:\n\nWOMEN CHOOSE TO WORK FEWER HOURS, CHOOSE TO STUDY CAREERS THAT ARE NOT AS HIGHLY DEMANDED OR COMPETITIVE, AND WHEN THEY HAVE CHILDREN THEY OFTEN CHANGE CAREERS TO HAVE MORE FREE TIME.\n\nAll of these things impact women's earnings relative to men and NONE OF THEM are men's fault, and none of them men can do anything about.  When you zoom out way far, like feminists have done, YES, absolutely, women are going to make less than men because they make work-life decisions that tend to result in lower lifetime earnings.  But if you zoom in on the jobs being done, the hours worked, the education achieved, the gap vanishes.\n\nAnd when was the last time you were harassed in the street?",

Because under Affirmative Action the qualifications, skills, and achievements of *every woman* are cast into doubt. Women get the thumb on the scale, so people can't trust the stated weight of any woman's worth. It *takes away* respect for women \u2014 for all women, even the ones who could previously justifiably point to an untampered scale to prove their worth.\n\nUnder equality of opportunity with no Affirmative Action, the rise in the number of women will be smaller and slower, but those women will genuinely be respected and admired when they achieve something. Conversely, under Affirmative Action, how can even other women respect someone and see them as a role model if they don't know if they genuinely deserve to be there or are just a token making up the numbers?\n\nAffirmative Action creates division, suspicion, and resentment on both sides. \n\n>...many female individuals rejected for certain positions were as qualified and even more qualified than men applying for the job.\n\nEven if this were true, it is not an argument for Affirmative Action \u2014 it is an argument for truly choosing a candidate based on merit.\n\n>Also because of us copying what we're seeing, women are more likely to apply to those positions if they've seen women in them.\n\nI really think women are being done a disservice by this sort of approach \u2014 with the idea that the environment should be made familiar, comfortable, and welcoming before women should even consider entering into it.\n\nInstead, girls should be taught that real personal empowerment is in learning that you can choose to go where you want to go and do what you want to do while refusing to let obstacles and discomfort stand in your way; that to succeed in your life, to follow your passion, you need to develop this mindset \u2014 which includes having thick skin and grit. \n\nThis idea that all of the hurdles should be cleared off the course or women won't even start running works as a tactic in group politics (claim victimhood, demand something and be handed it), but if individual women actually take this mindset to heart they are disempowering themselves in their own minds. You can't get someone to hand you a successful life of genuine achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Meanwhile, women dominate every other area of education and feminists don't do anything to help men in these areas.  They literally advocate to have women on top in everything.",

There are a lot of troll posts here trying to quotemine a MRA to pull an out-of-context quote for circlejerking purposes on the more\u2026vicious online feminist sites.\n\nYou also will find some hostility from the fact that you seem to be posting with ignorance. It's not that you're asking questions, it's that you are asking questions in a manner many\nwould find insulting. Let me explain: \n\n> I am a feminist and I want to understand your point of view. \n\nThis is good! And *exceedingly* rare. Feminists generally relegate the male perspective to a footnote\u2014if they're generous. It will temporarily raise the DEFCON level for troll, which I believe is cooling off now as you have made efforts towards discourse.\n\n> To me, feminism is about all gender issues. \n\nAnd that's what many ex-feminists here used to think. But that's not the academic definition. And feminists have commonly avoided embracing any kind of general definition so they can employ **NAFALT**.\n\n> A problem such as my brother being discriminated against in his status as a single father is to me an issue that feminism fights against.\n\nThis will strike a nerve for some. Feminisms often do not give a shit about men's issues until it affects someone they love. And then they are faced with three choices: abandon the one they love to preserve their feminist credentials, go down one hell of a rabbit hole as they are forced to awake themselves from indoctrination, or the easiest option: applied cognitive dissonance.\n\n> It seems to me that in fighting feminism, your whole movement is just fighting itself. \n\nTo be clear, I believe most MRAs issues with feminism is that it directly and actively prevents gender equality. Maybe one day, when feminism does not work to impede the progress of men's rights, we can cast off the name MRA and drop the M in MHRM. I hope that day comes in my lifetime.\n\n> Do you not see that statements implying lots of women lie about being raped stem from the same place as statements saying all men accused of rape are guilty?\n\nI assume you are talking about harmful gender roles? I won't even touch rape, it's too long a post. I believe that most sane MRAs do not believe most women lie about rape\u2014but a few bad apples spoil the bunch. When the Lady Justice is no longer blind due to institutional discrimination, when even a mere accusation is enough to destroy a man's life (often literally), and when is a result of primarily feminist groups such as NOW promoting a rape narrative (which are quick to state false accusations don't occur in any statistical significance), then it's not the same. Feminism made this mess, not \"rape culture\".\n\n> It also seems to me the main point in a lot of the arguments here is that men are also subject to dehumanisation, and that therefore patriarchy and misogyny is bullshit. That's just plain illogical!\n\nIt is true: that would make a shitty argument. Much for the same reason that women facing oppression is proof of the existence of patriarchy. It's not actual proof, it's just the idea that if men as a class are oppressing women as a class for class benefit, they are really, really incompetent at oppression. (Seriously, I've been waiting on my Patriarchy Pass for years.)\n\nAlso, I don't think anyone here claims misogyny is bullshit without getting buried in downvotes. The MHRM is not about invalidating women's struggles.\n\n> All genders are subject to dehumanisation and the fact that men are, too, does not make it less true that women are. This is a fight we must fight together. Feminists are not your enemy. \n\nWere I wish that were true, this movement would be a *cakewalk*. But feminism today is directly opposed to gender equality. Many here were once feminists who tried to pursue gender equality in the manner you have stated. For their efforts, the were branded misogynists and outcasts.\n\nFeminism claims to help men, while also telling them to sit down and shut up\u2014the women are talking. Their basic premise, patriarchy theory, is misandric by nature\u2014it's in the very name! They co-opt social movements and attempt to pervert them to their own causes: viewing everything through the eyes of the oppressor. Examples include gay rights, atheism/skepticism, and even Occupy Wall Street. They then redefine oppressed as themselves and demand penance. It's basically how a virus works. Harsh critique\u2026but true.\n\n> It's a shame to see thinking people fall prey to such logical fallacies. Just imagine the things we could do together.\n\nBecome marginalized by feminism and it's institutional power again? \"Fool me once, shame on you\u2026\" You can't even call yourself a gender egalitarian (it's already earned the puerile insult \"eagle-tarian\", since obviously it means I'm a rednecked secret-misogynist American) or humanist without being scorned by feminists, since they believe they hold the monopoly on victimization and injustice.\n\n> We are fighting for the same cause, men's rights activists who hate feminists and feminists who hate men's rights activists just need to see it!\n\nThe MHRM was the feminism we were promised but was never delivered.\n\nWelcome to /r/MensRights and enjoy your stay. So long as you act in good faith others will be respectful of you; you won't be censored or banned for holding a differing viewpoint than the majority. I can't say the same with certain other subreddits that disagree with the goals of the MHRM.",

I believe I think you would come to a similar conclusion as I have given the facts.\n\n### My view (I recommend you make your own first, though!)\n\nI think that it was once a valid argument when pointing out flaws in feminism\u2014one self-proclaimed feminist advocating genocide of all men certainly is not a valid criticism of feminism. In that case, feminists would proclaim that Not All Feminists Are Like That. We shouldn't call all Muslims terrorists because a tiny few conspired to create the events of 9/11. And it is a logical fallacy: No True Scotsman.\n\nExcept when the Scotsman are more like that criticism than not. NAFALT has been used by feminists to defend feminism to such a degree it would actually be farcical if feminism did not hold strong institutional power. It has been used so much that it is now been twisted to be used as an argument against feminism. Because if NAFALT when some feminist says something horribly misandric, transphobic, etc.: show me the ones who are not like that. Show me the feminists condemning such actions! \n\nBecause the concept of the sisterhood is quite strong, and many a female ex-feminist was astounded by how fast her brethren turned on her the moment she broke from the idealogical tenets of feminism. Feminism is stagnant, homogenous, and so we often ask: if not all feminists are like that, show me them. Show me the ones that will decry misandry and support equality for all. Because they shalln't stay a feminist for long\u2014and it won't be the MRAs doing.\n\nIf you would like me to support my assertions and blah blah, or just want to share your favorite coffee (or tea!), just orangered me!",

But there are substantial divisions, and, as the article makes clear, areas of overlap with feminism.\n\nPersonally, I'm in the MRA (Equalist) camp.  I believe that men and women should be treated equally.  This applies in areas where men have traditionally been treated better, but just as much in areas where women have been traditionally treated better.\n\nYou probably won't agree with the \"analysis of feminism\" in the article, but most manosphere types agree with it.  From the manosphere perspective, feminism seeks to improve the lot of women.  There are some areas where women are traditionally disadvantaged (eg. striving to become a CEO).  So feminists will attempt to make it easier for women to be CEOs.  Then there are areas where women are traditionally treated better (eg. women get shorter prison sentences for the same crime as men).  As far as I can tell, feminists are either silent on this issue, or occasionally feminists have called for an even greater disparity (eg. abolishing women's prisons or asking judges to show leniency to mothers for the sake of the kids).\n\nThe net effect of combining these two types of responses means that feminism is looking to constantly increase the power and well-being of women.

And ultimately that movement, could be more successful than either feminism or MRM.\n\nI would sign up for it if there were feminist partners that seemed to understand the MRM point of view.  But, in general, most feminists that have wanted to partner with the MRM have a lot of ideological convictions that are anathema to the MRM.\n\nBased on your note, these are my opinions on your statements:\n\n1) Yes, I agree that all gender prejudice should be fought.  Women and men both have problems, and the problems of both sexes should be combatted.\n\n2) The movement isn't fighting 2nd wave feminism, it's fighting 3rd wave stuff.  In some cases, it's because modern feminism seems to be fighting against gender equality.  (eg. the peer-reviewed Archer 2000 meta-analysis  shows that men and women commit DV in equal proportion, yet most feminists will not acknowledge that, and in fact work to promote the idea that only men are abusers.)\n\nhttp://www.menwebjournal.com/ArcherSexDifferencesMeta-AnalyticReviewf2000.pdf\n\nIn other cases, there is a sense of unfairness.  For example, feminists seem to trumpet programs to get more women into STEM.  But women make up 60% of the university campus, and there doesn't seem to be the same push to get men into, say, psychology.  I'd be fully on board with pro-women to STEM programs if they were matched with pro-men to psychology, accountancy, pediatrician, teaching, nursing, etc.  Without that reciprocity, my support for women to STEM programs is lukewarm.\n\nMy metaphor is two kids that are given different desserts.  For some reason, there is a tradition in a family that boys get chocolate cake and girls get apple pie.  Both good options, but it makes no sense that the kids get no choice.  Maybe at one point all the girls in the house truly preferred apple pie and the boys preferred chocolate cake.  But now, the kids have no choice because of house rules and social pressure to meet gender roles.  The way I see feminists approaching the issue is insisting that the boys give up half their cake, while the girls get to keep their pie, because cake is *obviously* better than pie.  My preferred solution, is that both the boys and girls get a choice in dessert, or possibly give everyone half a slice of each dessert.  If presented with only the feminist solution, I'd prefer the traditional status quo.\n\n3) I think most people recognize that men and women both have issues.  Just because men have issues doesn't mean that women don't also have them.  I think that's more a misconception of outsiders to think that just because the MRM believes that men suffer from sexism doesn't mean that women don't also suffer from sexism.\n\n4) I have a problem with the word patriarchy.  I believe there is a system of societally enforced gender roles and expectations that constrain both men and women, though in different ways.  I believe that men are advantaged in some ways and women are advantaged in other ways.  Both men and women have societal power and both men and women reinforce these gender roles.  Patriarchy seems to go beyond that and say that these gender roles are mostly imposed by men and for the benefit of men.  If you could agree to dump that last part, I'd be on board.  Ideally patriarchy would be renamed something like Gender Role Enforcement.\n\nWhat do you think?  Are we potential allies, or doomed to be enemies?",

While it is good to see some self-identified feminists coming forward and expressing empathy for men's issues, the fact of the matter is that feminism as an institution has, in many instances, actively pushed for laws which fail to acknowledge male victims and has worked to deliberately obfuscate the facts of male suffering. And it's not just feminism's actions which are wrong, but the very theory to which they adhere, that of pervading patriarchy being the cause of suffering for both men and women. Until feminism can reject that notion outright and acknowledge female agency, acknowledge that our society is shaped not just by men but by the independent choices, beliefs, and actions of women as well, it will not have a reality-based theoretical foundation with which to truly help anybody, men or women. Gender roles are not solely formed by the expectations men place upon women and other men, but also by the expectations women place upon men and other women. Failure to acknowledge the latter is failure to acknowledge half of reality, and it just becomes a ridiculous, unfounded, unending game of \"but he started it!\"\n\nI am all for discussion, and there are plenty of places where both men and women continue to be subjected to unfair gender-based discrimination in society. We can and should work together to figure out a better way forward. But where feminists are concerned and coming forward, the discussion has to start with their broken theory.",

Now, I should state that I I avoided gender subjects in the attainment of my sociology degree which is just as well because I don't think I would've fared well in a subject that uses polar opposite terms to create 2 gender specific interpretations of the exact same phenomenon (privilege and benevolent sexism). The only thing that makes a compelling case for is the assertion that any theory where such a blatantly duplicitous interpretation is accepted is being designed (poorly I might add) to fit a predetermined conclusion which is, I shouldn't have to say this but, exactly how not to conduct objective and honest research.  Any objective social researcher with integrity should reject any such theory for, if nothing else, a fundamentally flawed methodology. \n\nPatriarchy is an unhelpful theory for the fact that it can and does lead black and white thinkers to hold men who don't benefit from the elite's \"patriarchal\" power accountable  while simultaneously ignoring women who do benefit from this. \n\nPower is both overt and covert and behind every powerful man, is the woman that influences and benefits from his actions e.g when a CEO implements a policy that widens inequality, his wife benefits as he does and more than likely could influence his behaviour but chooses not to due to his actions being beneficial to her. \n\nWe see that this concept is not new and is best illustrated in Shakespeare's MacBeth in which we see Lady MacBeth exert covert power on her husband in order to help him realise his ambition of obtaining greater overt power. At one point MacBeth loses his nerve and Lady MacBeth spurs him on to ensure he sees his plan through. \n\nPatriarchy theory asserts that men benefit at the expense of women which is a profoundly simplistic analysis that either overlooks or simply disregards too many factors to be deemed a viable theory. It is at best inadequately reasoned, at worst gravely disingenuous. \n\nWhat country are you from anyway?",

              "body": "Here's the real problem. There are some very influential organizations that many would maintain represent mainstream feminism (NOW, AAUW are prime examples) who use their influence in part to actively create some of the issues that the MRM fights. Many good people considering themselves feminist are unaware of this, and continue to support them financially, politically, and morally. They are extremely resistant to hearing the good name of these organizations sullied. Because of the power of the feminist brand. This is why some of the MRM are egalitarian, sympathetic to women's issues, non-traditionalists, and still call themselves anti-feminist. Because we think that the term feminism has become enshrined in an aura of moral authority that allows real harm to be done and go unchecked in its' name.\n\nSome Examples by issue:\n\n**Male Educational Attainment** :\n\nthe AAUW has exerted considerable influence on the Department of Education to focus on girl students at the expense of boy students.  This is not legislation, but it is discriminatory, and has occurred while our programs to evaluate performance of public education told [this story](http://www.avoiceformalestudents.com/know-the-issues/issues/educational-attainment-and-well-being-of-men-and-boys/)).  I do not blame the AAUW's initial actions- they were responding to a series of articles written by Carol Gilligan that portrayed girls in crisis- however, we see the same pattern that I described above.  Midway into their program, the AAUW began to receive information that contradicted their initial assumptions.  Rather than respond to this information, they ignored it.  This all came to a head around the year 2000, when Christina Hoff Sommers wrote her book \"The War on Boys\", and documented a lot of AAUW's willful ignorance.  The response of the AAUW was to [double down](http://www.aauw.org/2008/05/16/refuting-the-boys-crisis-myth/) on their attempts to minimize the impact of public education's failure with boys, and continue to try to focus on girls who are demonstrably already being better served.\n\nAlso, I can't prove that [the dear colleague letter](http://thefire.org/article/13509.html) that is [causing some considerable dismay](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324600704578405280211043510) was the direct result of lobbying, but I'll confess that I think it likely, and I haven't managed to find any feminist organizations even speaking out about the abridgement of due process.  Actually I have: Camille Paglia denounced it, but her status as a feminist seems to be constantly debated.\n\n**Domestic Violence:**\n[Primary Aggressor Policies](http://onemv.tumblr.com/post/54091808330), and the National Organization of Women [worked tirelessly](http://ncfm.org/2012/06/news/domestic-abuse-violence/the-national-coalition-for-women-blasts-efforts-to-include-sensible-and-gender-inclusive-provisions-in-legislation-to-reauthorize-the-violence-against-women-act/) to prevent the inclusion of gender inclusive provisions into VAWA.  Incidentally, just google \"male domestic violence victims\" to see how many feminist websites you see trying to bury the issue.  I don't know if you've seen 'shame' yet, but here's a [good teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-kEC13qk_g)\n\n**Access to children**\nI'll just provide this [link](http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/enews/cv/enews-20120614.html).  NOW again. \n\n**Disparate Sentencing**\n[here's somethign I wrote when frustrated trying to find a good organization working on that problem](http://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1fhd4m/leaders_from_various_womens_groups_and_brooklyn/caaa0br)\n\n**Sexual Abuse**\n[Mary Koss's efforts to prevent sexual abuse of men from being properly categorized](http://www.genderratic.com/p/2551/male-privilege-defining-male-victims-out-of-existence/).  [More of a breakdown here](http://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1ocyi6/when_a_man_did_report_explicitly_that_a_woman/).\n\n------\nIf to you, feminism is:\n\n> To me, feminism is about all gender issues. A problem such as my brother being discriminated against in his status as a single father is to me an issue that feminism fights against.\n\nThen let me ask you this: given that there are organizations using that brand as cover to take actions contrary to what you think feminism is- will you continue to use that label?  Will you try to organize other people like you to challenge NOW's claims to represent feminists?  Or will you just tolerate those acts for the \"greater good\"?",

In fact, we could have 100% female representation at the top of the class structure and it could still be attributed to patriarchy theory.  It makes no predictions and there is nothing testable to verify that it does not exist (ie, when we have legal and societal equality).  \n\nPersonally, I have issues with very few people who call themselves feminists.  However, I have issues with every feminist group and organization, particularly the absurdly well funded lobbying groups.  IF the patriarchy is the cause of all inequality and IF the actions of these groups will remove it, eventually all the inequalities will be removed.  The problem is we want legal inequalities addressed, but to tear down the patriarchy, we need to get more women in awesome jobs, not change laws by definition only women can be raped.\n\nYou came in here saying \"you're wrong\" and then back up your statements with nothing, assuming we are all uneducated and just don't understand feminism.  This happens regularly in this sub and it's always obvious that the individual never made an attempt to even understand.  I always find it comedic because they fall into the same assumption we are accused of \n\n",

Let me know what she thinks patriarchy is. It is not merely the 'habit of putting men in power', it's the thought that all women are denied it through overt and subtle discrimination, a thought that is continually refuted. That we humans merely just 'copy what we see' is banal and sophomoric, to say the least. Patriarchy theory is the belief that our society is setup to deny women power and agency, and give men ill-gotten power and agency at the expense of these women.\n",

I believe there is a system of societally enforced gender roles and expectations that constrain both men and women, though in different ways. I believe that men are advantaged in some ways and women are advantaged in other ways. Both men and women have societal power and both men and women reinforce these gender roles. Patriarchy seems to go beyond that and say that these gender roles are mostly imposed by men and for the benefit of men. If you could agree to dump that last part, I'd be on board. Ideally patriarchy would be renamed something like Gender Role Enforcement.\"\n\nSo for example, people perceive men as being agentic.  This makes them seem to be good business and political leaders.  *But* being perceived as non-agentic can benefit women.  Women get lesser criminal sentences for the same crimes.  We rush to help women, but not men, when people are victims of violence.  Most of the homeless are men.  A homeless woman elicits more sympathy.  If you are willing to acknowledge that women gain from \"patriarchy\" about as much as they lose, then we can talk.",

Because feminists believe all men should be assumed guilty.  \n \nThe true amount of false rape reports is largely unknown since there hasnt been a real effort to make a really detailed society wide study on it. What we do know is the claims feminists make on the prevalence of false rape claims is at best ignorant of what they are using as evidence, or they are lying, because we know the true number is much greater than they say it is. Even today we have mainstream feminists and organisations claiming its not just only a couple of percent, but that false rape claims are a \"myth\" and that it \"just doesnt happen\" at all! \n\n \n \n\n >It also seems to me the main point in a lot of the arguments here is that men are also subject to dehumanisation, and that therefore patriarchy and misogyny is bullshit.\n\nYes, that would not be a logical argument. In a nutshell, the reason Patriarchy theory is considered bullshit is because it does not stand up to logical or historical scrutiny. It is many factors, not just one.\n\n Also, no one denies that misogyny exists. Feminists however by a vast margin deny misandry exists, or that it is even possible.\n \n>Feminists are not your enemy. It's a shame to see thinking people fall prey to such logical fallacies. Just imagine the things we could do together.\n\nIf you dont know why the MRM are so anti-feminist maybe you should try to spend more time listening. There is a very good reason why feminism is so heavily criticised. The Christina Hoff Sommers view of feminism while accepting of men and boys issues, may still be based on a flawed theory and position, but at least its not \"our enemy\". The mainstream view of feminism however, is. They are the ones coming out with these anti-rape campaigns, funding dishonest studies, creating legislation. etc.\n\n \n  \n\n\n",

My impressions:\n\n* fantastic sets and cinematography\n* amazing stunt men\n* piss poor plot\n* this was **not** a Mad Max movie - it was a Charlize Theron movie - Max was barely in it.\n* it was a clear 'lets make a strong female hero' story, and like Thor before her is simply using the male title as a vehicle.\n* while there were black, white and asian women, there were only evil white men.\n* the only people who's lives mattered were the semi-educated young women.\n* the screen was awash with semi-naked disposable men\n* the breeders were as self-centered and irrational as any feminist I've ever met\n* people who know that water and petrol is scarce don't seem to treat it with any respect or value\n* women think it's fine for a man to be owned and used but not young semi-educated women.  \"You can't own people\" - apparently men aren't people.\n\nI've lived in a third world country and if the breeders were able to live in complete safety with unlimited resources in the care of the 'sultan' they would **NEVER EVER** try to leave.  That part (ie. the plot) was the stupidest thing about the movie.\n\n** SPOILER **\n\nThe thing I hated the most was the oh-so-easily foreseen message that the only way for an evil white man to get into heaven is to sacrifice his life for young semi-educated white women.  That was a little ham-fisted.\n\nFor people not into car chase movies - I'd give it a miss.",

If I could have felt their suffering more tangibly, or if their value had been played up as being rare non-mutant women of child-bearing age who will repopulate the world, I could better rationalize the pedestal that Miller placed them on. As it was (upon first viewing) they were on that pedestal because they suffered *differently* (not worse) than everyone else, and that they were supermodel-beautiful. And clean. And that didn't sit right with me.\n\nI look forward to stepping back, blurring my eyes a bit, and watching it again.",

              "body": "Hollywood being Hollywood: The Sequel to Continue All Sequels\n\n**tl;dr - It's just a movie, but then again, it is a Hollywood movie.**\n\nI have not yet had the opportunity to see Mad Max: Fury Road, so I cannot comment on anything in the film beyond that I have seen in the trailers and what has been described to me. However, I can generally comment on how the major motion picture industry operates.\n\nWhether or not the themes are intentional, the vocabulary of Hollywood is determined by the people who provide the financial backing to the films. Just as there has been controversy about the influence of China over Hollywood productions in how China is portrayed, there has been controversy over the content of films as they reflect on gender, ethnicity, social status, et cetera.\n\nWriters can write a screenplay, perhaps without any sort of ulterior motives other than to tell the story in their heads, but if their motives have been warped by a society that favors one group or ideology over another (like whites over blacks, or feminism vs. what feminists decide is misogyny), then it is simply garbage in, garbage out.\n\nOn the other hand, a writer can writes something that is devoid of motive and then the studio or producers can tell the writer needs to be changed. If the writer doesn't want to change the script, the studio can buy the script and then hire another writer for a rewrite.\n\nIn this case, George Miller, the writer himself, chose to involve a feminist in the creation. That's fine - that's his choice; it is his world. It'd be like Tolkien consulting with a Druid on the nature of Ents. However, I'd like to look at this from another angle. This film series takes place in a ruined future. Broad themes are boiled down to archetypal figureheads and anthropomorphized quintessences.\n\nAs an action thriller series, Mad Max has seen the character Max go from a police officer with a family to a hardened Road Warrior, adapting to and surviving, if not overcoming both his world (as it devolves around him) and the villains that emerge to threaten him and those for whom he chooses to fight. Apparently, he goes from being a prisoner trying to escape, to escaped prisoner simply trying to remain free and to survive, to choosing to acknowledge someone else's plight, and to fight for them.\n\nIf you are Max, having survived so much and having loved and lost so much, why would you bother trying to save anyone else but yourself? Why would you dignify anyone with any communication other than grunts, if you fully expect them to die in the wasteland that is the world? Perhaps his choice to join Furiosa is a choice made out of hope - that there are other people with the same grit and determination to survive as him.\n\nMaybe it isn't about simply having the same physical ability, but the mental ability. I am pretty sure the bulk of the consultation with Eve Ensler was about the liberated women. I've heard about how people will put themselves in a place mentally to get them through situations of rape and torture - it helps them survive, to be able to get them through to when they might be freed. They are not 100% coming out the other side of that abuse. This is why we have therapists and counselors - we comfort and aid those who have suffered.\n\nGiven her experiences with women in real-life circumstances of enslavement, rape, and abuse which may or may not be totally reflected in this film, I think the idea is that the suffering that the women have experienced merits their liberation and protection. Perhaps the suggestion is that prolonged suffering at the hands of a psychopath is worse than a quick, albeit violent, death. This is why some people in captivity choose to take their own lives - to retain a modicum of dignity. However, I think people are more likely to try to survive.\n\nIn Furiosa, perhaps he has found someone who is his counterpart. I've heard Furiosa described as being able to hold her own in a fight. I'm pretty sure having a metal fist would give a little advantage in a fistfight. Having a strong female character is not new. Sigourney Weaver as Ripley in the Alien series is from over 30 years ago.\n\nI think Max sees the same physical and emotional strength he knows he possesses in other people: Furiosa's physical and emotional strength and the people she is leading, and deems them worthy of his assistance, or because the are or have been victims of violence or perceived injustice. This is another common theme in both movies and television. For whatever reason, the first such exaple that came to mind covers both media: [Zatoichi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zatoichi). Perhaps the film [Blind Fury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Fury) starring Rutger Hauer, is more recognizable, but it was inspired by Zatoichi and employs this theme of someone who has suffered, survived, and helps others overcome.\n\nAs far as any controversy surrounding the film's messages, I prefer to err on the side of tropes and archetypes. However incorrect they may be, they are what people are familiar with, and familiarity is profitable. Familiarity, however, does breed contempt, and I think it is the folks who have locked onto the familiar tropes and archetypes (which are in fact propagandist or generally biased in nature) who are finding faults with Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nI'll reserve a full judgement until I see the film for myself, but I have a strong suspicion that my prejudication may be correct.\n\n*edits early on for incomplete thoughts and formatting",

        "body": "I finally watched Mad Max: Fury Road, and despite my deep desire not to notice any 'Feminist' sympathies and to just enjoy the goddamned movie, I simply could not overlook a strongly feminist narrative. This certainly might suggest I need to polish my mental lens that's warped too far to bring examples of Feminism in culture into focus; Indeed, it seems that I'm in the minority here who have this opinion of the movie. The feminist mythology at play tonight, however, seemed obvious to me, and I'm astonished that more people don't see it:\n\nThere was not a single female villain in the movie, despite the society being diverse and meritocratic enough to allow a resourceful woman to become a hero like Furiosa. There should be strong women peppering their ranks, including the soldiers. The villains were exclusively male, represented by disfigured, middle-aged stand-ins for business (the guy wearing the suit and pants who ran the refinery) and the military-industrial complex (the old guy in the tank.)- two classic punching bags representing 'Patriarchy.'\n\n\nThe escaped women are the most treasured, and the most important, figures in the film. All other heroes risk their lives to protect these women, despite these women having done nothing to earn that loyalty. (Indeed, all they've done is to turn their back on what, to most people, would seem like a pretty charmed life- Food, shelter, water, hygiene. No, obviously not an ideal situation, but humanity's against the ropes, and their quality of life was simply unimaginable to most of the humans in the film. They were princesses fleeing what was certainly a dehumanizing situation, still one that many/most would have traded their own for in a heartbeat in this apocalyptic world.) They were worth dying for because they were women; meanwhile, men die by the dozens around them.\n\nYou might suggest that there were strong, sympathetic males in the movie in the form of Max and the War Boy- Those characters began as animals. Max, understandably mentally twisted into a survival machine, communicated in grunts until his sympathy for Furiosa 'civilized' him and he finally earned the removal of his symbolic muzzle. The sympathetic War Boy was the hand of the enemy, and out for his own glorious, murderous death, until the values of the (religious) Patriarchal society failed him and he was able to console to one of the escaped women.\n\nI know, this is sounding pretty extreme and off-the-hook. The basic pieces of the Feminist narrative are all in place, though- White men in control of society (usually *literally* white.) Women on the run from power-mad males seeking to control their sexuality; Good male allies available, but only after being 'tamed' to serve them; Femininity/ism as the obvious solution to the problems of a world ruined by men.\n\nI understand that consultant to the film Eve Ensler has seen parts of the world, and the humanitarian horrors therein, that I can only imagine.  I don't doubt that the society in the MM:FR could (quite) loosely mirror the social structures of warlord-controlled populations in third world countries. Those situations, yes, are effectively illuminated by the spotlight that the feminist narrative can provide. The fact that the society of MM:FR may to some degree resemble real societies (\"societies\",) doesn't change the fact that those horror stories from the other side of the world *are* described by the Feminist mythology, just as MM:FR does.\n\nPerhaps that's my avenue for enjoying this film- To see it not as the preaching of 3rd Wave Feminism, but as an allegory to the terrible circumstances of millions of women in the worst parts of the world, and a very possible, very terrible future for all of us.\n\nNevertheless, I felt the finger pointing right at me.\n\nThanks for reading.",

              "body": "So here's the thing: This issue comes up on this forum quite often.\n\nTL;DR people who proclaim that they are feminists or that feminism is only about equality are \"useful idiots\" for the radicals who push for female superiority under the guise of an otherwise seemingly harmless, if not universally beneficial agenda of \"equality\". Their agenda is NOT equality, and yet they too, call themselves feminists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople who think they are in favor of equality think they are feminists. Maybe feminists once were for equality, maybe they weren't. You can get into a long historical debate on that if you want, going back to 1848 at Seneca Falls. All I really care to discuss about that with you is that if you research this topic honestly and diligently, you will see that many of the things you think you know about the so-called \"feminist\" movement, and indeed many of the things that continue to be said and taught about it, are not actually accurate.\n\nSetting that aside, there remains a problem with the CURRENT use of the term \"feminism\". All of the things you say make you angry in your opening post are the result of \"feminism\". Do those things look like \"equality\" to you? You said they make you angry, so I must assume that they do not look like equality to you. They are STILL the result of feminism.\n\nAt some point, bring those things up to feminists, see what their response to you is. You will see that reactions will vary. Let's put aside that the majority of \"feminists\" will simply dismiss you on the grounds that they believe your claims are untrue, however, from the remaining minority, you will find a WIDE range of reactions.\n\nOn one end of the spectrum, there will be some people who, like you, are incensed about them. These folks will insist that these things aren't REALLY due to feminism. In the middle will be the people who acknowledge that these things aren't fair, but that they aren't too fussed over them because of the other grievances feminism tells them that they have, and finally, on the radical end are the ones who acknowledge the inequality of these issues, and who are happy for them as these people are actually happy with feminine superiority; something far from equality, yes?\n\nThe thing is that thes radicals are the ones pushing the agendas which propagate these inequities and push for feminine superiority. They believe that females are superior to men and that it is the natural order of things for females to actually be \"in power\" in every way, legally, socially, economically, over men. If these \"feminists\" were advocating for such things on the basis of race, what would we call them?\n\nNow we have the problem: YOU u/Zeam_Beam call yourself a feminist because you believe feminism is about equality. I tagged your handle here because I want you to read this and think about it. People like you - well meaning and likely good hearted, continuing to assert that your status as a \"feminist\" is because of your belief in equality, provides \"cover\" for the radicals who would see their agenda taken to the extreme. In the subterfuge/political/espionage world there is a term for you, and all the others who think and proclaim (the louder the better) that feminism is about equality; and who can find fault with that, right? That term is \"useful idiot\".\n\nAsk those feminists if they think the things you said make you angry should be corrected, and they will likely hit you with rape statistics and how rape affects women in the vast majority (while omitting the fact that almost every government and law enforcement agency on the planet with a legal definition of rape defines it as someting that requires the perpetrator to penetrate the victim, which makes the act of non-consensual PIV sex committed by a woman on a male, not, by legal definition, rape.)\n\nThey will cite domestic violence statistics but will ignore the fact that women commit domestic violence with a greater frequency than men do. While yes it is true that men tend to do more damage when they commit domestic violence than women do, the fact remains that women perpetrate acts of domestic violence more frequently.\n\nThey will cite the wage gap, which has been debunked more thoroughly and convincingly and more widely than flat earth theory.\n\nThey will cite statistics on underrepresentation of women in the highest paid and most powerful positions, while ignoring the OVERrepresentation of men in the lowest paid and most dangerous professions.\n\nSo... it's time we really stopped tolerating statements like \"there are many definitions of feminism\". While this is objectively true, that statement and the application of it does nothing more than provide more cover for the ugliness of the very sexist female superiority agenda.\n\nI will offer you a metaphor: The Confederate Flag of the United States is a symbol of many things. One of the things it is a symbol of is the concept of States' rights, which is a fundamental principle of the US Constitution. However, it has ALSO been preempted as a symbol of white supremacy and racism. Now, if I, a STRONG believer in States' rights and our Constitution, want to fly a Confederate Flag, there will be no questions asked about why I am flying it. Nobody will say \"Well, there is a person who believes very strongly in the Constitution and States' rights.\"\n\nThey will conclude instantly and without reservation (and to the agreement of virtually any other American around them): \"There is a racist!\"\n\nSo... while feminism may have several definitions, like the Confederate flag with its varied definitions, only one of those definitions matters anymore and it's time we start acknowledging that and responding accordingly.\n\nI submit to you that YOU are NOT actually a feminist if your original post is true. You have, unfortunately been duped to believe that what you stand for is what feminism is. Unfortunately, that is not what feminism is. What you stand for is as foreign to the ACTUAL feminist agenda as bicycles are to fish.",

Example: insistence that more women CEOs are needed while not insisting that more women bricklayers are needed.

You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: \"Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,\" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, \"we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.\"\r  \n\r  \nYou're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.\r  \n\r  \nYou're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were \"ambivalent about their sexual desires\" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.\r  \n\r  \nYou're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.\r  \n\r  \nYou're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.\r  \n\r  \nYou're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.\r  \n\r  \nYou're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.\r  \n\r  \nYou're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.\r  \n\r  \nYou're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's \"part of her sexual history.\"\r  \n\r  \nYou're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is \"not a crime\" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a \"legal\" way to rape them.\r  \n\r  \nAnd you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.\r  \n\r  \nYou're the true feminist.

We could argue that the patriarchal structure we've already discussed helped to *enforce* gender roles and expectations on men and women. But it's not originally responsible for them, nor solely responsible for their perpetuation.\n\nWhen it comes to men's issues, I think \"patriarchy\" is a particularly unhelpful concept because it is concerned with who does or does not occupy positions of power and self-determination. Most men's issues are not about lack of access to power and self-determination, but about lack of access to wellbeing and value.",

Some think the feminist movement just needed an enemy to oppose.  Some think women take their tendency to fit in with other women and look out for each other and project that on to men, thinking they have something similar, a \"patriarchy\".  It just isn't the case.  Men throw men under the bus more readily than women.  Men don't get treated better by other men just for being a man.

That's because the women's movement was associated with the temperance movement so the only opposition came from the alcohol industry.  That's one reason why the 19th amendment passed as soon as the 18th did.  The other reason being that until the early 20th century most women were opposed to women being able to vote.  And I don't mean they personally didn't want to vote.  I mean they didn't want ANY women to vote.  The men were fine with women voting.  Even feminists (of the day - history since re-written of course) acknowledged men supported female vote more than women did.\n\nAs for the working thing women could do that anyway, but most who weren't working class didn't have to.  They do now because once a lot of women entered the work force wages crashed so that now both husband and wife must work to cover costs.  So feminism actually made women's lives a lot worse by forcing them to work in many cases.  If you mean the equal pay thing women opposed equal pay for women too.  The reason being that at that time most women's income was their husbands wages.  Paying women the same (ie letting them compete) was known to lower wages for men and thus financially ruin most women.  Which then happened.\n\nWomen went from many of them not having to work back to them having to work.  Most women in the early 20th century did not see that as a positive.",

But it doesn't happen.\n\n> women's worth being based off of men they have dated/are dating\n\nI have no idea what that means.  Men for example have literally been fined money as a legal tax if they don't have a gf or a wife (\"Batchelor tax\") in various countries at various times.  What you're talking about I have no idea.\n\nAre these women's biggest \"issues\" according to you?  That's pathetic.

And they also judge other women by the status of a woman's boyfriend/husband.  It's not men doing it.  If anything, it's a negative if we think your previous boyfriend/husband raised your expectations higher than the status we can provide.   \n\n> the whole sleeping around\n\nThis one is tricky since it on the surface it does seem like there should be an equivalence there.   I've wondered about this too and I've heard different explanations on it.  One of them that I found interesting was an article on woman in hookup culture and it was very apparent that they somehow thought the experience of the average guy was similar to theirs - that it was pretty easy.  They didn't realize that something like 80% of the women on hookup apps are all hooking up with the same 5% of guys on there.  For the vast majority of men, if they ever do get a match, they spent a lot of time and effort for a pretty meager \"payout\".  If a guy like that is friends with one of the guys that seems to easily attract women, he's probably jeoulos and impressed.  If the way matchups happened was even - the most attractive (or whatever) 2 paired off, then the next two, etc. all the way down the line, then the \"whore\" vs \"player\" complaint would be more legit.  But instead it's something like for each time a women hooks up with a \"hawt\" guy, he's hooked up with a dozen women.  For every time an average guy hooks up, that women he's hooking up has hooked up with a dozen other guys.  So it's very skewed.  \n\nBeing called a player isn't exactly a compliment either.  I was accused of being one once in my life - after I broke up with a gal, a friend of hers left a nasty message on my machine basically accusing me of pumping and dumping and being a player.  Nothing more than kissing ever happened.  I broke up with her after 6 weeks once I realized I was never going to marry her.  I guess only women are allowed to do the breaking up.",

I have fought for equal rights most of my life and I wanted to just talk about some really big issues in our patriachry (In the terms I use it, I mean the way society is built to fuck everyone in the ass lol)\n\n\\-The fact that female abusers dont get caught and are given lesser sentences makes my blood boil. I dont care the kind of abuse or if it's a guy or girl doing the abuse, the abuser needs to go to jail and face punishment.\n\n\\-Male victims being taken less seriously than female victims is deeply upsetting. I have a friend who is a male survivor of sexual assault and it breaks my heart how people have treated him in the past because of the sexual assault.\n\n\\-Fake claims of sexual assault. Again, pisses me the fuck off and makes actual female victims less likely to speak up (Amber Heard, I'm looking at you, you stupid bitch). Personally, my only expierence with someone faking sexual assault/abuse was a guy. Again, I dont care about gender and it shouldn't matter. If someone lies about assault, send their ass to jail.\n\n\\-Fathers losing custody and child support. I'm of the opinion that if a man never wanted kids, he doesn't have to pay child support at all. He did not consent to kids and should be able to back out of the pregnancy the same way a woman can. As for custody, the court should not favour the woman simply because she's the mother. They should look at it as \"who is more suited to be a parent and can provide the best life for the child\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I haven't made it clear, I do not care about the gender, sex, sexual orientation or race of the person commiting the crime. I care about the crime. There should not be favours to men or women in court in anyway whatsoever. Maybe my views are skewed, but i don't use the patriarchy as a thing that makes men privileged. It makes a few rich and powerful men more rich and powerful, but again, fucks average guys and girls. The fact that guys cant show emotions, aren't \"real\" victims, cant get hurt, etc., are all problems with the patriarchy. Maybe feminist is the wrong term but I use it as a way for equal rights, since thats the name its been called since the beginning. I believe in mens rights, womens rights and more. The fact that this sub exists make me happy because there is a place for men to talk about the issues affecting them just like so many women have their spaces to talk about issues affecting them.\n\nSorry if this is confusing lol, just wanted to explain my point of view to some people and would be happy to accept dms from anyone!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: thanks sm everyone for the kind comments! To clear some things up: I am looking at stepping away from the movement because of all the toxic people who are men-hating assholes as I don't want to be a part of a group that is like that. as for the term Patriarchy, I'm sorry if I offended anyone but in my comments I explain how I view the so-called patriarchy. If there is a better term for what I'm describing please let me know ASAP, since I am aware what I'm describing isn't the classic patriachry but it's the closest term I got lol! ",

Thus the feminine trait of being emotional may, at least back in the more prehistoric times that we're talking about, be outside their ability to control. Making them more a victim of their bodies (I apologize for how that likely comes off given the whole women and victimization issues, however back at times when the wheel was a troubling concept, I don't think it was easy to fight against more extreme emotions), as a result being selfish as a result from such internal conflicts they rightly cannot be blamed for (again, talking pre-historic times, today we are far more capable, so may or may not be applicable).\n\nDuring these more emotionally tolling periods of times the women would need to have their emotional needs attended to because guess what? They needed to attend to something that is completely important, the children. If you have someone who's undergoing some powerful emotions are you going to tell them to shut up when talking to you and then tell them they have to take care of a newborn perhaps alone? Might have a dead baby when you come home. Stress can cause people to snap after all.\n\nAgain talking about a period of time when a concept of fire or the wheel were basically quantum physics, can't rightly expect them to have the mental discipline needed to be able to handle themselves when their bodies start throwing hormones in every direction.",

Being a caregiver is not a a 'selfish' trait as you seem to be implying, as well the masculine traits weren't for the good of everyone, the men didn't go out, hunt, and then equally share their food with the weaker males who didn't get any food, I am not saying that there wasn't any food sharing however anyone who shared their food 100%, akin to an economical communist situation where everyone gets the same amount, people would die and thus they wouldn't 'count' as they died out before they could become us. It was a very harsh environment for everyone, the men took care of their 'family' (though family could mean tribe, and likely the men would hunt in packs due to the fact that humans strongest aspect is their intellect, which was far from what it currently is back then), and the women took care of the children. Without the 'feminine' trait of being 'motherly' do you know what would happen to the children who lack the ability to do anything other than cry, poop, and eat basically? They'd have probably died, which means no future children.\n\nThe masculine traits allowed the adults, man or women, to survive. The feminine traits allowed the children, boy or girl, to survive. If the adults died so did the children, if the children died then there would be no adults in the future and we would never exist. BOTH sets of traits were needed for YOU to exist. They worked TOGETHER to CONQUER the harsh environments filled with lions, tigers, and bears, unless you're saying that as a new-born the boys could go out, wrestle bears, win, and feast from the corpse.\n\nEdit: Almost forgot. I do apologize if I am getting off topic too much, however no one is served by allowing information which is false to go unchallenged, no real 'points' were brought up here other than suggesting that women even back then were basically just self-involved. As a result I am challenging the idea with this because I find it to be completely untrue, and hope that the truth, whether it be mine or not, is made known to whomever cares to hear it.",

The masculine traits were needed to not say get eaten by a tiger, starve to death, or anything like that, the feminine traits were however needed to care for young so that they had a chance to grow into strong men and not starve to death (since back then a baby could ONLY get food from the mother, at least until a certain age), the women had to stay home, and a number of the 'feminine' traits (like being more in touch with emotions and being a 'better' care-giver and attending to the house) were likely the result of biology (since hormones with pregnancy would probably have a more obvious effect when the mental capabilities of ALL people, men and women, were DRASTICALLY lower than what we have now) and situation and stuff.\n\nSorry about that however the point that masculinity is required to create where we are, WHILE IS 100% RIGHT, was not able to do so alone, and it is important to recognize this. These same roles that were done back then are the basis of the gender roles we have today, because humans had to fit into these roles or die. If men let their emotions overcome them, they would not be proper hunters, they'd get eaten, the women and children would die, if the women went out hunting even if she was actually good at it, would be leaving the child defenseless and hungry and it would likely die thus the man/women pairing has no impact on our society today since they were before the time when stuff was recorded. Blah blah.\n\nAlso I think that perhaps this same gender role situation may be a bit as to why feminism is a bit vindictive (I recall hearing before they could vote they fought against the right for blacks to vote on the basis that they couldn't) could be affected by the more 'emotional' level allowed to the people who run it (Just a thought no real basis for this conjecture) and why you have people who want 'equality' under the same banner as people who want to 'kill all men' and no one does anything to really change it aside from saying, \"I'm not one of THOSE people\".

The reason however I pointed it out was because given those two things it seemed to me that you, either intentionally or unintentionally, that you were trying to underlay the men's issue being stated (treated a man as a criminal for being men) because you had a bias towards it more akin to it being 'normal'.

Society is a very complicated thing, and it is important to note that everyone faces a level of discrimination if only in how they are told they aren't supposed to deviate from their gender roles (since anyone born outside the classic two gender roles faces other issues so no one is 'immune' to this sort of biased societal thinking), the point that I was more disagreeing about you didn't really argue with here.\n\nMen tend to be painted moreso as 'criminals' or 'evil', in fact by women being painted as 'pure' they are many times PARDONED from actions which are completely wrong and at times illegal (even if only in fictional settings like on TV where they perhaps have a women jokingly assault a man for humorous reasons). Treating women like they must protect their purity and they can do no evil is wrong and it will hurt women who are more 'morally grey' as they'll likely be scrutinized by others, even if said others don't realize it, for not conforming to their prescribed gender role. The point I was more of making is that men are painted as more evil, the 'good' parts of OP's post (again I don't agree that we should get special treatment for being men as you yourself said) is pointing out how sorta men have protected women in the past allowing our society to grow, and yet here we are now telling men they are 'evil' once they are no longer needed to protect. This is 100% wrong.\n\nThis is not the WHOLE issue obviously, I will not suggest it, however the fact that there exist OTHER issues does not mean that this issue does not exist, in order to create a purely equal world we must ACKNOWLEDGE and address EVERY issue of discrimination. Perhaps the one OP pointed out is not one that can/should be addressed now, however OP started a conversation about this issue, and I find it a bit.... inappropriate to step into OP's conversation and say how their 'good' point that you AGREE with shouldn't be talked about basically by saying \"girls have it worse!\"\n\nThough I am probably reading too much into your post, and since in my other posts outside this comment tree I myself took conversation off topic and continued to discuss it, I do apologize for feeling any amount in which you did that is inappropriate as yours does still in turn relate to the topic, talking more so about the other side of the coin.

I find, though, that sex education in the United States actually treats girls worse by, in some places, telling them that every partner they have makes them lose a \"petal\" on the pretty metaphorical flower that represents them or the love they can give. It treats women as these fragile creatures that must abstain to maintain their \"purity\". Religion treats sexuality, specifically women's, even worse.

It also explains why there is opposition to gay marriage and why women are still viewed as weak. It's because women did take on the submissive, weaker roles for the majority of history and only strong men who could reproduce and create more strong men were of use to society.

I know school is out so we arent getting some of the best responses and maybe you were actually taught this in the feminist run schools but in the interest of truth....come on.\n\n> They weren't allowed to go to school\n\nActually there was never a time in the US at least where women werent educated.  Even in ancient fucking Rome were little girls educated.  Like all things education followed more closely to class than gender with the upperclass of either gender generally being highly educated.  Ancient Egypt was just as egalitarian...maybe even more so.  Even ancient babylon (which is as far back as writing goes) educated women.  Before that Im not sure what the hell humanity knew that you had to be taught in order to know.\n\nDo you have some kind of source of some countries in the west where they werent allowed to be educated?  And how they were excluded by gender AND NOT BY CLASS?  because everytime I go to look it up I find girls were educated as much as boys were, unless they were fucking poor then they were sold.  Except unlike boys they generally werent disposable.\n\n> Also they got passed off into marriage and babies at extremely young ages, like as soon as they got their period. This stunted their development and gave them huge responsibilities at young ages. This would drain their energy and ability to be creative.\n\nYou act like they would have not gotten pregnant if they hadnt gotten married.  As though back in the past teenagers wouldnt be having sex outside of marriage and thats some new modern bullshit.  Lets put that in perspective:  Do you remember how much everyone laughed at schools \"Abstinence only\" sex ed?  At some point in the 90's schools actually taught kids that the best way to prevent pregnancy and std's was just to abstain.  Yeah...its that fucking ludicrous and of course it had absolutely no effect on teenage pregnancy or anything because young people are NOT going to abstain.\n\nYoung people, including women, were GOING to have sex.  Marriage was society's way of insuring women would be cared for.  Women werent oppressed into marriage... women were protected and provided for during a period of time where they would be weak and dependent.  Im not sure you can imagine living in a time where if you got sex you would get pregnant and if you werent married then you may well fucking die but if you cant imagine a world like that (it was seriously just like 50 years ago) then youll just have to trust me when I tell you that a woman really really wanted to be married and wouldnt have sex until she was married....seriously, HUGE DEAL.\n\n> If you want to go way back, this probably started in the pre-human era where we were basically animals, and once the woman had babies she had to stay and take care of it, rather than go out and explore and be innovative. Men would become physically stronger from hunting and exploring and etc etc. the loop goes on forever.\n\nYou start off right and its true women had babies and were completely dependent on SOMEONE else to take care of them and its fair to guess this (and the advent of agriculture) is where the gender roles started.  It is just biology.  But then this:\n\n> Men would become physically stronger from hunting and exploring and etc etc. the loop goes on forever.\n\nMen are just stronger.  Have you ever wondered why almost all sports involving strength are segregated by gender?  Looked up the match between Karsten Braasch vs each of the Williams sisters.  The Williams sisters made some boast that they could beat any man not in the top 200 so Braasch takes them up on it. He plays a round of golf, smokes, and then schools them.  Despite being 15 years older than them.  Im not trying to brag, both genders are capable of truely amazing things but its dishonest to say women, in general, could develop to be anywhere near as strong as men, in general.\n\nFinally, I dont really like how you imply it could have gone any other way.  I feel thats really disingenuous.  So youve got two people in a household.  To provide for a household the work is manual labor and it is really physically taxing.  Now this is true for literally tens of thousands of years.  For all of human existence this has been the rule and not the exception.  Of the two members of the household, one member of the household makes babies and then literally squirts out food for babies like right out of her fucking body but is much weaker than the other one.  The other is stronger and does not squirt out food for babies... like seriously ITS ON FUCKING TAPS on the other one.  Now of these two, one of them has to plow the field (or hunt the mammoths or fight the philistines or do some other dangerous and shitty job) and the other has to take care of the babies.  So of these two members, youve got the one thats literally makes the food on tap from her body or the one thats disposable.  Which one do you send out into the gaping maw of civilization to be chewed up and broken so civilization can move forward another inch?",

Because that seems to be pretty standard feminist ideology.\n\n>*The fact that someone, somewhere, decided that women weren't capable and thus not allowed to vote is an example of the patriarchy.*\n\nYou are aware that the vast majority of men were not allowed to vote either until about 10 years before women gained the right? Are you saying that patriarchy existed for those 10 years?\n\n>*The idea of women wanting to break free of an evolutionary pattern, and society not wanting them to break free created the patriarchy.*\n\nAnd what of men who want to break free of our evolutionary pattern of providing for women?

Does that mean that they have created a Matriarchy by refusing to let me break free of providing my hard earned compensation to women?",

Efficiency.** If you admit that pre-industrial farming and blacksmithing take great strength and if you also admit that men tend to have a much greater potential for strength than women, then why wouldn't you assume that a primary reason why a father would train his son to blacksmith or farm and not his daughter is because he knew his son would grow to be strong enough to handle all part of the job more easily and more efficiently and that his daughter may not ever be able to grow strong enough to handle the work? Why would a pre-industrial laborer waste any time training someone to aid in certain skill areas? That isn't efficient at all. \n\n**2. Necessity.** You claim that \"we simply evolved such that men are stronger than women.\" This couldn't be further from the truth. The only reason why men evolved to be stronger than women is because the weak men died off and didn't have children. It may surprise you to learn that we have twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors. This means that men had fewer chances to pass on their genes and had to truly excel in order to do so. They had to be bigger, stronger, and faster than the next guy. That is why I am bigger, stronger, and faster than you are. Because our female ancestors didn't really have to do all that much to pass on their genes. They had a MUCH higher chance to procreate so they didn't have to excel. \n\n**3. Choice.** This also shows us what these societies likely looked like. Men worked incredibly hard because they had to constantly prove their worth in order to \"win\" the privilege to mate. What you, and frankly all feminists, seem to misunderstand or deliberately overlook, is that you are examining the past through a lens of privileged knowledge. You now KNOW what benefits come from working as a laborer. You look back on these societies and say \"I would have wanted to be trained as a blacksmith or a farmer\" but you never realize that the women who lived during that time probably didn't. These were women who didn't have to do much of anything to secure a mate. Do you really think they would want to work an incredibly physically demanding and seriously dangerous job instead of doing the relatively easy job of staying home and taking care of children? Seems like a pretty easy choice for someone faced with the very real possibility of dying every single day. \n\nBut you'd rather just blame it all on sexism? That men were actively keeping women out of these occupations while women were demanding to be able to work extremely physically intensive and dangerous jobs? Not likely.",

Women were typically not barred from any of the European guilds. However, the education process in the trades was onerous (involving years of indentured servitude as an apprentice starting in childhood, then years travelling as a journeyman often into the mid-twenties), and few women were interested in blacksmithing if it meant not marrying (which it probably did). The rosters of guilds reflected that--usually 1-2% women. \n\nEducation (reading/writing/math) is another silly thing feminists bring up. Up until the Renaissance, a lot of noblemen and kings couldn't be bothered to learn to read. It was a waste of time when kingdoms were won or lost by the sword, and you could pay someone to do your reading for you. One of the (hypothesized) reasons Ashkenazi Jews have the highest average IQ of any ethnicity was that in Europe, Jews were barred from many avenues to wealth/power that relied on physical strength, and the most successful of them (ergo, able to support the largest families) earned their success through white collar work, which takes brains, and the least successful were the least intelligent. Different selection pressures create different average traits in different demographics. This is not rocket science, though for feminists it might seem like it.\n",

This probably includes both indoors and outdoors work, both in farms and in factories.\n\nThis made housework and childcare less onerous (the older children are tending to the younger ones, so you don't have to - ie a big family is not a bigger problem to you than a small one).\n\nAnd 2), well, lots of women historically worked outside the home, in factories, as farmhands, as prostitutes, as maids, as teachers, and probably cooks for inns and such.\n\nThey probably did have children. As most everyone did. It wasn't just 15 years old girls working outside with everyone else being married, thus locked inside homes.\n\nIt's a recent standard to be able to have only one income (one which we seem to have lost). Even if the second income used to be normally more limited (as most women were confined to certain domains, that didn't pay as much). Only the upper middle class could afford to have both her stay home doing nothing with staff doing her housekeeping. Think Mary Poppins. The family she helps? They're that level of rich.\n\nAnd those women? They're amongst the first feminists. Bored and rich, and white privileged women. Having staff do their job, complaining about how their life sucks compared to men working themselves an early death. How do you think they had time to get educated, write books, organize meetings?

Work animals were used to travel, so when it came time to go to other properties, the man would go because he knew how to work the ox.\n\nI think this is one of Bem's weaker points, but that is the explanation she offers.",

Hunting didn't require that men range further out than women. Neither did patrolling territorial margins, or acting as the primary interface with neighboring (friendly and hostile) tribes. \n\nAmong nomadic tribes, it would never be the men who were in charge of community \"public sphere\" decisions, like which places offered enough game to settle in for a while and which didn't, or which places would be unsafe due to the presence of hostile neighbors. Men would not have been given the authority to, say, confine women and children to a specific area close to home, if predators or marauders were about. \n\nHunter gatherer societies would have given men NO public sphere power greater than women had...\n\nI'll grant that most HG societies were more egalitarian in the degree of social status they gave men and women, and that agriculture changed this. However, there were other influences on that shift than simply \"women didn't get out and interact with women\". Agrarian societies fixed wealth to a piece of land that needed to be defended, and allowed for a surplus of food that also needed to be defended, permanent shelters that needed to be defended, etc. Both sexes went from working half-days to full-days typically, and the added physical burden on men was much more significant. \n\nI also wonder what you mean about large farms leading to men interacting with each other more than women. I would expect that both men and women on larger farms wouldn't have much time to interact with anyone during their 14 hour long workdays--especially if it took hours of walking to do so.",

Rather, that whatever division was present wasn't built into reproducing gendered cultural practices because the necessity to divide labor along gendered lines wasn't motivated by any significant differences between men and women.\n\n>I don't know what you mean by naive...\n\nI mean that I am somewhat ignorant of the experiences and practices of pre-colonized native american women.

Human beings are, first and foremost, survival and reproduction machines.  Not only should these be (or be part of) the main principles by which we organize human behavior, they must be.  For any human whose behavior is inconsistent with these principles, drives himself and/or his potential progeny into extinction.  The same is true with any other species.\n\nFrom these principles flows certain important logical implications, namely the existence of a hierarchy of evidence.  Evidence that is consistent with these principles takes precedence over evidence which does not, because the later is either actually consistent with these principles and has been interpreted wrongly (making it less credible) or it describes maladaptive behavior which cannot exist for any extended period of time and therefore excludes itself from a comprehensive description of human behavior.\n\nAccordingly, we can observe the existence of sex roles in many other parts of the animal kingdom, particularly in the behavior of our closest primate cousins, and we observe that they are consistent with these main principles.  We take into account spermjack_attack's supposed evidence concerning early hunter-gatherer societies, and it appears inconsistent with these principles, and so we should regard it as inferior to the former evidence.

Hunting involved many different activities, both from accuracy(bow/sling/javelin), strength(spear/axe, carrying weight) and endurance(outrunning, or running longer than an animal, traveling distances weighed down with your pack or wounded huntspeople), all of which are physical activities.\n\nWould a female have just as much skill as a male hunter? It's possible, maybe even probable(but that's another discussion). But do women have the capacity for brute strength or endurance that men do? That answer is no. In your earlier analogy, you indicated that out of a group of 5, one male and four females, they brought down a bison. Who would be able to carry *more* of the bison back to town with them?

Humans became less healthy but more numerous. Once one tribe successfully outbreeds another, the others have to compete or be consumed... which means women breeding more and men working harder to support more children and women doing less resource acquisition.\n\nThis seems somewhat reasonable, and i don't think conflicts with Bem's theory. In fact, Bem's theory only suggests that the agrarian shift was *one* point in development of gendered labor.\n\nI understand native American history, but it's a little anachronistic to describe non-heteronormative native Americans as \"gay men.\" Seeming how much of their culture runs counter to modern heteronormativity. But I get your point. But I am naive about native women hunters, though I think I read somewhere about Mesoamerican tribes where women hunted, I can't recall the specifics.",

As labor divisions arose, labor forms became gendered. This proceeded from simple divisions of labor to modern organization of labor which reflect the gendered inequality we see today.\n\nThis explanation is supported by the fact that social inequality rises as societies become more specialized. Bem explanation is pretty good becuase it suggests that social inequality between genders doesn't require significant differences between genders. Rather, the emergence of inequality was slow, and the result of \"rational\" decision making on the part of individuals.\n\nThough, it's not as if Bem's explanation is without it's problems. She depends to much on psychological explanations of society, and in many ways it limits her analysis.\n\n",

The reason? Because the so called \u201cpatriarchy\u201d will always exist. If men have been in control all this time then why would they let women take over so easily? That\u2019s the thing, they wouldn\u2019t. Feminism was a way to get more women in the work place and to make already wealthy men wealthier. It also created an avenue to make women better consumers if they actually became an integral part of society instead of staying housewives. An example of feminism being used for profit is when commercials in the 20th century advertised cigarettes as \u201cfreedom torches\u201d to women. Again, these industries were owned by men. Men organized all of what you see today and they also showed women how to live in it. You have to understand that those who filled the textile mills during the industrial revolution were women and those who owned the industry were men. Today is no different. Women think that they are gaining more power through \u201csexual freedom\u201d when really they are just getting exploited by social media and pornography corporations owned by who again? Well men. White men to be exact. In fact, sex trafficking has gotten increasingly worse over the years and so called \u201csexual freedom\u201d is not helping (because the porn industry supports the underground sex industry). Many men today are addicted to pornography and more and more men are ditching real life relationships with women. Why? Because of capitalism. Because that\u2019s what creates profit. Women are nothing more than a tool in this money making process. Women think they are in the better spot because men thirst over their bodies (strangely some feminists think objectification is a good thing), but the truth is that they are a tool for social media and porn industries, which are owned by men. The industry owners know that they can bring in more male consumers (since men get turned on easily by visuals) by creating a hyper sexual society that uses women as a pull. Destroy the nuclear family and make men desperate for female attention (real or virtual) and now you have a money making system. It\u2019s fucked up, but it\u2019s reality. Feminism was a guise for profit. As they say, \u201cFollow the money\u201d and you will understand history.",

Early feminism mainly consisted of upper class women who wanted the benefits and independence of their husband's/father's lifestyle as barristers, accountants, and politicians.

Although they are different animals than apes, you can't just take one example like bonobos and then say that matriarchal society is more peaceful than patriarchal society. There has to be corroborative evidence as well. Even if one assumes bonobos are more peaceful than chimpanzees, the meaning of which is disputable, that means bonobos are more peaceful than chimpanzees, not that matriarchal society is more peaceful than patriarchal society. If over a wide range of animals it is found that matriarchal society is more peaceful, and there are no other major factors that make it so, other than the fact that they are matriarchal, only then can you go on to say that matriarchal society is more peaceful.",

Bonobos have a evolved brain and along with chimpanzees are the closes extant relative to humans. \nOther animals that can also be carnivorous- like hyenas should also be studied from this perspective for us to arrive at the conclusion that a matriarchal animal society is more peaceful than a patriarchal one, all other factors being irrelevant. However, if other factors that contribute to peacefulness compared to other species come into play the credibility of the claim is bound to be lowered. Also, because you mentioned the lack of male-male competition, that isn't true. Male male competition exists in bonobos. The mother of one male bonobo will mostly staunchly support him in conflicts with other males, and their mothers them. This might cause heightened conflict in Bonobo societies. Like I mentioned in the other comment, their advanced behaviour concerning empathy and sex is a result of trying to solve problems in the best way possible. It's not like they don't have conflict.",

A relative study found that western patriarchal chimpanzee relatively peaceful. It's the eastern chimpanzees that tended to show aggression. \n\nThe ranges of bonobos and chimpanzees are separated by the Congo River, with bonobos living to the south of it, and chimpanzees to the north.\u00a0It has been hypothesized that bonobos are able to live a more peaceful lifestyle in part because of an abundance of nutritious vegetation in their natural habitat, allowing them to travel and forage in large parties\n\nAnother point to add on:\nWhile bonobos are more peaceful than chimpanzees, it is not true that they are unaggressive.\u00a0In the wild, among males, bonobos are half as aggressive as chimpanzees, while female bonobos are more aggressive than female chimpanzees.Both bonobos and chimpanzees exhibit physical aggression more than 100 times as often as humans do. \nNote that female bonobos(the dominant group of the species) are more aggressive than female chimpanzees (the non-dominant group of the species). \n\nIf you missed my other comment: \nBonobo society is dominated by females, and severing the lifelong alliance between mothers and their male offspring may make them vulnerable to female aggression.De Waal has warned of the danger of romanticizing bonobos: \"All animals are competitive by nature and cooperative only under specific circumstances\" and that \"when first writing about their behaviour, I spoke of 'sex for peace' precisely because bonobos had plenty of conflicts. There would obviously be no need for peacemaking if they lived in perfect harmony.\"",
