Very inflatory i would imagine.\n\n\"The percentage of children living in extended family households that include grandparents is 38% worldwide\"\n\nAs i thought.\n\n>I'm not the one encouraging people to leave their kids alone on this mortal plane.\n\nReally? provide me the link where someone personaly asked me for advice on whether to jab themselves up or not, and i said they shouldnt?",

How far apart? Also, boosters don\u2019t add efficiency to prior doses of mRna. The schedule is for waning and loss of efficacy over time. It\u2019s a \u201cre-up,\u201d not a \u201cbuild up,\u201d and sometimes it\u2019s neither as different strains are sliding through like a hot knife in butter. You can feel how you want about mRna vaccines and the outcome of this data, and id have no emotion about it at all. But preemptively treating Covid is not a long term solution or one as well as treating it post infection. People will grow immune to spike proteins. We already see people fully vaccinated with a booster or two still suffering pretty strong symptoms. This is a crapshoot.\n\nEdited: context",

According to mainstream  media, 50% of Covid survivors will end up with long term symptoms, so rate of infections are the only thing that really matters.\n\nAt this point, with data from the UK, vaccinated people were 4x as likely to catch Covid.  The severity of infection has no impact on whether or not someone catches long Covid.  So per UK data, you can take a vaccine that maybe, just maybe will make your initial infections less severe, but also make you more likely to become infected thus increasing your risk of contracting long Covid.\n\nDoes it seem logical to accept a treatment that decreases the miniscule risk of severe infection in the short term but makes those that receive it more prone to long term symptoms at a must greater risk compared to short term benefits?  No it is not logical and there's really nothing you dumb asses can say that changes that.",

For obvious reasons, less restrictions means more covid cases. People ignore this aspect and look at two variables: Case numbers and vaccine numbers.

There is no disputing the fact that many more are dead from covid than the vaccine. That is even the case in Australia, despite 80%+ of people being vaccinated and 1% of people being confirmed to have caught it.",

Young people don't just get vaccinated to protect themselves, they get vaccinated to protect others. Not that you guys believe the science of vaccinations reducing the spread.\n\nthey found that protection against infection lasts 3 months and declines rapidly after that. After 6 months protection is negative that means you are more likely to be infected than the non-vaxxed.\n\nThat is what studies in the UK, Sweden, Qatar and Israel have found.  Another study found that on a country level there is no correlation between cases and vax rates. So the idea that you need to vaccinate to protect others is a fantasy based on poor understanding how the vax works. Everyone will be infected with this virus sooner or later and nothing will be able to stop that.\n\n>And replying to your edit above, I am sorry if you don't understand how your anecdote of a single person's heart issues, based on a tiny sample size of who you know is statistically completely irrelevant.\n\nI understand the limitations of small sample size but I also understand the limitations of using incomplete data and undercounting of adverse reactions that are a very common problem in most studies.\n\nHere is what I has happened in my social circle.\n\nWe have 1 case of thrombosis and 1 case of heart problems   post vax in our close social circle. In addition several people I have known for a while had close family members develop blood clots and other cardiovascular problems post vax. Several of such cases and the number of people that I know isn't huge.\n\nA close family member is a doctor and worked in one of the world's covid hotspots during the pandemic with thousands of patients. He had more people go to the hospital from problems caused by vax than people going to the hospital because of covid. He told me that most doctors don't report adverse reactions.\n\nOfficially the rate of blood clots post vax is 1 in 100000 and for heart problems it's 1 in 20000 maybe. So statistically it's unlikely that we would see that many cases if these adverse reactions were that rare. Either we were really unlucky or what is more likely is that most reactions to the vax are never registered or reported.",

What makes you feel the vaccine is so necessary, when you\u2019d have a 98% chance of survival at worst? \nWhat makes you so ready to happily believe this article, even though it\u2019s more obvious thinly-veiled propaganda?\nWhy even debate menstrual issues, when the vaccine doesn\u2019t work at all? \n\nSpare me with the reduction of symptoms. The intention of the vaccine, *like all others*, was disease prevention. Check out any article a year old from when they launched. Furthermore, the EUA was issued under the guise of disease prevention, specifically. I\u2019d argue that, given the vaccines failure to do that, the EUA should be pulled. This is to say nothing of treatments being buried and demonized as horse paste, which is further dirty pool to get their EUA pushed through in the first place. \n\nNow we have tens of billions of shots at the ready, and they are known to be ineffective at best.

With this flu you must be blinded by propaganda to get it, knowing the failures of mrna in the past and now clearly the failure in those who were foolish enough to be a lab rat.\n\nFor the time scale it's again bs.

I personally am hard to convince with cherry picked sources where I can actually read them.\n\nAfter that, you couldn't let it go, and you need to reply to everyone who ever replies to me to talk to them about me.\n\nOther debate subs wouldn't allow that sort of thing - if you are upset about the first debate, it doesn't matter. Stop following me around and talking shit about me outside my comment threads like a weird coward\n\n>Or when cdc and Biden stated you can\u2019t get sick?\n\nI am not american.

It's only so feared because anyone who died **with** covid was [counted as dying **from** covid](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-1-Guidance-for-Certifying-COVID-19-Deaths.pdf). Depending on your age you are most likely [perfectly safe from it.](https://datavisualizations.heritage.org/public-health/covid-19-deaths-by-age/)\n\n\n2.

Hard to believe people who care about none of this when they say their actions are because they care about others.\n\n\n3. The [main test they use is not accurate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32219885/), its [own creator admits this](https://off-guardian.org/2020/10/05/pcr-inventor-it-doesnt-tell-you-that-you-are-sick/),\u00a0 often and [easily giving false positives.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2095096/)\n\n\n4. The vaccines [haven't even been properly tested](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728?term=NCT04368728&draw=2&rank=1), and already show a steady decline in effectiveness according to Swedish studies, and which [Lord Fauci even admits](https://news.yahoo.com/dr-fauci-just-issued-urgent-201846228.html). Hell the testing can't even tell us [if the vaccines save lives](https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/covid-19-vaccine-trials-cannot-tell-us-if-they-will-save-lives/). Let us not forget the [terrifying VAERS data](https://www.skirsch.com/covid/VCage.pdf). And this is all with serious risks like [heart inflammation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html) and [general worsening](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.144.suppl_1.10712) of [heart conditions](https://www.thecardiologyadvisor.com/home/topics/acs/acute-coronary-syndrome-acs-biomarkers-mrna-covid19-vaccine/)\nand [blood clots](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-antibodies-cause-blood-clots-side-effect) among other concerns such as [sloppy data, untrustworthy companies, a lack of liability, and professional censorship](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/vaccine-hesitancy-medical-paradigms/). In fact, the [higher the vaccination rate the more excess morality](https://www.skirsch.com/covid/GermanAnalysis.pdf). BTW they want 55 years to release the information that led to approval of the vaccines. Imagine a polio vaccine that didn't last, came out in 1 year, and didn't keep you from catching, spreading, and possibly even still dying of polio, but had a risk of worsening your life as well, and data wouldn't be shared about its approval for 5 decades. It's further possible the way the shot has been treated violates the [Nuremberg Code.](http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/nuremberg/)\n\n\n5.

Pediatricians have warned against holding pox parties, however, citing dangers arising from possible complications associated with chickenpox, such as encephalitis, chickenpox-associated pneumonia, and invasive group A strep.[11][13][14] These serious complications (e.g. brain damage or death) are vastly more likely than vaccine adverse events.[15][16] Before the chickenpox vaccine became available, 100 to 150 children in the U.S. died from chickenpox annually.[14][17] In the UK, chickenpox vaccinations are not routine, and around 25 people die a year from the disease, with 80% of victims being adults, in the late 1990s.[18] The chickenpox vaccine is now recommended by health officials, citing vastly superior safety when compared with infection.[8][19] \n\nThank you for getting me to reconsider my position so it won't be so absolute in future.",

ALL of the mods are anti-vaxxers. Good faith debate almost never happens here. Every third post is a video with no debate question asked. \n\nIf your goal is to reach people who have been harmed by misinformation (the way our friends and family have been) you are better off sorting major subs by controversial on vaccine issues - this place is controlled and will make sure your correct information is only seen by people who are INCAPABLE of understanding it, let alone believing it . \n\nIf you're like me and just wanted to get more insight into the anti-vaxxer mind - you don't need to post to find that stuff out. \n\nAs far as rule breaking:\n\n3 separate people here have stalked my real life identity and their comments were not removed. Anti-vaxxers constantly insult others and nothing happens.\n\nThe mods themselves constantly break the rules, this is a direct quote from /u/Calithrix:\n\n\"Please get your head out of your ass.\"\n\nI asked the mods if there could be a pro-vax person on the mod team for balance (like how every other debate sub works that actually has good faith debate).\n\nTheir response?\n\n\"If you think that we should be \u201cfair\u201d by allowing COVID-propagandists become a part of this mod team, then you should be protesting every sub with a \u201cmisinformation\u201d disclaimer and make sure that every other sub has anti-vaxxers on their mod team\u2014especially COVID related subs. \n\nI'm done here, obviously you can't debate in good faith if the mods are also pushing propaganda and can't even enforce even debate between the sides - the mods don't even believ ethere are two sides, that we're just \"propagandists\".\n\nWe are bolstering their confidence and enabling them for no benefit, and its keeping the admins from seeing this sub for what it really is. \n\nEdges8 does a great job here exposing how no anti=-vaxxers can argue properly or have any understanding of the science. In every thread he is in, he consistently wins every debate he takes part in with valid evidence and with the commenter ALWAYS resorting to insults and saying he's being paid, with the comments NEVER being removed. \n\nI think its possible edges8 has gotten through to some pepole. Anybody with a decent IQ can see his arguments are superior and anti-vaxxers can't stand by anything they say. \n\nBut based on the mod team and the userbase ... i don't think any difference is being made.\n\nI learned a bit about anti-vaxxers posting here, and its given me more confidence conronting family/friends knowing that even the \"smart\" ones cannot defend their views and have no ability to go even 3 sentences on topic without lying or insulting. I also got a chance to see anti-vax \"Sources\" to find out what they considered real information.\n\nSo it wasn't a total lost cause.\n\nBut there is no reason a pro-science person should post to this anti-vax sub that has no interest in fostering debate between the two sides. Posting here is a noble but fruitless cause."

This is assuming there won't be problems later (which there might be). \n\nI looked up some of the lot numbers of my loved ones. In almost every case, the first shot had little to no deaths. The second one way way worse.\n\nIt's also been proven that the deadliest batches were dispatched to red states (in the US). If one was a \"conspiracy theorists\", one might think it was a part of a political attack. \n\nYou can look up your lot numbers at:\n\nhowbadismybatch.com",

Based on what ive seen my null hypothesis is theres a lot of exaggeration of negative outcomes because people tend to do that. More people seem to think the vaccines are perfect due to propaganda of course but i see what i think is exaggeration on both sides\nOf this.\n\nMost people seem totally unfazed by covid and the vaccine. I agree with you that anecdotes vary but just take famous people for example. Either they are faking it or the vast majority got vaccinated\u2026 so if you believe theyre in on a secret and not getting vaxxed then i certainly cant prove otherwise\u2026 but if not, they mostly got vaxxed and not many bad adverse events so it seems. Not none and for sure many would hide if possible (gavin newsome getting bells palsie perhaps?). \n\nBut looking at a population like that, who are generally on the healthier side, and not seeing them drop dead alleviates some of the your anecdotes are different than mine concern, since we can all see info about famous people.",

She came up with what she felt was  conservative estimate of one unique instance of a \u201cside effect of special interest\u201d for every 1,900 vax doses. That category of side effects were usually fairly severe or serious, not just arm soreness, mild fever, etc. she was also appropriately conservative in counting the number of *unique* cases, meaning if someone had 3 different side effects, it would only count as one unique instance.\n\n1:1900 may seem like pretty good odds, and certainly explains the variability in people knowing or not knowing others who\u2019ve been affected, but 1:1900 is a staggering number for a mass-administered vaccine. \n\nTaking 1:1900 as correct (I think it\u2019s likely low, given the short time frame covered by the study in question) OWID says 64.2% of the world population has been vaxxed. Google says pop is 7.9 BB. Doing the math, ~27 million people will have had serious side effects. \n\nWe don\u2019t know how many people have suffered long-term problems from COVID infection, but 6.1 MM have died. Undoubtedly a goodly multiple of that have long-term negative effects. But the fact that potential vaccine injury is even in the same order of magnitude as injury from the illness is insane and totally unprecedented.\n\n(BTW, Kim Iversen is very worth watching. I think she\u2019s right of center, but she does actual journalism, shows her sources and AFAICT really tries to present facts and truth rather than spin and talking points. The Internet needs 50 more like her, on both sides of the divide \ud83d\udc4d)",

            "body": "> IF vaccines are...lets say the opposite of safe, how come the majority of vaxxed people are not dead\n\nThis is a valid question and I think is illustrative of how modern medicine operates. You first have to realize that a lot of government health policy is focused on the entire population and not individual people. So if they screen for diabetes, they are only going to find a few people out of hundreds of people that they test. Another example might be IV drug users catching HIV from a dirty needle, not every needle is contaminated, it's more about what happens across thousands of people.\n\nSo when talking about any drug (including vaccines), what does it really mean to be \"safe\"? If one out of every million people dies, is that safe? Like there is no doubt in anyones mind that the drug caused the death, but the circumstances were so rare that only one in a million will die, then whats the appropriate label for the drug? What if 50 out of 100 people die, does that mean that the drug wasn't safe for the 50 people that survived?\n\nSo when vaccines are being discussed, they reference safety on the basis of a population. It's safe for the population, but it can still be deadly for specific individuals. \n\nIn a perfect world they would screen people for certain factors that lead to death after taking a particular drug or vaccine. However screening costs money and if you add up these costs, then the vaccines no longer are worth the expense. For vaccines to be the choice, they have to be the cheapest method of treating disease. Otherwise if given the choice between an expensive vaccine or a cheap treatment, they will go with the cheaper alternative.\n\nSo at the end of the day, the medical system can't make safety decisions for individuals, only for the population. Each individual therefore must assume responsibility for their own individual safety.",

I hope the dupe is ok by the rules, LMK if it isn\u2019t (I\u2019m not highly experienced in Reddit or it\u2019s rules\u2026)\n\nKim Iversen did a good analysis of the possible risk ratio on The Hill\u2019s Rising show, based on a released Pfizer doc everyone is talking about: https://youtu.be/T0L360W5bc0\n\nShe was upfront that it was a bit of a SWAG, but she looked at the vax rates from Your World In Data to come up with an approximate number of vaxxed in the time frame of the report. She came up with what she felt was  conservative estimate of one unique instance of a \u201cside effect of special interest\u201d for every 1,900 vax doses. That category of side effects were usually fairly severe or serious, not just arm soreness, mild fever, etc. she was also appropriately conservative in counting the number of *unique* cases, meaning if someone had 3 different side effects, it would only count as one unique instance.\n\n1:1900 may seem like pretty good odds, and certainly explains the variability in people knowing or not knowing others who\u2019ve been affected, but 1:1900 is a staggering number for a mass-administered vaccine. \n\nTaking 1:1900 as correct (I think it\u2019s likely low, given the short time frame covered by the study in question) OWID says 64.2% of the world population has been vaxxed. Google says pop is 7.9 BB. Doing the math, ~27 million people will have had serious side effects. \n\nWe don\u2019t know how many people have suffered long-term problems from COVID infection, but 6.1 MM have died. Undoubtedly a goodly multiple of that have long-term negative effects. But the fact that potential vaccine injury is even in the same order of magnitude as injury from the illness is insane and totally unprecedented.\n\n(BTW, Kim Iversen is very worth watching. I think she\u2019s right of center, but she does actual journalism, shows her sources and AFAICT really tries to present facts and truth rather than spin and talking points. The Internet needs 50 more like her, on both sides of the divide \ud83d\udc4d",

Through smaller blood clots which can go undetected for a long time until they travel to the heart or any other organ where they become deadly - most people who will die from the vaccine, it will be because of that.\n\n5. A few years plus through vaccine induced AIDS that will slowly destroy the recipient's immune system and leave them vulnerable to all other infections. That remains to be seen.\n\nThe wild card is when the vaccine does the opposite than it is supposed to do, when catching the virus in the wild, and it kills you. That will happen whenever you catch the virus, and it might not be so rare.\n\nIn any case, I believe plenty of people received placebos without knowing it, instead of the real vaccine.",

We should look at the \"trend\" of data from the large amount of people educated in this field. There are always going to be a certain amount of dunces in every field, but it doesn't mean we have to throw out everything because of them. In this case, we have the entire worlds scientific organizations scientists focused on Covid and vaccination. \n\nIf there's a subject that takes years of studying to achieve knowledge on then what option do you have? \n\n>And, since I have access to the same knowledge as anyone else, for the most part these days due to the internet, I see no reason to consign all of my critical thinking abilities over to someone else. That is irresponsible in the highest degree.\n\nIf you're saying you have all the knowledge you need of virology, mrna and everything related to this vaccine via the internet, then I don't know what to tell you. The actual knowledge is something you need to be educated on for a long time. You can't just get a job into this field because you have access to the internet, that's ridiculous. \n\n>With that said, I have no issues with other people doing this. I am able to comprehend the things I read, not everyone can do that, and if you can't, then sure, just leave it up so someone smarter than yourself. That's not me, though.\n\nFirstly, I feel like your objection to the vaccine may be based on what other people are telling you to think, and not on your own incentive of actual educated analysis of data. Secondly, What I'm saying is that the vast majority of people educated in this field probably know a lot more than you. So I would take their word any day over yours. I'm not self centered enough to believe that I know better that world wide science in this field. Think of something you have talent and experience in, and then think about someone that has no experience in that field saying they know as much as you because they have the internet? They are pretty dumb, right? In your field, if some government organization tried to pull some stunt where they mislead the entire worlds people on something, then wouldn't you reach out to the internet? Wouldn't there be a massive uprising of people in your field saying it's bullshit?",

There are credentialed doctors on both sides of the equation\n\nHonestly, one of my biggest points ever is that we should leave this to the scientists educated in this field. I think the argument this subreddit is centered around should be contained to this idea -- are the majority of scientists educated on this topic pro vax or anti vax. We shouldn't be trying to interpret random statistics that we are not educated on. We should try to identify what percentage of people educated in this field would be pro covid vax vs anti covid vax. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>you can run parallel studies for sure, but they're not the same as consecutive studies.\n\nHaving said the above, I will answer you question here. No, the trials that were done met the criteria. Science has to meet criteria. Releasing a vaccine has to meet criteria. The point is, money can fast track the process. The idea that many things are conducted slowly because of resources is not an idea out of this realm. It's not an idea outside of this realm that the normal process could be fast tracked with world wide cooperation.  \n\nIt took like a year to approve the first vaccine for use. How long do you think it should have taken?\n\nThere are a ton of sources that explain how it occurred faster (including the one I posted). If you have a problem with what they are explaining then point out what they have done wrong. What you are suggesting is that world wide science that are educated in this field not only don't have any ethics whatsoever, but they are vaccinated themselves and their families anyway?",

            "body": "> ACE2 is present in the alveolar epithelium and is the receptor for SARS\u2013CoV-2 via the spike protein.3 Following binding, there is decreased availability of ACE2 and therefore decreased activity. This downregulation of ACE2 by COVID-19 results in increases in the substrates of ACE2, AngII and BK.6 COVID-19 infection also shows evidence of an increase in HA synthase 2 expression which will upregulate the production of HA and can lead to fluid retention and decreased gas permeability and acute respiratory distress syndrome often seen in COVID-19 patients.6,8 In response to the infection, the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, is upregulated. This overexpression of IL-6 indirectly causes an increase in B1Rs on the cell surface and also indirectly causes the downregulation of SERPINA12, a suppressor for bradykinin, subsequently increasing the cell\u2019s affinity for the uninhibited bradykinin.

Don\u2019t have a lot of time right now so I\u2019ll have to revisit this comment to lay out more premises to show that this risk is even greater for those who are vaccinated. For now I\u2019ll say my concern is related to the expression of spike in vaccinated people:\n\nhttps://dpbh.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/dpbhnvgov/content/Boards/BOH/Meetings/2021/SENEFF~1.PDF\n\nAnd we at least need more data and modeling on long term risks:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7827936/",

Biology is complicated and often unpredictable.  I think their ideas could really give *pause* to those open enough to their ideas - oh  shoot, what could these vaccines possibly do?

It doesn't mean the authors are lying, or reaching to the point of obscurity/dishonesty - in an open and fair system, they would be taken seriously and these products would be investigated further\n\nI agree with you OP.

In some cases, they link to other vaccines, old mRNA technology, or COVID-19 infection, but are not directly linked to mRNA vaccines.\n\nIn fact, so much of their evidence is from papers on severe COVID-19 infections, not vaccination, much content in this article might be better suited to a paper pointing out potential downstream dangers of severe COVID infections rather than raising alarm about mRNA vaccination.\n\nA number of places in the article seem to make stronger statements linking mRNA vaccines to some of these processes, but they self-cite a previous review article by senior author McCullough and do not reference any primary biological research making these connections.\n\nThey suggest connections of these mechanisms to various anecdotal case reports for herpes zoster reactivation, liver damage, optic neuropathy, T cell lymphoma progression, Hepatitis C reactivation, events not yet confirmed to be related to mRNA vaccination.\n\nThe paper amounts to laying out a series of hypotheses about mechanisms of harm that may come from mRNA vaccines.  Hypothesis generation is a valuable exercise, including in this context of understanding downstream biological effects of vaccination that might induce harm.\n\nHowever, not all hypotheses are equally justified.  Some are well-girded in direct evidence from relevant studies, while others are more speculative and extrapolate principles from other settings, e.g. SARS-CoV-2 infections or other injected vaccines, as done here.\n\nIndeed the speculative nature of their exploration is implicitly acknowledged by the authors in their choice of wording throughout, including \u201cis plausible\u201d,\u201cone can speculate\u201d,\u201cmight be a mechanism\u201d,\u201cone can hypothesize\u201d,\u201cit appears\u201d, \u201cwe expect\u201d, \u201ccould eventually lead to\u201d, etc.\n\nIt seems that rather than \u201cestablish a mechanistic framework\u201d, this paper simply lays out speculative mechanistic hypotheses with little direct connection to mRNA vaccines.  Hypotheses to validate, not principles to assume true unless disproven, as their conclusion implies.\n\n\"*We call on the public health institutions to demonstrate, with evidence, why the issues discussed in this paper are not relevant to public health, or to acknowledge that they are and to act accordingly.*\"\n\nTheir conclusion uses the classic \u201cshifting the burden\u201d trick, presuming that it is the responsibility of the scientific community to disprove their hypotheses rather than their responsibility to prove it.   This tactic has been common in the pandemic.\n\nThe entire last part of the paper presents results from VAERs attempting to \u201cstrengthen\u201d a causal link between mRNA vaccinations and broad classes of pathologies, including nerve inflammation, heart disorders, liver disease, thrombosis, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.\n\nTheir case for causation is driven by their claim that the mechanisms discussed in this paper represent \u201ccausal pathways\u201d, the fact that most VAERs reports occur soon after infection, and that the vast majority of VAERs reports in 2021 are from COVID, not other vaccines.\n\n\"*In mining VAERS for \u2018signals\u2019 that might indicate adverse reactions (AEs) to mRNA vaccinations, we acknowledge that no report to VAERS establishes a causal link with the vaccination. That said, the possibility of a causal relationship is strengthened through both the causal pathways we have described in this paper, and the strong temporal association between injections and reported AEs. Nearly 60% of all mRNA-injection-related -AEs have happened within 48 h of injection.*\"\n\nThis follows a line of argument used by others that the only possible explanation for higher VAERs reports close to time of injection is vaccine causation, ignoring that events immediately following injection are more likely to be considered vaccine related and thus reported.\n\nThey step through their chosen symptom categories and list what % of VAERs reports in 2021 were for COVID rather than other vaccines, supposing that high % indicates that event is \u201cespecially significant as a potential toxic effect of these vaccines\u201d\n\n\"*We decided that a reasonable way to characterize the significance of adverse events linked to COVID-19 vaccines was to focus on events received in the year 2021, and to compare the counts in the \u201cSYMPTOM\u201d field for the events associated with COVID-19 vaccines to the total counts for that same symptom for all vaccines over that same year.*\"\n\nOf course, this approach assumes that event reporting rates in 2021 do not vary across vaccine type, i.e. that COVID vaccines are not more likely to be reported to VAERs than flu or other vaccines, a highly dubious assumption.\n\nHere, from various negative control events looked up in VAERs, we can see that indeed reporting is higher for COVID than other vaccines across the board, unless you believe that vaccines cause toothaches, urinary incontinence, Xrays of limbs, or baldness.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n32vg6nyqgw81.jpg?width=1171&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0989f6ad1b7f5af7fb269c48213c180ae686922\n\nResults from several symptom categories demonstrates how their conclusions tend to overreach and ignore important confounding effects.\n\nHere are nerve inflammation symptoms they analyzed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/le5sm0d0rgw81.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=839c0d48d5a2dae5efb59c7af29f9dc5ce13d46f\n\nOne nerve inflammation symptom is anosmia.  They claim this \u201cclearly demonstrates\u201d the spike injected into arm reached the olfactory nerve, ignoring that anosmia is common with COVID-19 but not linked to vaccine, and could be caused by previous COVID-19 infection, not vaccine.\n\n...There were 3,657 cases of anosmia (loss of smell), clearly demonstrating that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein from the injection in the arm was reaching the olfactory nerve...\n\nHere are neurodegenerative disease symptoms they analyzed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g6y4bi71rgw81.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=265aff5675a21285046e17466cc362943279b435\n\nIn presenting neurodegenerative diseases, they acknowledge that they take decades to develop, yet imply some sort of connection with COVID-19 vaccines rather than considering the higher numbers for COVID-19 vaccines might be from higher reporting rates for COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\"*Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are diseases that normally take decades to develop, and ordinarily one would assume that a vaccine has nothing to do with it. While the numbers are small, most of the cases in VAERS were linked to COVID-19 vaccines.*\"\n\nThey conclude by suggesting these VAERs results reflect increased cancer risk from mRNA vaccination, citing their mechanistic hypotheses, in spite of the fact that cancer takes years to form, even after exposure to fallout from a nuclear weapon like in Hiroshima.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fgdvpal2rgw81.png?width=505&format=png&auto=webp&s=08d77c613990d01e0738302e84cf773ae54fb7e0\n\n\"*Cancer is a disease generally understood to take months or, more commonly, years to progress from an initial malignant transformation in a cell to development of a clinically recognized condition.*\"\n\n\"*However, as we have outlined in our paper, if the mRNA vaccinations are leading to widespread dysregulation of oncogene controls, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis, then VAERS reports should reflect an increase in reports of cancer, relative to the other vaccines, even if the numbers are small. The experiment demonstrating impairment of DNA repair mechanisms by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in an in vitro study provides compelling evidence that the vaccines could accelerate the rate of DNA mutations, increasing cancer risk (Jiang and Mei, 2021).*\"\n\nTheir suggestions that they have evidence that mRNA vaccines increase cancer risk and that their literature review in this paper indicate mechanisms of action further demonstrate the overreaching nature of the claims made in this paper.\n\nScientists have detected, validated, and characterized various minority harm risks of vaccines, including anaphylaxis/myocarditis for mRNA vaccines, and VITT/GBS for viral vectors.  Detection, validation, and characterization of any other risk is critically important.\n\nAnd deep characterization of the subgroups at highest risk of these serious complications, and of the severity and long-term effects of them needs to be highly prioritized research and considered in refining vaccination recommendations.\n\nStudies like this one integrating information from existing literature to posit hypotheses explaining these harms and others can be potentially useful.\n\nHowever the purported \u201cmechanistic frameworks\u201d laid out in this paper lack documented connections to mRNA vaccines, instead linking them to other vaccines, old mRNA technologies, or COVID-19 infections and speculating connections to mRNA vaccines.\n\nAdditionally, their case for vaccine relatedness is built upon flawed VAERs analyses that link higher reporting rates with significance as potential toxic vaccine effect, ignoring that events COVID-19 vaccination might be reported more often, as strongly suggested by the data.\n\nBottom line is that unless these assertions are validated, they should be acknowledged as hypotheses to investigate, not principles that should be assumed true unless disproven.  I have a feeling that is not how this paper will be represented and promoted on social media.\n\nStudies integrating information from existing literature to posit hypotheses explaining these harms and others are potentially useful, which this paper purports to do.\n\nHowever, the \u201cmechanistic frameworks\u201d laid out in this paper lack documented connections to mRNA vaccines, instead linking them to other vaccines, old mRNA technologies, or COVID-19 infections.  This makes their hypotheses speculative at best.\n\nThe bottom line is that this paper is comprised of a number of speculative hypothesis that can be viewed as unsubstantiated assertions.\n\nCertainly any paper proposing hypotheses needs to acknowledge they need to be investigated and validated, not assumed true unless disproven as the conclusion of this paper seems to imply.\n\nThis is especially true when the proposed hypotheses are as weakly supported as they are in this paper.\n\nThis is not how this paper will be represented, but the \"shifting the burden of evidence\" tactic will be used to oversell the evidence for its claims and try to suggest they have demonstrated biological principles and established risks that they clearly have not."

Because it is effective. 99.99% of the hospitalizations from covid are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals. That's nation-wide. The lowest reported percentage is Arizona with 94.1%. The news wants to communicate this because people are hesitant about getting the vaccine due to misinformation. Talking about the **miniscule** chance of adverse side effects is only going to make the general public less apt to get the vaccine.  There are people who have legitimate reasons to not get the vaccine and the only way we can protect them is through herd immunity. COVID won't be eradicated until a certain percentage of the population is immune, then the virus can't effectively spread and will die out. \n\nI started off by agreeing with you about the government mandate.  My issue is with your premise, though. \n\nThe information that you're offering up for evidence of the vaccine's side-effects is at best circumstanctial, if not purely anecdotal. The information is available to determine what the chances truly are.\n\nThis is probably one of the best tracked healthcare issues in the US to date, purely because of its spread during the information technology era. While the number of people who have had adverse side effects may number in the thousands, we have enough data points, statistically speaking, to calculate the odds of such an event occuring. The odds are miniscule. You have about the same chance as dying from a bee sting (.0016%). You're more likely to die in a mass shooting (.009%).  \n\nSo to suppose, as you said, \"all those\" people who were in good health that died, the, is not a sound basis for a convincing argument. \n\nThe chances are greater of contracting covid (using the lowest percent chance I could find of .05% which has been proven to be partially false) and dying than getting the vaccine and having an adverse side effect.*\n\n*The importance here is to look at the source for statistics, because they don't tell the whole story. The CDC requires healthcare providers to report any death that occurs with recency to the vaccine regardless of the cause of death. Car accident on your way home from the clinic, overdosing on blow, tripping and breaking your neck, all of those deaths, if they occured near the time when you got your covid shot, they must report. That's the .0019% chance I'm talking about. The number of deaths that are causal by the vaccine are most likely lower. The statistical chance of having an adverse side effect from the vaccine is significantly lower that .0019% chance due to this skewing of statistics. It logically follows that the chance of death from the vaccine is muuuuuch less than .0019%.\n\nEdit to add stats info.",

WE NEVER HEAR ABOUT THEM ON THE NEWS.  These folks share their experiences  online and get censored and removed. Doctors  being silenced with information about known cures.

One trend is blood clotting and low platelets, but is extremely small percentage. \n\nBecause of the skewed death reporting, you are less likely (percent chance) to experience myocarditis and pericarditis and all of the other reported health issues after getting the covid vaccine. \n\nLet's say that the deaths were all caused by the vaccine compared to an average 55 year old man. That's a .0019% chance vs a .0021% chance of an average male of 55 years of age dying on a given day. Compare that to a .05% chance of dying from covid (which is an inaccurate number, the chance is a little bit higher depending on where you live and your access to healthcare). You are 26 times more likely to die from covid than from the vaccine. \n\nThe verbage I disagree with is that the gov mandate is \"murdering people.\" It's a little ridiculous considering these statistics. The numbers overwhelmingly support getting the vaccine.\n\n\nSources: CDC.  NSC.org",

Those sheep in this country and the media that will spoon feed and organize censorship and the global billionaires that are pulling the Strings that are killing our children and families and friends, and leaving us helpless to fight for our rights, by censoring our every negative comments about what is happening now with this bio weapon vaccine. Buying commercials and false messaging about this being so safe and effective, is a death sentence.\nTomorrow will start the NYC NAZI- ism fear mongering by limiting us once more with our civil rights, by closing off our establishments  unless we provide vaccine proof.\nTotally UNBELIEVABLE!!\nMaybe these new recommendations In Nyc will provide enough truths to those who still don\u2019t believe and fail to see we are going backwards as a world and a nation and our rights as humans are being slowly revoked!!!\n\nWe will fight back, we will Resist!!!"
