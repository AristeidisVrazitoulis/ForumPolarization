You can spend all this time projecting but can't even lay out what document explicitly calls out the elites that are behind the climate change narrative? \n\n\nNot for nothing, but I did appreciate your reply a minute or two ago. The more I think though, the more I'm convinced it's a waste of my time. I don't pursue immediate gratification, nor validation of my \"conditioning\", nor some truth that makes you feel cozy about the state of the world. You are way off the mark here. \n\nI have lived off of a bag of rice for 3 months before to steady my mind eating one grain a day, I have hiked the Grand Canyon, the Rockies, the Andes, I have swam in lakes and ponds in 40 degree mornings, I've been robbed in Rio De Janiero, I've had guns pointed at me, I've seen Yosemite and Yellowstone, I've had nightmares and dreams that would make you think I'm clinically insane (and I definitely am), I've taken lethal amounts of psychedelics at concerts and festivals and seen shit you will never see. *Couple* this with the fact that I grew up in a place where no one goes outside after 2100 and drivebys were recurring. You ever have to go to the funeral after school? I have. I've had plenty of NDE's and only in those times have I appreciated my life to the fullest. The amount of times I could've perished but didn't, it's allowed me to garner an intense gratitude for the world we live in, for the life I live. Fuck anyone who tries to compare themselves to me, I used to do that as a child but learned quick that life is just different for me. \n\nReligion, in my eyes, has always been used as a political tool. The reason we have Greek translations of the old testament was ultimately to satisfy the jewish population who, through generations of acclimation, were no longer able to read Hebrew. Who cares where a word comes from? I've been led back to home by friendly Germans before, who are you to judge? Burn a Nazi flag in front of one of them and they'll join you in celebration. \n\nThe world *is* complex, there is no one framework that can ultimately capture the variance, no formula, no book, nothing. Whatever we witness, we witness in the past already. Adventure, wonderment, awe, inspiration, these things are merely states of mind. You confine the totality of human experience to papyrus scrolls, and hold the words of a few dead men over the thousands that followed them. I *detest* religion for this folly, it has it's place to consul suffering minds, but when used as something else and more, it's disgusting. You tell me the answer isn't in the back of a book and then tell me to read a book? Come on bro....I've spoken to God, he's an asshole just like the rest of us.",

However, most scientifically literate people can see the logistical, data, etc. flaws right away because those things are NOT founded on \u201cgood\u201d and actual science. Most normal people cannot. This is also a problem. There is a big disconnect between what research is and what most think it is. Hell, I didn\u2019t know for a long time either until I actually spent years doing it. And the sensational media of the moment further promote that idea. \n\nDoing actual hands on research is tedious, repetitive (because if you can\u2019t prove it happens all the time then you got nothing), underpaid as shit (I don\u2019t why people think we make money, unless you\u2019re like Doctor OZ or Foodbabe getting paid bank to be an influencer) and sooo much harder than people think. \n\nFor example, keeping human embryonic kidney cellls alive generation after generation in a sterile environment. Those are vital for proving something works in vivo vs just under a microscope. And that includes learning a lot of the times that what you thought was right was wrong, way before it gets published. \ufffc\n\nA while ago someone contacted me at work asking about an at home Covid test (before the rapid antigen ones were available\ufffc.) I basically told them unless they want to buy their own centrifuge, electrophoresis machine, thermocyer, pipettes, tips, reagents, precast gels, low temp freezers, etc (probably a total of 30k-50k at best) then going to the local\ufffc urgent care or pharmacy was in their best interest. \n\nBut going back to the original point about the disconnect between science and what people think it is. They thought that a covid test was you just swab it for a second then stick it in machine and it gives you a green light for good or red light for bad. \n\n\ufffcScientists act on the knowledge they have a hand at the moment. It does not mean that they are dead set in their beliefs because everyone of us knows our level of knowledge about something can change at any moment when some new (reproducible) evidence and we live for that\ufffc. \ufffc\n\nMost of us spend 20 years, 30 years, hell even almost whole lives, hoping that we will get proved right or wrong\ufffc. \ufffc\ufffc Because at least then we will have figured something out and that is all that science is about - Discovery and learning. \ufffc\ufffc Even when that means you were wrong. \ufffc\ufffc\n\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcAre there bad actors out there posing as scientists for some money? Yes. Please see the big name people I mentioned earlier as evidence for some. But do not paint us all with the same broadbrush because I guarantee you, all most of us do is care about the integrity of research and how it will end up helping people.\ufffc",

Clearly you're already aware of them.\n\nPfizer has been convicted of mislabeling drugs for almost 30 years. \n\n**Illegal marketing of gabapentin** - In 1993,\u00a0FDA approved\u00a0gabapentin\u00a0only for treatment of\u00a0seizures.\u00a0Warner-Lambert, which merged with Pfizer in 2000, used\u00a0continuing medical education\u00a0and medical research, sponsored articles about the drug for the medical literature, and alleged suppression of unfavorable study results, to promote gabapentin. Within five years, the drug was being widely used for\u00a0off-label uses such as treatment of pain and psychiatric conditions. Warner\u2013Lambert admitted to violating FDA regulations by promoting the drug for pain, psychiatric conditions, migraine, and other unapproved uses. \n\nIn 2004, the company paid $430\u00a0million in one of the largest settlements to resolve criminal and civil health care liability charges. It was the first off-label promotion case successfully brought under the\u00a0False Claims Act. A Cochrane review concluded that gabapentin is ineffective in migraine prophylaxis.\u00a0 \n\n**Illegal Marketing Of Bextra** - In September 2009, Pfizer pleaded guilty to the illegal marketing of\u00a0arthritis\u00a0drug\u00a0valdecoxib\u00a0(Bextra) and agreed to a $2.3\u00a0billion settlement, the largest\u00a0heath care\u00a0settlement at that time. Pfizer promoted the sale of the drug for several uses and dosages that the\u00a0FDA specifically declined to approve due to safety concerns. The drug was pulled from the market in 2005.\u00a0It was Pfizer's fourth such settlement in a decade. The payment included $1.3\u00a0billion in criminal penalties for felony violations of the\u00a0Federal Food, Cosmetic Act and $1.0\u00a0billion to settle allegations it had illegally promoted the drugs for uses that were not approved by the FDA leading to violations under the\u00a0False Claims Act as reimbursements were requested from Federal and State programs. The criminal fine was the largest ever assessed in the United States to date. \n\n[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer)\n\n\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-largest-health-care-fraud-settlement-its-history",

For example, in a cohort of oncology drug trials, industry funded 44% of trials, and 69% of authors declared conflicts of interest [1]. For a drug company, the financial impact of a positive pivotal trial can be substantial. One investigation reported that the mean stock price of the companies funding 23 positive pivotal oncology trials increased by 14% after disclosure of the results [2]. Several dramatic cases of biased industry trials have been widely debated [3]. These often involved selective reporting of outcomes and gift/ghost authorship. Other cases involved companies attempting to intimidate authors of independent investigations [4].\n\n[springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-018-5333-3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-018-5333-3)\n___\n>RESULTS  \nThe overall rate of disclosure was 71.2% (245 of 344 payments).

Such a practice also constitutes a COI.[20] In addition to the principal investigator (PI) those sub-investigators who are responsible for critical functions such as screening and randomization should also be assessed for COI.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4314841/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4314841/#:~:text=Among%20the%20commitments,assessed%20for%20COI.)\n__\n[Significant Differences between Conflict-of-Interest Policies of Medical Schools and Other Research Institutions.](https://www.nejm.org/na101/home/literatum/publisher/mms/journals/content/nejm/2000/nejm_2000.343.issue-22/nejm200011303432207/production/images/img_medium/nejm200011303432207_t2.jpeg)\n___\n>Dr. Reuben was one of the great experts in multimodal analgesia, but the scientific method requires the ability to duplicate results. With a fraud this vast, how come no one raise flags earlier, based on the inability of many clinicians to recreate his positive results?  The clinical impact of the fraud will be profound. Jacques Chelly, MD, PhD, MBA, director of the Division of Regional Anesthesia and Acute Interventional Perioperative Pain at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), **said that the fraud has left multimodal analgesia \u201cin shambles\u201d.** He added:\n\n>>\u201cthe big chunk of what people have based their protocol on is gone. We have stopped giving celecoxib and pregabalin to surgery patients until we have some very formal evidence that we should do something else. In this day and age, doing multimodal [therapy] is expensive. Any institution is going to look at evidence-based clinical decisions, and unless we have very strong data, it is a problem. Since most of evidence is now unreliable you really don\u2019t have any evidence that the combination is working.\u201d\n\n[Here is the list of fraudulent medical studies authored / fabricated by Dr. Scott Reubenz](https://i.imgur.com/E0hKkFq.png)\n\n(Multimodal analgesia is a pharmacologic method of pain management which combines various groups of medications for pain relief. The most commonly combined medication groups include local anesthetics, opioids, NSAIDs, acetaminophen and alpha-2 agonists.) - Hmm, interesting. More than a million and a half people killed with opioids and opioid addiction over the past couple decades...\n___\n>>Medicine in the US has become extremely proficient at many technically advanced diagnostic and therapeutic methods. However, they are often applied -- very competently -- to patients who don't need them at all. Can participatory medicine improve this situation? One way perhaps, is by facilitating actual informed consents (not merely legal rote signings) for therapeutic and diagnostic procedures, including screening tests and procedures.\n\nGeorge Lundberg, MD  \n[Why Healthcare Professionals Should Practice Participatory Medicine: Perspective of a Long-Time Medical Editor](http://jopm.org/index.php/jpm/article/view/31/23)\n___\n> Less than 10 percent of the institutions required initial disclosure to research sponsors or funding agencies; an even smaller proportion required disclosure to the IRB, journals, or collaborating researchers. Only three institutions required that financial interests be disclosed to research subjects. Fifty-seven percent of the institutions required disclosure if the investigator anticipated the possibility of a conflict of interest in the future.\n> \n> Only one institution had mandatory strategies for managing the initial disclosure of conflicts of interest. 43% of the institutions had policies that mentioned the possibility of disclosing details of the COI and its management to the funding agency or research sponsor. 59% of the institutions had policies that mentioned public disclosure as a possibility, but very few policies defined it, and none mentioned disclosure to the IRB or research subjects as a way of managing a conflict of interest.\n\n>CONCLUSIONS  \nThere is substantial variation among policies on conflicts of interest at medical schools and other research institutions. This variation, combined with the fact that many scientific journals and funding agencies do not require disclosure of conflicts of interest, suggests that the current standards may not be adequate to maintain a high level of scientific integrity.\n\n[A National Survey of Policies on Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest in Biomedical Research](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200011303432207#:~:text=on%20institutional%20discretion.-,CONCLUSIONS,-There%20is%20substantial)\n___\n[Bad news: sometimes the most rigorous published findings erode over time.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/13/the-truth-wears-off)\n___\n>>##If editors were to examine [the] body of literature [on the peer review process], they would discover that evidence on the upside of peer review is sparse, while evidence on the downside is abundant.

I\u2019m in my 30s and I\u2019m ready to have children soon. I don\u2019t want anything adversely affecting my fertility. Please share your opinions about this, especially if you have first-hand experience. Thank you! \ud83d\ude4f",

When a company gets such a massive boost in profits as the pharmaceutical companies got from the vaccine, they kinda need to keep those percentages up, so if they made a cure all vaccine, it would just make them a 1 time big bag, and they need consistent growth in profits.

Someone wanted lots of people to die and take as many others out with them as possible.\n\nAlso, this didn't stem from any single government or entity. The Chinese were alone in releasing it, and I don't think individual governments made the calls on how it was handled either.\n\nThis pandemic resulted in lots of cash bring funneled upward. That's no coincidence. It's never a coincidence.\n\nSo yeah, there's lots of bullshit surrounding the narrative we've been fed about COVID, but the vaccine isn't one. I mean, hell, they might have even had a vaccine available for the \"important\" people before they ever let the virus get out and propagate.",

I have a medical condition that requires a prescription that I simply cannot afford without insurance. I went online, found a bunch of decent jobs to apply foe, and did. Then, after I got a few offers I picked one. I had a new job lined up before I quit my old job. There was no period when I had no insurance. Chances are, if you're working a job with benefits, you have a skill that will allow you to find another job relatively easily. \n\nI understand, moving a family across the country isn't convenient. But let's be 100% honest here. Most people chose convenience over their so-called principles. \n\nThey also could have filed for medical or religious exemptions, and fought the fight in court. Like many people did.\n\nThey also could have got fake vaccine cards, like many people did.\n\nWhat I am sick of, is people allowing themselves to become victimized, and then expecting great sympathy. I am not exceptional. Anyone could have done what I did. They chose to become victims instead. \n\n>\"Jewish people didn't HAVE to get on the trains and go to concentration camps. They had a choice. They could have chosen to get shot instead.\" \n\nThey could have chosen to run, hide or fight, like many of them did choose. It wasn't like there weren't dozens and dozens of red flags and warnings before the Nazis started murdering them.\n\nI get it. The fact that they had a choice doesn't justify the actions of the Nazis. Nor does it justify the actions of our government and corporations.

The list includes acetaminophen, albuterol, aspirin, ibuprofen, Tylenol, Pepto Bismol, Tums, Lipitor, Senokot, Motrin, Maalox, Ex-Lax, Benadryl, Sudafed, Preparation H, Claritin, Prilosec, and Zoloft.***\n\n[https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20210918/some-medications-also-tied-to-religious-vaccine-exemption](https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20210918/some-medications-also-tied-to-religious-vaccine-exemption)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"This was significantly disproportionate to what we've seen with the influenza vaccine. ***Thus, we provided a religious attestation form for those individuals requesting a religious exemption,\" he said. \"The intent of the religious attestation form is twofold: to ensure staff requesting exemption are sincere in their beliefs and to educate staff who might have requested an exemption without understanding the full scope of how fetal cells are used in testing and development in common medicines.\"***\n\nConway Regional said the form also aims to notify employees of the requirements for compliance for an exemption, including signing the attestation form confirming their sincerely held belief, being subject to periodic COVID-19 testing, and possible reassignment to another position to mitigate risk to patients and staff.\n\n***The form lists 30 medications and asks employees to \"truthfully acknowledge and affirm that my sincerely held religious belief is consistent and true and I do not use or will use any of the medications listed as examples or any other medication \u2026 that has used fetal cell lines in their development and/or testing.\"***\n\n***Few religions outright reject vaccinations***, but some religious groups have raised the issue of vaccines being developed and tested on fetal cell lines, which are grown in labs based on aborted fetal cells, according to 9News, which spoke with an infectious disease expert at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.\n\n\"I understand why people have concerns,\" James Lawler, MD, the expert, who is a practicing Catholic, told the news station. ***\"The bottom line is almost all the medical products we use have in some way been touched by research that's been done on fetal cell lines.\"***\n\nMr. Troup said the purpose of the form is to be educational and \"provide information on other commonly used medications that may go against a sincerely held religious belief.\"\n\nIf someone declines to sign the form, he said their religious exemption is approved on a provisional basis, and the employee may be asked to sign the form at a later date.\n\n[https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/workforce/prove-it-hospital-asks-unvaccinated-employees-claiming-religious-exemption.html](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/workforce/prove-it-hospital-asks-unvaccinated-employees-claiming-religious-exemption.html)",

The problem is that the illegal orders are coming from the top and there are too many senior ranking officers who don\u2019t have a spine to fight it.

The only FDA approved covid19 vaccine is COMIRNATY which they don\u2019t have any supplies of.  One good officer got an exemption based on this very important fact.  I might know a thing or two about the U.S. military.  I retired after 22 years of service in 2013.  Even way way back in boot camp they explained the difference between legal and illegal orders and that it was our duty to not follow illegal ones.  The military that are being forced separated for not following illegal orders are heroes in my book.  They knew the risk for doing the right thing and took it anyway.

In 2019 we had technology that we discovered that is really effective at killing the original and various varients in 1 shot. This is due to a revolutionary technique where the stem of a virus cell is targeted rather than its spike. Covid being a respritory illness also follows a similiar path of infection as the flu does. Both are known for high mutation rates which means likely varients to pop up. Now instead of developing this we went with mrna. Why? Way easier to scale like how its easier to get concrete than carbon nano tubes. This being a cheaper and quick to production product. They went with that.  I'm sure you have noticed the booster campaign in full swing which is causing these companies to explode in sales. They were taught a lesson that just raising the prices was too dangerous for public image \"gentlemen responsible just created a crypto thing as well related to health of course\" and then went to find another way to increase sales without the public being as mad.",

Regardless; adding up all the various columns of vaccinated individuals still gives you lower mortality than for the unvaccinated, by a statisticallly significant margin.\n\nYes; unvaccinated people are less likely to die from other causes; but I think the bias here is that if you\u2019re unvaccinated, Covid is likely to finish you off if you\u2019re already close to death anyways, and that then gets counted as a covid death.",

If the vaccines work well, why would it not be the same distribution but just higher numbers?\n\nWhat I meant here is; for any given age group, that you select, unvaccinated individuals have higher mortality rates.\n\nBy far the most important factor to covid mortality is age. It's a virus that kills those with already waning  immune systems. \n\nFor that reason, Canada, like governments all around the world, prioritized vaccinating older generations. \n\n99% of people above the age of 70 have been vaccinated, 96% for ages above 60 (I'm talking here 1st and second dosis). \n\nWho has *not* been vaccinated? Kids, mostly. Almost none under 4. But again, that's meaningless, because kids also just aren't at mortal risk from covid. In most cases, it can't be seen at all. \n\nSo then taking that into account; 14% of deaths coming from people that aren't vaccinated or only vaccinated once is, strongly indicative of vaccination reducing death rates. Because relative to the demographics, (1% of 70+ year olds, which compromise 85% of deaths, 5.5% of 60-70 yos, who represent 9% of deaths), that makes them heavily overrepresented in the death statistics. How many 25 year olds didn't get fully vaccinated is just irrelevant to measure how well the vaccine protects against covid mortality.",

Overweight people are by far the most overrepresented group, it's the single greatest controllable factor in COVID infection, severity, and death. And not just in COVID, being overweight puts you at much greater risk for hundreds of health problems.   There's no fitness mandate, is there?  Not even fitness incentives.  Is this not about health?  Can't profit from people being fit, quite the opposite.\n\nHaving inadequate levels of vitamin D is also an enormous factor in COVID infection, severity, and mortality.  Again, not just for COVID, but most respiratory infections and a host of other problems.  \n\nWhere are the mandates for an extremely well known, cheap, and safe COVID therapeutic and prophylactic (more so than vaccines, at least) that is also enormously beneficial to overall health?\n\nThat's not really profitable either.\n\nBTW, it seems odd that the demographics affected by covid deaths would be skewed for the unvaccinated.  If the vaccines work well, why would it not be the same distribution but just higher numbers?\n\nWhat was presented by the government of Ontario was that fully vaxxed and boosted were infected at higher rates than unvaccinated and partially vaccinated (they didn't break down those numbers separately).  \n\nWhich makes sense, as those partially vaccinated were likely done recently, and the vaccines offer very brief and waning  protection.\n\nWhich brings up my last point:  if you believe the vaccines are worth it, what's the point of one shot every 9 months?  By all accounts protection is minimal after just 2 months.  \n\nThey're just trying to move as many doses as possible without pissing people off too much.

Back in 2020, Toronto Health publicly admitted via their Official Tweet account that if you had Covid, went to the hosptital and died due to anything, you would still be counted as a Covid death. News Media ignored this. Despite its obvious statitistical repercussions. \n\n\nIt is obvious. The mere fact the CDC/FDA got away with the notion that if you caught Covid or had side effectes in less than 14 days after a shot you would count as \"unvaccinated,\" is a testament of how uneducated the general public is. There is also the denial that people would have negative outcomes due to the shot. If they had been Objective, there wohld have been at least three groups made: unvaccinated, under 14 days, post 14 days, instead of just two. But doing that would have showed obvious safety signals. Europe does thus and this is why numerous countries stopped offering the shot, made it optional or outright stopped offering it to some demographics, like Germany, Denmark, France, the Nordic Countries, etc. \n\nAnyway, I digress, when asked how that was not going to fuck up the data and perception of said data, they never responded. This was done all over North America until January 2022. \n\nWhen all of the sudden, Nuance as of why you presented at a hosptital \"for,\" Covid or not, suddenly mattered.

Therefore, vaccination with mRNA-based vaccines, preferably with the mRNA-1273 vaccine, might not only provide better immunological protection for the mother but also for her breastfed infant. \n\nor this one:\n\n[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2796427](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2796427)\n\n>The sporadic presence and trace quantities of COVID-19 vaccine mRNA detected in EBM suggest that breastfeeding after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination is safe, particularly beyond 48 hours after vaccination. These data demonstrate for the first time to our knowledge the biodistribution of COVID-19 vaccine mRNA to mammary cells and the potential ability of tissue EVs to package the vaccine mRNA that can be transported to distant cells.\n\nNow, it's been known for a long time that antibodies do go from the mother to the infant through nursing. The bigger question is would these specific antibodies survive the GI tract of the infant and the answer seems to be no. Either way, finding covid antibodies is not a negative thing unless you'd prefer mothers to not pass antibodies to their children, which is kind of a big deal. \n\nI am not suggesting genetic suicide and so far the data supports my position.

When this happens:\n\n* Apparently lipid nanoparticles can cross the blood brain barrier.\n\n* They're biologically active. mRNA that gets into a cell acts just like a virus and instructs the cell to produce a single foreign antigen.\n\n* When the cells express these antigens, it triggers **2** separate immune responses. One is the production of antibodies to the antigen. But there is also the CMIR (cell mediated immune response) that kills the cells that are expressing the viral antigens (because of the mRNA vaxx)\n\n* Among other things, CMIR is associated with cell death and inflammation. Hence your myo and pericarditis. \n\n* When the vaxx mRNA gets into the cells of the vascular endothelium... It's pretty reasonable to think that a CMIR (taking place inside veins or arteries) could inlove blood clots as well. \n\ntldr; Problems like these are the reason why it takes 5 to 7 years of testing to determine if a new vaccine is safe to use on people.\n\nps.

It also shouldnt have to be mentioned that polio rates dropped dramatically long before the Salk and cutter vaccine too so you cant claim the polio vaccine is responsible for its eradication. Rates dropped shortly after DDT was phased out. Now its only seen in vaccinated people ironically.\n\nIf you're an open minded researcher that would like to validate my claims, i'm happy share books, studies, docs, etc for why I hold these positions.",

People keeps repeating he would do a military coup to close the congress but we had 2 national holidays (September 7th) that it would be possible and he didn't do it. And the ex-president Lula is trying to become president again (after going out of jail). As he threw tons of commodities money into bankers (in 2008), I think there's a plan for him to win (even altering the votes' results). He think it was easy to rule but at that time commodities was in a HIGH moment (economically speaking, we won a lot by the USA crisis and we exported TONS shit of food).. Last but not least: Lula is the one who wants to control/regulate the media(in our case, the brazilian MSM).

The vaccine that was developed via Warp Speed is NOT the one that\u2019s been administered to the public. \n\nAs far as Trump was concerned, it was more about the vaccine being out and available to those who wanted it. It was never about the actual vaccine though, he just understood that that was the ONLY scenario that would allow the country to reopen and get back to business as opposed to being locked down for years to come while they \u201cdeveloped\u201d a vaccine. \n\nThe real crime came when Trump left and the new admin immediately began to mandate the shots and tons of boosters. These were drastically different from what the Trump admin produced. \n\nNow I assume he knows all of this and that\u2019s why he has not spoken out yet on what\u2019s happening because of he did, he knows they\u2019d immediately pounce and blame him for EVERY single vaccine injury or death which plays right into their hands. \n\nThe pro trump people have largely avoided all of the madness because they understood the game from the start. Everyone has a choice at the end of the day. \n\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2020/09/28/operation-warp-speed-vast-military-involvement/",

I was never anti-vaxx, even got the flu shot back in 2019 and scoffed at antivaxxers.\n\nThe covid anti-vaxx movement is as grass roots as it gets. There are hustlers trying to get a buck out of it, there are bad actors muddying the water and spreading fake information, some politicians tried to piggyback on it, but for the most part it is made up of people who simply refused the official narrative for various reasons. I blame sanity and lack of doublethink skills.\n\nIf you're concerned with conflict of interests you may want to check on Pfizer and Big Pharma stakeholders like dr. Bill Gates funneling money to research universities, doctors, scientists, politicians, FDA, MSM and big tech.",

And this is not just US but I remember a pretty prominent team of scientists in India were first to sound the alarm on COVID being a lab manufactured virus. And unfortunately at the time NIH and many European scientific communities told them to either redact their statement or risk being kicked out of internationally acclaimed scientific community and revocation of any finding granted to them for international projects. And because of the pressure they redacted their statement and 2 years later Dr. Rand Paul pulls up the same questions regarding mutations in the virus for this. Also idk of this is related but I know 2 people who recently got cancer despite living pretty healthy lives. 1 never drank, smoked or even ate meat. Has no history of liver cancer and the other never smoked and lived in a non polluted area (very high standards rich people area btw) and got lung cancer. I think someone also said that the military also said something similar last year of seeing a rise in cancer rates but then deleted that data.

VAERS reports are 85% filed by medical professionals. They are then vetted by the CDC. One Harvard study proved that adverse events in VAERS are under reported to the extent that only 1% of the adverse events actually make it through the VAERS system. The reporting process is onerous - taking anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes to fill out the report. This is an eon to a busy medical professional. Then there's the stigma of filing a report that is clearly unwanted by the establishment and has been known to ruin careers. Medical professionals are loathe to file these reports. \n\nPlease keep your bullshit OUT of the realm of meaningful discussion.",

You cannot plead ignorance here. You (technically) can lie to yourself, but the whole world is not happy with the cowards that cheered this vaccine on instead of standing against it. No wonder they have stopped with vaccines and just implemented zero bail and legalized murder. Well done. Your courage to be keyboard warriors is looking misplaced every day. On days when reports of more dead from symptoms tied to the vaccine it is particularly hard to stomach the arrogance. I don't care what your feeling are. I just want to say what I feel. YOUR willingness to allow YOUR governments (who gleefully watch nations rise and fall) put a foreign substance in YOUR body is fine, but lying and using guilt to force others to make the same mistake that YOU know YOU made is evil. It is good that you do not believe in God, as the rest of your time on the planet you can make balloon animals out of the clear fact that he is judging each and everyone of us currently, and we haven't even left the planet. You might want to refocus your energy. This life is 120 years if you don't take the vaccine. I don't know if I can undo all of the suffering that I have caused others in that short a time, but I try not to knowingly lie and create more suffering in the time that I have left. The secret to life is that you are here for others, not yourself. You are an instrument of God from the moment you agree to be. I can never go back to being a conspiracy theorist, or political enthusiast. You individuals that are willfully lying about the COVID19 protocols and vaccines are part of an impediment to other people moving on from this event. Perhaps, everyone can admit it was a huge boondoggle to bring about the end of time. Forgive YOURSELF for falling for it, and forgive them for choosing this route and move forward to fix it. Obviously, nothing will be fix3d because bots and shills are telling you that THIS FLU, WHICH WAS ADMITTEDLY CREATED IN A LABORATORY (WHICH CANNOT BE PROVEN TO EXIST OUTSIDE OF A LABORATORY SETTING, SAVE INEXPLICABLE SYMPTOMS) WAS SO BAD THAT THE WORLD PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES STOPPED ALL WORK TO CREATE A VACCINE (MOST LIKELY IN THE SAME LABORATORY THEY CREATED THE VIRUS) AND COMPLETED IT IN RECORD TIME. THE VACCINE WAS BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY MOST GOVERNMENTS. SO, 90% OF THE PEOPLE ON REDDIT HAVE AN OPINION ON IT. SO, WHY ARE YOU ALL AFRAID OF A FEW ONLINE BULLIES WHO TELL YOU THAT WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS A LIE (ON A CONSPIRACY FORUM)? RUN THE LIARS, BOTS AND SHILLS OUT.",

Several times.\n\nYou remember that I predicted this was the article you'd give me.\n\nHere is the portion you are alarmed about:\n\n>The drugs it is pushing along now, by contrast, are more modest, relying on single administrations of mRNA. Beyond the four vaccines, it has one early-stage clinical trial targeting cardiac disease, launched just last month by partner AstraZeneca. The treatment involves a one-time dose and doesn\u2019t use the tricky nanoparticle casing.\n\n...I don't seem to see any signs in this article that suggest the vaccines are failing. The article's doom and gloom is solely out about how the Crigler-Najjar treatment had disappeared from the public eye, as it had problems with its delivery system at scale.\n\n>Anyway the problems all come from the fact that the mRNA can end up expressed anywhere in the body, it doesn't matter if it's for a vaccine or for gene therapy.\n\nNo, the problem for the treatment is that when mRNA leaks out of the capsules, you get a very severe inflammatory immune response, because there is not supposed to be mRNA outside of cells. So, when we had to infuse a monkey with a whole bag of the stuff to treat a liver enzyme disorder, *a lot* of mRNA leaked out. It isn't really a problem with the 1ml shot; but they had other solutions ready for testing which worked out.\n\nIt has nothing to do with *where* it was expressed. The reason they targeted a liver enzyme is because the liver will very readily take up the majority of the dose. Otherwise, the enzyme they re-introduced was harmless, and the mRNA itself seems to work fine enough.\n\nI know that's hard to hear, but remember: I predicted the article you were going to post.

Oh, wait, you want me to look at 'All Cause Mortality?' Well, uh, sure, it's true that every one of the trial participants died from poisoning soon after they took the pill, but that's irrelevant to my study. My trial's ***ENDPOINT*** that I was interested in looking at and publishing was '***Did anyone die from cancer***?' Since the answer was no, I concluded that the trial was 100% successful. Now I'm lobbying congress to mandate that everyone in the world take my pill or lose their job because, after all, cancer is a scourge on humanity, is it not?\"",

We really don\u2019t know that (about the Sputnik vaccine),\u201d said Kathryn Edwards, a professor of paediatrics and vaccine expert in the infectious diseases division at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in the United States.\n\nShe said that the risk of what a vaccine might do to a virus - in terms of fighting it, blocking it, or forcing it to adapt - is \u201calways a concern\u201d.\n\nDan Barouch, a specialist at Harvard\u2019s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, noted that mutation rates for coronaviruses are far lower than for viruses like HIV, but added: \u201cThere are many potential downsides of using a vaccine that doesn\u2019t work. The risk that it (the virus) would mutate is a theoretical risk.\u201d\n\nScientists say similar evolutionary pressure to mutate is seen with bacterial pathogens, which - when faced with antibiotics designed to target them - can evolve and adapt to evade the drugs and develop resistance.\n\nAntibiotic resistance and the rise of superbugs, is described by the World Health Organization as one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development today.\n\nJones stressed that vaccine-induced viral mutations are \u201ca rare outcome\u201d, and the greater the efficacy of the vaccine in blocking a virus\u2019 ability to enter cells and replicate there, the lower the risk of it having an opportunity to circulate and \u201clearn\u201d how to evade antibody defences.\n\n\u201cIf (a vaccine) is completely sterilizing, the virus can\u2019t get in, so it can\u2019t learn anything because it never gets a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it gets in and replicates ... there is selection pressure for it to evade whatever antibodies have been generated by the inefficient vaccine. And you don\u2019t know what the outcome of that will be.\u201d\n\n\nBonus Nature.com article from March 2021.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00728-2\n\nHigher rates of immunity can create selective pressure, which would favour variants that are able to infect people who have been immunized.\n\nVaccines will almost inevitably create new evolutionary pressures that produce variants.",

Yes, when the vast majority of the population takes a vaccine, there will be many people that have medical issues after it.

Drugs do NOT always act in the way \"Science\" (read: big pharma) predicted based on theory, this is why long term studies are *required* for full FDA approval and why the FDA would not approve this \"vaccine\" for anything but emergency use. \n\nPlease go Google \"Thalidomide.\" I'll wait. \n\nMy body is not owned by the government of the United  States of America, or by \"Science\" (read: big pharma). No one, and when I say no one I absolutely mean NO ONE, has the right to tell me I have to put ANY DAMN THING into it... Especially not an *experimental drug* that has had no long term testing, does not have full FDA approval, and *isn't even effective at what it was created for* - not as a legal mandate, and not with the threat of job loss, homelessness, and starvation. *No one.* Fucking full stop. \n\n\"Science\" can go find its fucking money elsewhere. I was not born to fund \"scientific research\" by risking my health, my safety, my peace of mind, or my DNA for future generations. \n\nFuck \"Science\" (read: big pharma).

And are still being forced to be given the original, ignoring all recent data while dismissing all religious accommodations even though chaplains have signed off and approved religious exemption to be valid by lengthy interview processes.

Someone sick and unvaccinated with a fever, tired, sneezing and coughing or someone sick but vaccinated with a mild runny nose and symptoms comparable to allergies?\n\nMe, when I got covid, it was mild but I am responsible, I got tested, so I knew it. Once I knew it, I stayed indoors and did not transit the disease to anyone. Had my symptoms been even more mild than they were -- I might not have even known or checked, I could have gotten people sick at that point.\n\nSo the idea it keeps people from transmitting the virus -- in my specific case it would not have and could only have made me more likely to infect others.\n\nIMO, in any event, the onus on people is themselves. If I was sickly, obese, elderly and at risk, it's not young people's responsibility to ruin their lives, stay indoors, take poorly tested mRNA vaccines they don't need and such.\n\nYou seem to think young people, who we have established really do not need the protection of the vaccine, should get vaccinated to protect old people. I disagree now as I did 3 years ago, you act like your position is inarguable somehow, but it's built on a weak foundation.\n\nIt doesn't necessarily protect older people by keeping young people from spreading it and young people do not need the vaccine's protection.",

Viral load? \nBlood brain barrier? \nWTF are you talking about \ud83d\ude33 \nExplained: Without the S protein, viruses like the novel SARS-CoV-2 would not be able to interact with the cells of potential hosts\u2026 As a result, the S protein represents an ideal target for vaccine\u2026 its role is penetrating cells, the S protein of viruses, particularly the SARS-CoV-2. \nViral load: the amount of virus doctors can find in your body. They might use blood, nasal swabs, or other bodily fluids to test the load for a particular virus.\nPeople infected with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 may have different viral loads. This goes for people who aren\u2019t unvaccinated, as well as \u201cbreakthrough infections\u201d that affect those who are.\n\n[https://www.webmd.com/lung/covid-viral-load](https://www.webmd.com/lung/covid-viral-load)\n[https://www.news-medical.net/amp/health/What-are-Spike-Proteins.aspx](https://www.news-medical.net/amp/health/What-are-Spike-Proteins.aspx)\n\n \nI\u2019ll be downvoted because YOU don\u2019t understand MRNA? Ok. Keep up with your ignorance and misinformation or take time to read the medical papers. No need to live in fear \ud83d\ude09\n\nIf you ever want to know what\u2019s really killing people, like the actual causes of myocardial diseases it might surprise you\u2026 especially because they aren\u2019t overweight or old, or vaccinated in all cases. \n\nThere should also be less sceptics about long-term effects. The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) estimates that the spike proteins that were generated by COVID-19 vaccines last up to a few weeks, like other proteins made by the body. \nThe immune system quickly identifies, attacks and destroys the spike proteins because it recognizes them as \u201cnot part of you\u201d. The reason boosters are required is due to the fact that mRNA leaves your body at such a quick rate.",

Maybe during the first couple strains it was reduced slightly, but omicron put an end to that and it hasn\u2019t gained any ground since then; the viral loads are the same. \n\nSo again, it\u2019s potentially far more dangerous than simply getting covid and recovering. On top of that, this was nearly exclusively an elderly and morbidity obese virus. So what benefit does a child have in boosters? \n\nAnd straight up.. you\u2019re either disingenuous or fucking stupid. They did say 100% safe and effective\u2026 Joe Biden was saying it less than a year ago. \n\nAre you going to lie again and say they never said that the vaccine stays in your arm and is gone after a few days???

It was a huge distraction meant to divide people and almost everyone fell for it on both sides of the issue.  \n\nAnd of course just like the \u201cdied with Covid\u201d nonsense during Covid, alt media devotees are going to have their hold my beer moment and claim an entire host of health problems/deaths are vaccine related. \n\nIt is just so embarrassingly typical of alt media and many conspiracy communities to take the exaggerating, twisting of the truth, lies, divisiveness etc that the msm pulls and repackage to cater towards their audience. \n\nHealth in 1st world countries like the US was already horrendous.  Heart disease and similar illnesses were already extremely prevalent even with seemingly young and healthy people.  I knew several people in the 2000s and 2010s who seemed healthy and dropped dead of heart disease.  And of course people brainwashed by the alt media would have claimed without a doubt that these were vaccine related if they happened recently. Health conditions in the US have been spiraling downward for decades and will continue to and the vaccine has little to nothing to do with it.  You can believe whatever you want but I will stay skeptical of all media.  They all have an agenda.  \n\nThe natural medicine industry is really interesting to look into. They are doubling down in not only convincing people to forsake mainstream medicine, they want you to think it is killing everyone so they can grow even bigger.  The same people who convinced my uncle to not get the vaccine, which it didn\u2019t matter if he did or not, also tried to sell him an expensive Chinese herb when he was dying of Covid.  The alt medicine industry is worth around $90 billion and is expected to more than quadruple to over $400 billion by 2030.  There is big money behind alternative media sources that most don\u2019t even know about. These people are behind most of the vaccine fear mongering on social media. They stand to profit the most by turning people away from mainstream medicine and doctors.  They are making so much money off of homeopathic remedies and other snake oil.  \nJust like big pharma is not your friend, neither are these people.  \nThey apply the same tactics and usually have even less credibility.  They aren\u2019t afraid to harm people, lie to them, or take advantage of them for profit.",

The vax has been out there a long time. It's not like they can't find access or didn't get around to it. The number have been fairly constant at this point so it's not having to wait 6 weeks or so before the one dose people are eligible for the next dose.\n\nIt seems logical that they had a reaction bad enough to make them not want to continue onto the second dose. Some may have even been serious enough to require hospitalization, some may have died. Anyway, I'll leave you to ponder it.\n\nhttps://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/",

Essentially, due to the fact that COVID caused an enormous amount of excess deaths, some people who may not directly be labeled to COVID influenced death may have an altercation in which their death is wrongly attributed. However, the amount of people who actually died of COVID but were labeled as something OTHER than COVID on their death certificate is far greater than those who died from things other than COVID. \n\nI may have phrased it poorly, but unfortunately this kind of mistranslation of data and not understanding how statistics can sometimes be incorrectly calculated when on such a grandiose scale is how we\u2019ve gone made people believe the vaccine is some farce. \n\nThe fact that COVIDs mortality rate is lower than some other diseases (during the pinnacle time of social media echo chambers) is essentially the main reasons we\u2019re having this debate. People can\u2019t wrap their heads around how something could happen in a time like today with our medical advancements. It is merely a lack of anticipation on the governments parts for improperly preparing for a pandemic. \n\nShit like this has happened in the past and if this were an outbreak of polio or influenza (something with higher mortality rates) people would be clamoring at the doors for a vaccine no matter how rushed it is.

States should delay further reopening until mask mandates are fully implemented, and enforcement by local businesses will be critical for preventing potential future closures.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2?fbclid=IwAR0Q3-WhHv1F9dmZSr2iLNQ-F6ioAIfOYAch7PPtHib9EsuVyhs-mYZlXcg\n\n>We detected coronavirus in respiratory droplets and aerosols in 3 of 10 (30%) and 4 of 10 (40%) of the samples collected without face masks, respectively, but did not detect any virus in respiratory droplets or aerosols collected from participants wearing face masks,\n\n\nhttps://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf\n\n>The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts.

Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020.

The amount of deaths is vanishingly small, virtually zero. Any professional will tell you this. If you're going to take VAERS at face value and declare it proof the vaccines are deadly, you'll never see a successful vaccine for the rest of your life. The next pandemic will show the exact same sort of numbers, guaranteed. Why? Because Vaers isn't showing vaccine injuries, just things that happened after the vaccine was taken.

He's always interviewing people who are in deep with the medical details and has been spending time with trying to undo the damages wrought by the shots. (He'll email you to death but just take the info you need and ignore the rest.) Once you get into 'the clique' and knowing you're not alone... it's wonderful. Mike Adams, the Brighteon platform (TV, radio, podcasts/vids, social). These are all the folks at the cutting edge of this. \n\nSadly, if he'd had exposure to this kind of intel... he would've known better.

If everyone is soooo convinced she is still kicking around somewhere why not a simple bit of proof.  Why go on national tv and then hide from the public and never make a comment again. Why purposely try to confuse the public.  Why let the anti covax people have that ammo if it is easily refuted.   Why have another person pretend to be you.  Why is it no one has seen her anywhere.   Why did her husband change his fb to single.  Why was there a death notice listed for her.  I mean the more you dig the more obvious it is this girl is sadly deader than a doorknob.  I don't want her to be dead, I wish no one had been tricked into taking that poison.  Why so many people online talking about her being alive with zero proof.. WHy do you believe she is alive?  Can you provide proof that isn't an msm article saying she is alive and well.  Nope because she isn't.  I wish she was I really do.  It would be so simple for her to stop all the online talk about her.  So freaking simple.  If you wanted to hide from the public it would be sooo much easier to pop out say howdy and go on with your life.  People would forget all about her if she was proven without a shadow of a doubt to be alive and herself.  She would not be mentioned her anymore.  You wouldn't have to shiell about her being alive anymore.  You see how easy that would be and how much more beneficial that would be for her if she doesn't want contact or people talking about her. \" HI all, Its me Tiff.   I am not dead.... Look at me without my mask on todays date of....  Sorry I was away so long I am scared of the spotlight after volunteering to be in it on national tv.  Now that I am alive you can quit talking about me\"  That is all it would take.  We have seen photos of her.  No one will question if it is really her if it is.  No subterfuge no hiding her face.  Tiffany Dover.  Wouldn't take 15 second and she is out of the spotlight for good.  Nope she supposedly is in hiding from the scary people in the world and the press after VOLUNTEERING TO TAKE IT ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.  LOL   gmafb",

She is dead, has been dead since she took that poison and it killed her.  Plain and simple.  Until she comes out and does something like I mentioned people will continue to believe that she is dead.

And your father has low probabilities chances all the time. High likelihood something would happen. \n\n\nFor example, every year, 800,000 people have a stroke. That is 2,500 strokes per day. Last year, 70% of the population had boosters and doses, so 3 total days of coincidental times. With a flat distribution,  that means just by chance, about 5,000 people had strokes within a day of the shot. Same for heart attacks. That is also 800,000/year.\n\nSo that means, just by chance, 10,000 people had either a stroke or heart attack within 1 day of getting a vaccine dose, even if the vaccine dose was just a placebo.\n\n1 degree of separation with immediate family, that means about 100,000 people last year had a close family member that had a heart attack or stroke within 1 day of the vaccine.\n\nAdd +100,000 for every extra day you count since the vaccine.

Well the commirnaty vaccine was never made available, they just kept distributing the same formula that was EAU approved, so that people too naive to research were thinking they were getting an FDA approved product.

He was the builder who built Babel which later became Babylon. All false religion springs from that \"great city,\" hence the prostitute is known as \"the great city\" (Rev. 17:18). Ancient religions took drugs to communicate with the spirits as a part of their religious rites. Thus, pharmakeia (pharmaceuticals) is connected to spiritism.\n\nYou want to know the true identity of Babylon the Great and how she does indeed control much big business, religion, politics, science, entertainment, banking, education, the military and more? Her identity is a \"mystery\" to most people. (Rev. 17:5).

I've been retired since 2017 & now I sale Credit Card processing for small business'. \n\nI had been working for Portland Fire & Rescue for  about 3 years  when 9/11 happened.\n\n Immediately after, like the next Monday, I showed up at a Military Recruiters office to join the Marine Corps. I didn't care about the 50% pay cut. I didn't care about having to leave my great job for probably years at a time to live in a shit hole... About  6 weeks  before I was supposed to ship out, I fell off a ladder, & broke my back. (I Had to have a lower Lumbar Fusion at 28 years old.) I could no longer go to Basic. They wanted me to heal for 2 years, then go take a new physical. I never went. Looking back, that is probably the best thing that could have happened to me. At that time, I was so Gung Ho about quitting the Fire Dept if need be, (for years at a time), & becoming a Marine. I wanted to deploy, I wanted revenge for all of the Americans that had died that day. I was willing to die for America... \n\nAnyways, I had always trusted the Govt. I believed in the Iraq & Afghanistan War. I was a Patriot through & through... Then, about 5 or 6 years later in 2011, the Department hired a young lady who I became great friends with. She was young, in her early  20's & had been raised with the internet. The younger recruits in the fire service questioned everything, still respected authority, but wouldn't just go with the flow, things had to make sense. Orders had to make sense. I thought it was great for the Dept! She took me down a rabbit hole that I have still 12 years later, never pulled myself out of.\nShe showed me all this 9/11 evidence, that I believe proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that our Government (the one I so faithfully served & wanted to fight for)  planned & executed 9/11. \nShe showed me building 7, which I had never even heard of before I met her... \nI have been awake ever since. \n\nI was never a conspiracy guy, but since meeting this person, I don't believe shit the Government says. I pretty much assume Thwy are trying to control my every action & herd me & my family into some controllable box (a metaphorical box, not litteral) they want us to exist in. \n\nThe Government does whatever is nessecarry to appease the Ultra wealthy ppl that get them elected into their positions of power, & once they are there, Thwy do everything they possibly can to hold onto that power. \n\nCovid is 100% made in a lab. & Covid is just a trial run.\n\nEducate yourself on the atrocities of the Clinton's, Bush's, Obama's, Trump's, & especially Biden's...\n\nThey are ALL crooked & they are all controlled by higher evil powers. \n\nIt's not that bad being a crazy conspiracy person. \nI'm not taliki G about Bigfoot or Bases on Mars. \n\nI'm talking about an under wealthy  secret Cabal that wants to reduce the world population to below 1 billion people. They are paying the long game & Thwy are winning. \n\nAnyways, thanks for waking up! It's nice to have you with us!",

I can\u2019t get shit done anymore. I had weird chest pain for awhile after my second dose. I barely bleed on my period now too. \n\nSure these are minor but they\u2019re things that only began once I got the first shot and got worse after the second. I\u2019m HORRIFIED to get the booster. Especially knowing how incredibly painful the first two were. I had body aches and fever so bad with the second one that if I could have gotten up to kms, I would have. I have never felt agony like that before. I\u2019m so scared to get a booster\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m sorry about your father. Thats scary and horribly invalidating of everyone to act like the vaccine isn\u2019t related when it very well could be and probably is. I don\u2019t know why so many healthcare professionals pretend it has no downsides. Nothing is completely safe for everyone. Sending you love OP",

I apologize for any typos.\n\nAround November of 2020, my mom, brother, and me ended up catching Covid. My dad did catch it but it was very mild case. He was literally able to brush it off as a slight headache. It was kinda insane just because he technically was still recovering from health issues from the year before. \n\nFast forward to around Feb 2021, my dad got the vaccine without mentioning it to anyone. Caused a lot of drama with my mom who was/is very adamant against it. In a way, I know he got it to spite her but that\u2019s a whole other story\u2026\n\nAround March-April (sorry timeline is fuzzy) he ends up having a fainting spell which ends up sending him to the hospital. His heartbeat had become irregular and basically he had a mild stroke. He ends up getting a heart stent and then a stricter regiment of medications. Plus physical therapy.\n\nHe recovered for the most part. But his mind didn\u2019t.\n\nAfter that he just started making poor health decisions (not taking his meds for one) but after getting his booster, he regressed to an almost dementia like state.  Plus ended up having to have his heartbeat shocked as well as another stent. \n\nMost days he sits in a recliner in front of our front entryway. His limbs are completely filled with fluid because of retention. He has slurred speech patterns and can\u2019t remember a lot, including my name. He can\u2019t really do anything on his own and he refuses to take essential medications. Picks on my mom who is has become his caretaker essentially. \n\nLiterally dying. On borrowed time :/\n\nIt\u2019s insane because i\u2019m not saying it was purely the vaccines fault but my dad has, begrudgingly to me, has always seemed to have nine lives.  The man has recovered from some intense stuff.  I would never think that him getting the vaccine would land him in his current state, but that\u2019s what it seems like. One thing about him, prior to the stroke, he was always good about seeing a doctor and taking medications. He took them religiously actually. Which is why I assume he was in good health for a 70 y/o.\n\nSeeing him get like this, especially after getting the booster, it has made me really question what was in them. I\u2019m not against vaccines because i understand the science but i\u2019m scared of how greed corrupts the innocence behind that. I\u2019ve heard many cases of people having strokes/clotting.

Both my parents were fine from the boosters, thank God, but I'm so glad they aren't getting any more of them. I'm really glad they have the sense not to get any more of the shots after seeing the minor thing that happened to me. \n\nIt's devastating that big pharma and the world governments pushed these untested shots on so many people and killed many of them in the process. I'm very sorry your dad and your whole family has suffered so much because of that. I believe the whole \"Multiple shot\" approach was fucked from the start and I don't give a shit what any scientist, DoCtOr, or news puppet says. From what I saw, a lot of people got off lucky with the first 2 shots and the boosters are where things started getting really crazy. I stopped following it because no one in my family plans to get any more boosters, but I'm honestly terrified to see what happens once people start lining up for 4th, 5th, etc. I feel really stupid for taking the shot to begin with but I consider myself lucky for only getting the Dermatographia.",

He was bringing in about 20k a month, had a beautiful home, and a decent life overall. That all changed once he got his booster in December.\n\nHe went for his booster shot on 12/23 at 10AM. I arrived at his house at around 8PM to find him on the floor, unresponsive, covered in a pool of urine.\n\nCalled 911, brought him into the hospital. Told every doctor and nurse that he had gotten his booster about 8-10 hours ago, they all looked at me as if I was insane.\n\nTurns out my dad had a stroke. What are the odds my healthy father coincidentally has a stroke 8 hours after receiving his booster? Pretty damn slim. \n\nSince then, he\u2019s been a wreck. He hasn\u2019t been able to work, his cognitive state is decaying, his memory is awful, he has no motivation to do anything. He used to be a healthy active man, since the stroke he stopped cooking for himself, stopped exercising, eats like shit, and hasn\u2019t been able to return to his job. He\u2019s now back in the hospital for a blood clot in his leg and narrowly missed amputation. He is going to have no choice but to sell his home as he cannot continue to afford it with no income.\n\nThank you big pharma for ruining my fathers life! And taking away from mine. But of course, whenever I mentioned it to any healthcare professional, I would get shrugged off as if I\u2019m some conspiracy theorist moron. Fuck Pfizer, fuck Moderna, and fuck all the corrupt assholes who are getting rich and living with no stress while the middle class citizens suffer. Fuck you!!!!\n\nTLDR: fuck the CDC/WHO for shoving this rushed vaccine down our throat and banning other alternatives like ivermectin. All about the Benjamin I guess"

If you read more about the doctor in the Atlantic article, he sees that there is a temporal correlation between the vaccine and his cancer spread but doesn't conclude that the vaccine caused cancer from that alone. There was also an actual medical basis for how the vaccine caused this particular cancer. \n\nSo you can say cancer rates are going up, but that could just be due to the fact that regular cancer screenings and diagnostics came to a near stand still for a long time during Covid. Now we have a bunch of people who developed cancer during that time for unrelated reasons all getting diagnosed at once as things open up. That makes it seem like cancer rates are spiking when they aren't. \n\nSo my question is, if these vaccines are actually causing all these different cancers, how are they doing it? What is the medical basis for this theory?",

Makes sense https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/09/with-deadlocked-vote-on-dark-money-disclose-act-fails-to-clear-senate/\nSeems like you haven't done ur research into this issue. It would then give corporations pressure to only fund certain people because the Democrats could use their influence in the media and big tech to affect sales of companies funding certain people the Democrats don't like. But go on....keep making this a party issue. Be a good little pawn. I've already said the Republicans have the same corruption in their party like the Democrats. U just don't want to admit the party u support has extreme issues as well. Like Nancy Pelosis insider trading. But you don't want to talk about that do you?",

Lmao I'm sure u spent a few hours trying to find that. I have already shown u research u just don't believe anything that goes against ur own viewpoint. I showed u an article saying ur wrong about Republicans who voted against that because that means the Democrats would have free reign to attack their donors politically thru the courts and media and more. Anonymity can be a good thing sometimes and I understand how u were twisted into believing there lies. I don't think the question to solve that issue is as easy as it seems. We have already seen Democrats persecuting people like Mike Lindell with the FBI. It would be more political persecution if they had the names of donors. And some people want it to be private anyways. It's ok for someone to be private about there political beliefs.",

I've been notoriously distrustful of our government for years. Have seen the issues in both sides of the party. I actually don't vote because our system is so corrupt there hasn't been a candidate since I've been able to vote that is even worth going down and casting my vote. I was a fan of Bernie I would've voted for him over Trump. Now I would vote for DeSantis but not Trump. It used to be the Democrats were the ones distrustful of the pharmaceutical companies the government and corporations and now they all act like the government and corporations are there friends now. Seems like they just are mindless sheep following whatever agenda makes them get in power the easiest. If Republicans are apart of something they just bitch about whatever they are doing. But when THEY get in power everything they do isn't questioned. Bunch of hypocrites.When did being against the government and large corporations make you a Republican now?",

Again if you have to wait for the media or government to tell you to put ur right shoe on the right foot ur already lost and helpless. You really think they are going to actually be truthful and report and look into all these deaths? As long as they can get away with it they don't have to do anything. They can just claim heart attacks happen all the time and there is no correlation like u said. But the stories are all the same. No health issues. No problems at all. And then just randomly a young person dies within days of taking it. And then some people die months later. Which is much harder to prove if the shot killed them.

These are lifted from a website because its been a few years since I went down that rabbit hole and I just don't remember them word for word. \n\nGenesis chapter 1 says the first man and woman were made at the same   \ntime, and after the animals. But Genesis chapter 2 gives a different   \norder of creation: man, then the animals, and then woman.\n\nGenesis chapter 1 lists six days of creation, whereas chapter 2 refers   \nto the \u201cday that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.\u201d Genesis   \n1:2-3 claims that God created light and divided it from darkness on the   \nfirst day; but Genesis 1:14-19 tells us the sun, moon, and stars weren\u2019t  \n made until the fourth day.\n\nContradictions are also seen in the biblical story of a worldwide flood.  \n According to Genesis 6:19-22, God ordered Noah to bring \u201cof every   \nliving thing of all flesh, two of every sort . . . into the ark.\u201d   \nNevertheless, Genesis 7:2-3 relates that the Lord ordered Noah to take   \ninto the ark the clean beasts and the birds by sevens, and only the   \nunclean beasts by twos.\n\nGenesis 8:4 reports that, as the waters of the flood receded, Noah\u2019s ark  \n rested on the mountains of Ararat in the seventh month. The very next   \nverse, however, says the mountaintops could not be seen until the tenth   \nmonth.\n\nGenesis 8:13 describes the earth as being dry on the first day of the   \nfirst month. But Genesis 8:14 informs us the earth was not dry until the  \n twenty-seventh day of the second month.\n\nThe Old Testament contains an interesting contradiction in the story of   \nthe census taken by King David and the resulting punishment of the   \nIsraelites. God was so angered by the census that he sent a plague that   \nkilled 70,000 men. According to II Samuel 24:1, the Lord had caused   \nDavid to take the census \u2013 which makes the punishment appear even more   \nnonsensical. But an attempt was later made, at I Chronicles 21:1, to   \nimprove God\u2019s image by claiming that Satan incited the census.\n\nFurther, the Old Testament is contradictory as to whether the Lord   \ncommanded the Israelites to sacrifice animals to him. At Jeremiah 7:22,   \nGod denies he ever gave the Israelites commandments about animal   \nsacrifices. In contrast, Exodus 29:38-42 and many other verses depict   \nGod as requiring the Israelites to offer animal sacrifices.\n\nIn the New Testament, there are contradictions between the genealogies   \nof Jesus given in the first chapter of Matthew and the third chapter of   \nLuke.\n\nBoth genealogies begin with Jesus\u2019 father, who is identified as Joseph   \n(which is curious, given that Mary was supposedly impregnated by the   \nHoly Ghost). But Matthew says Joseph\u2019s father was Jacob, while Luke   \nclaims he was Heli. Matthew lists 26 generations between Jesus and King   \nDavid, whereas Luke records 41. Matthew runs Jesus\u2019 line of descent   \nthrough David\u2019s son Solomon, while Luke has it going through David\u2019s son  \n Nathan.\n\nThe story of Jesus\u2019 birth is also contradictory. Matthew 2:13-15 depicts  \n Joseph and Mary as fleeing to Egypt with the baby Jesus immediately   \nafter the wise men from the east had brought gifts.\n\nBut Luke 2:22-40 claims that after the birth of Jesus, his parents   \nremained in Bethlehem for the time of Mary\u2019s purification (which was 40   \ndays, under the Mosaic law). Afterwards, they brought Jesus to Jerusalem  \n \u201cto present him to the Lord,\u201d and then returned to their home in   \nNazareth. Luke mentions no journey into Egypt or visit by wise men from   \nthe east.\n\nConcerning the death of Judas, the disloyal disciple, Matthew 27:5   \nstates he took the money he had received for betraying Jesus, threw it   \ndown in the temple, and \u201cwent and hanged himself.\u201d To the contrary, Acts  \n 1:18 claims Judas used the money to purchase a field and \u201cfalling   \nheadlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.\u201d\n\nIn describing Jesus being led to his execution, John 19:17 recounts that  \n he carried his own cross. But Mark 15:21-23 disagrees by saying a man   \ncalled Simon carried the cross.\n\nRegarding the last words of Jesus while on the cross, Matthew 27:46 and   \nMark 15:34 quote Jesus as crying with a loud voice, \u201cMy God, my God, why  \n hast thou forsaken me?\u201d Luke 23:46 gives his final words as, \u201cFather,   \ninto thy hands I commend my spirit.\u201d John 19:30 alleges the last words   \nwere, \u201cIt is finished.\u201d\n\nThere are even contradictions in the accounts of the resurrection \u2013 the   \nsupposed event that is the very foundation of the Christian religion.   \nMark 16:2 states that on the day of the resurrection, certain women   \narrived at the tomb at the rising of the sun. But John 20:1 informs us   \nthey arrived when it was yet dark. Luke 24:2 describes the tomb as open   \nwhen the women arrived, whereas Matthew 28:1-2 indicates it was closed.   \nMark 16:5 declares that the women saw a young man at the tomb, Luke 24:4  \n says they saw two men, Matthew 28:2 reports they saw an angel, and John  \n 20:11-12 claims they saw two angels.\n\nThe Bible has verses mentioning dragons (Jeremiah 51:34), unicorns   \n(Isaiah 34:7), and cockatrices (Isaiah 11:8). These passages led many   \nnaturalists in the Middle Ages to think such mythical creatures actually  \n exist.\\[46\\]\n\nFinally, it\u2019s inconsistent with science \u2013 and   \nludicrous \u2013 to believe that God confounded the language of humans   \nbecause he was afraid they would build a tower high enough to reach   \nheaven (Genesis 11:1-9).",

You're right, that was an assholeish thing to say, I have no excuses, but pretending that getting the Covid shot was a free and open choice for anyone is a very disingenuous and  harmful attempt to rewrite history.\n\nAt least where I live, there were enormous social, psychological, political and economic pressures coming in from all directions in an effort to force people to submit to the experimental medical procedure (drugs and vaccines are considered experimental for at least 6 years after the first human trials).\n\nHell, every digital street sign on every highway was retasked to perpetually brodcast messages like \"Stay safe, get vaccinated\" or \"protect your loved ones, get the covid vaccine\". And that's not even the tip of the iceberg, taking away peoples' livelihood en mass, lest they submit to experimental medicine, is tantamount violent coercion; and it is in fact far worse than beating people, or public whippings.\n\nEvery public employee in my country was forced to submit to the shot or lose their job, no medical or religious exemptions. That's a million people in a country of 36million, to say nothing of the private sector.\n\nWant to go to school, sorry you need the covid shot, want to keep your kids from freezing and starving, sorry you need the covid shot, want to have a relationship with your extended family, you know the rest.\n\nSubmitting to the covid shot was about as free a choice as someone putting a gun to your head, and asking you to make the free choice between money and your life.",

You're more likely to be young and die of a heart attack than to choke to death at any age (1.5 per 100,000 population).\n\nSharing these odds serves only to give perspective: that young people die of cardiac events at a higher rate than might be expected. I used the royal flush (literally any good poker hand has the same odds of being drawn as any other combination of cards being drawn) because more people probably have witnessed a good poker hand without knowing a young person who has died from a heart attack despite the latter being much more common in actuality. \n\nYour question then becomes paramount because it is the only way to draw a reasonable conclusion about how these vaccines have affected the incidence of cardiac events in young people.",
