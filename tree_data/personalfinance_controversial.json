Assuming you save \\~$3,000/month, and retire at 67 a very rough calculation shows you will have \\~$8Mn in the bank - at 4% safe withdrawal rate that's a $320,000/year income.  While initially, that might sound great... what it's actually saying is that you're over saving with your stated goals!    That said, find out what you \\*do\\* need to save for a comfortable retirement and make sure you always save that, even if some other goals change.\n\nAdditional goals may include a house, travel (like you state, traveling the world) - may I recommend Australia and NZ as excellent destinations), hobbies, retiring early (look at r/leanfire but do realize it is an extreme perspective and may not suit all in the long run).  Of course, a wife/kids will increase costs somewhat, but with your income that should be manageable as long as you keep an eye on finances (at that point come back to consider your wife's retirement options, 529 plans for college, life/disability insurance etc).\n\nThat said, take it slow and easy - there's nothing wrong with saving heavily while you focus on work, just understand you have the potential to do more when you find the inclination.\n\nA few thoughts regarding your original questions:\n\n1. Your long term savings should be in a well-diversified, low fee index funds.  Do keep in mind though these are \\*long term\\* as short term fluctuations can take years to recover.  Something like deposit for a future house may be better suited high yield savings, or some low-risk funds (bonds?).\n2. I like Roth for the following reasons:\n   1. Tax rates are historically low.\n   2. As a high earner at a young age, you are likely to earn more over time and therefore face high taxes in future.\n   3. As you earn/save more, you will likely acquire taxable incomes (e.g. investments, traditional 401k etc), this will complement the Roth earnings well.\n   4. You can retrieve Roth contributions penalty and tax-free.  For me, this is great as I may emigrate from the US one day and don't want to end up double taxed on retirement savings.    Of course, I'll only know the specifics at the time.\n   5. But it doesn't matter. Savings in retirement accounts is the key.  Traditional vs Roth is just details - do whatever suits you.",

Keep doing this and you (and your kids) will come out wealthy later on and they might need a place to live. Plus the last few years have been the best time in US HISTORY to lock in a mortgage / borrow money.\n\nRead Warren Buffets letters (BRK annual report) for insight into how he views investments.  It's a great read and will point you towards low cost index funds.  If you want to invest in individual stocks, set aside a small \"play money\" account that you can stand losing everything and go to town.

I have heard about the benefits of BofA Platinum and Platinum Honors so I am wondering whether it makes sense to keep my money in Merrill Edge and input money into Merrill monthly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4/ Whichever vehicle I use to invest the Christmas Bonus, should i be focused on Index Funds/ETFs at my age or go for individual stocks?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is my first Reddit post so I appreciate the help.",

It's not weighted by market cap, and I don't even think it included some of the companies with the most significant growth in the 1930s. Looking at the DJIA also ignores the role of dividends in stock market returns, and dividends played a much larger role in market growth back then than they did now.\n\nIf there is another example of the US stock market taking 30 years to recover from a crash, I genuinely would like to hear about it.\n\nI'm not saying it *can't* happen. I think people should globally diversify their portfolios, and they should de-risk into bonds as they deplete their \"human capital\".

And those different companies interact with each other, which can compound the overall improvements over time.  \n\nObviously all kinds of macro-economic and market factors apply short-term adjustments up or down on that overall trend. Those factors can make it practically impossible to predict what the market is going to do tomorrow, or when things will peak or bottom out.  But the wider net of companies you can pull into your portfolio, the more likely things smooth out to that trend.  With the catch that things settle out if you can wait \"long enough\", and \"enough\" could be a long time (like your Nikkei example).\n\nOr we have a global natural / political / financial / existential catastrophe and it becomes a moot point.",

However, current environment we are in could be painful for a long while. Could take years before we see a proper recovery in certain asset classes. Be aware, if you try to time the bottom in this market it might put you through the grinder for a long time before you see a return. You need brass balls, and you need to make sure you have enough cash to weather any storms. \n\nConsider in 2008 it wasn't until a year after the recession was officially declared that unemployment  reached it's peak of around 10%. The dotcom bubble forced the Nasdaq into the red for about a decade before it reached it's previous highs. This time around the Fed has to do a lot of damage to get inflation under control and it's nowhere close to being done yet. Don't assume the market will act as it has for the past decade, if something unexpected breaks in the world economy in the midst of this recession it can get really scary really fast.",

It is a disproportionately better time to buy stocks because of the recent declines in stock prices, and obviously much better than 12 months ago.  The steeper of a discount to the last all-time high you buy, the better your forward-going returns.\n\nSo, what's the catch?\n\nYes, you should buy \"extra\" stock right now, **but with what money**?  The problem with market timing is not really identifying a bottom, but rather determining when you are supposed to wait for it.  The only way you actually *benefited* from the current discount on equities is because you have *extra* cash that you didn't use to buy stocks in the past.\n\nNow, it turns out that if you chose not to buy in December 2021 and waited for this drop, you are winning.  But statistically, that's wrong - after a major drop, you don't have a clue when the market is \"too high\" and you should stop buying.  If you said the time to get out of the market was December 2021, you look great.  But you easily could have made the same argument in August 2020 or December 2013, and you'd look like an absolute idiot.  \"Buy the dip\" as a market-timing strategy doesn't fail because the dip isn't a good time to buy (it is), but rather because you have no idea when to start *waiting for a dip* versus one not coming soon enough.  Spotting a bottom is a very forgiving exercise: you don't need to be very precise to profit from it.  It's identifying a *top* that is exacting and impossible.  Because stocks on average go up (and go up quite a lot), getting into the market too early isn't a big problem, but sitting out too long is a *huge* one.\n\nIn short, yes, stocks are on sale and it is a better-than-average time to buy them.  But if you have any \"extra\" funds available to purchase them right now, either:\n\n* You got lucky, because it was a good time to suddenly come into a bunch of cash, or\n* You got lucky, because you made the (statistically) stupid decision not to use it to buy stocks earlier\n\nIf you can \"stretch\" to \"buy more stocks at a discount\", sure that's a good idea.  But it's **always** a good idea - that's just another way of saying that saving more money is good.",

Maybe it's timing the market when I double my DCA amount when we do dip by 20%, but I'd rather do that than risk buying in higher. Said another way, I am more worried about missing dips than missing peaks.\n\nI'm hoping that next year or the year after I can just max out my IRA on January 1st, but until then, I'm happy with my modified DCA.

But you invested a lump sum, so you have to live with that. \n\nDo you think those companies will continue to experience growth and continue to increase profits for shareholders? If so, it might be wise to sit on your investments, especially since you don't need the money. \n\nI bought on the way down and the way up in 2020. After holding a year to lock in long-term capital gains taxes, I was sitting on a 50% profit easy- simply by doing what you did, buying quality companies. It's just a waiting game.",

This is why \"long term\" investments are considered 5+ years, and that given enough time (say over a 30 year period) you'll *probably* have more winners than losers.\n\nConsider another way; if you were *guaranteed* to beat your 0.5% interest rate investing in the market, why would anyone ever put money in a savings account when they could guarantee greater returns investing? The promise of greater returns requires some risk, you just happened to be unlucky with your timing.",

If 1 year of a 15% loss makes you want to go to cash, you need a more conservative investment approach.  Broad funds will smooth that out.

A downtrend happening now, while you are DCAing, allows you to pick up the index on the cheap, and will overall likely help your portfolio in the long run.  A downtrend happening near the beginning of your retirement, if you are still heavy in the index then, will overall likely result in you selling when you'd rather be buying.\n\nTake a look at firecalc.com, they will outline 3 people who retired with the same amount while withdrawing the same...the only thing different is WHEN they began their retirement.  Very informative...\n\nRegardless, I can see why you think this sucks, lol, the market helping you means the market going up, not down, yes?

Never put money in that you need to take out in less than 5 years. You can even lose money in 7 or 10 years.\n\nLook at the dotcom bust. The high point of the S&P 500 before the drop was 1520.77 at close on 8/28/2000. It didn't reach that point or higher until 5/28/2007, when it hit 1536.34. This was just about 7 years before a break even (if you had been DCAing the whole time during the bust, you'd have made out like a bandit though). But the market reached only a high of 1561.8 (only about 30 points higher) in 10/8/2007, then the 2008 recession basically hit, and we didn't break even again until 3/25/2013 when the market closed at 1569.19. So one could argue this was almost 13 years of the market being down (if you had the unfortunate luck to lump sum invest on 8/28/2000). If you were DCAing the whole time though, you'd have made a lot of money. This is a long term play, and when the market dips, it goes on sale.\n\nYou can also look at the market during the great depression. It hit a peak of 31.83 at close on 9/2/~~1928~~ 1929, and didn't come back until 9/20/1954 when it hit 32.4 at close. There are times where the market can be down a while. You need to plan accordingly.\n\nSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)\n\nEdit: fixed date for great depression market",

My wife and I make decent money (and we have an emergency fund, we cover all of our expenses comfortably, we have retirement accounts, etc.) so I figured putting in a small amount of money just to see how it would do could be fun/informative/good practice.  I had no idea what I was doing, clearly, and after reading some of the basics (the *very* basics) I decided to buy stocks like VTI, Google, Apple, Pfizer, FBGRX, and Disney.  These seemed like pretty reliable and conservative choices, so I imagined that a year down the line I'd have a little more money than what I started with.\n\nWell, here we are a year later and I have 15% less money than I did at the beginning.  I'm tempted to just pull it all out and throw it right back into the savings account it came from with the rest of our money, but that seems stupid.  In total, we have about $50k that we could invest just for shits and giggles.  Any thoughts?  Should I just consult with a financial advisor?",

              "body": "I agree with you 100% for most working people, not borrowing is a better choice.  Spend less and pay cash.  Buy the SE model instead of the LE and get it used and pay cash.   Or buy a Toyota instead of the Lexus you think you deserve.  Same damn car, in many cases.  Buy it used, and you really save.\n\nMost folks use these \"opportunity cost\" arguments to convince themselves they can afford a Lexus or BMW or Mercedes, because the difference in monthly price is small, and the interest rate is low.  They use the same arguments to convince themselves to lease cars, often with catastrophic results (thousands of dollars in excess wear and mileage fees at the end - and money spent that could have bought the same car outright, lightly used).\n\nThere are some exceptions, of course.\n\nFor a retiree living on a 401(k) or pension, borrowing *might* make sense.\n\nFor example, suppose you (a single person) want to buy a $15,000 car and you are living on a combined income from your 401(k)/IRA of $37,650 a year - which is taxed at a marginal rate of 15%.  If you take out another $25,000 that will be taxed at the marginal rate of 25% - negating most of not all of the savings in interest.\n\nhttp://taxfoundation.org/article/2016-tax-brackets\n\nI am in this situation.   Having a lot of money in your IRA is great, but taking it out is something you have to do slowly over time.  For example, paying off a mortgage with an IRA could really kill you as it might put you in some of the highest brackets - negating the tax advantage of the IRA.\n\nSince I am debt-free, I can live in the 15% bracket and pay little in the way of taxes.   Making a one-time withdrawal might bump me into the next bracket, and there is a HUGE leap from 15% to 25% - the single biggest jump in the tax brackets, and right smack dab in the middle of the middle class!\n\nFor pensioners, there may be no choice.  Many have little in savings but steady monthly checks, so they borrow even into retirement to pay for everything.  But who has a big pension anymore, right?\n\nI have friends who have combined six figure government pensions.  They are in their 70's and still have a mortgage, car payments, boat payments, etc.   They have $30,000 in savings.   A different way to live, to be sure.   They pay banks a lot of money, over the years.\n\nMyself, I am more of a debt-free kind of person.  But I could see where a 0% loan might be better than a one-time withdrawal from my IRA.\n\nEDIT:  Some of you may laugh at the idea of living on $37,650 a year.  But for example, if you own a $300,000 house, you are paying about $18,000 a year in mortgage payments.   While mortgage interest might be deductible, at the end of the mortgage, there is very little interest paid - to the point where the standard deduction makes more sense.   To make that additional $18,000 a year, you'd have to EARN about $26,000 a year more (to cover taxes) which means an equivalent income of $63,650.\n\nSo, if a guy has no mortgage and makes $37,650 a year and his neighbor has mortgage on a similar $300,000 house and makes $63,650, they really have equivalent incomes.  The difference is, the neighbor pays a lot more in taxes - at a higher marginal rate - and also pays the banks a lot more money as well, over the years.\n\nAlways have to think of the tax angle.   For student loans and mortgages, the interest may be deductible.  For car loans, no.",

Either I can put that money in an S&P investment account each month or in a bank account which will be used to buy the car. If I put it in the bank account it would take me 27 months to save for a car. If instead I had put that money into an investment account I would have $41,500. Now that doesn't seem like a huge difference that $41,500 vs 40,000 BUT you have going to take a 6 year car loan at 2% and leave that money invested (for ease we don't add any money to this investment account). Over the next 6 years that investment account grows to $63,000 just on compound interest alone assuming a 7% return! So you are now $23,000 ahead of where you would have been if you had spend that money upfront on the car. But wait you say we paid interest because we took out a loan. Oh year you are correct- that interest is $2500 so I guess you are only like $21,500 ahead. Even if you invest the money you would have used for a car loan you would have only made about $3000 in return because compound interest is exponential. Now say you applied this to like a house at $300K. Buy investing instead of paying off your mortgage early you are often ahead by like $100K!",

So I am better off\"\n\nLook I get what you are saying but in reality this never happens. People don't actually take the money they claim to be saving and invest it.

OK, that means you don't have enough additional cash on hand that leaves you comfortable. AKA you cannot afford it. \n\nThe worst lies we tell are the ones we tell to ourselves.

            "data": {
              "body": "First of all, I don't know where you live so the \"right\" answer will depend a lot on that due to cost of living. $130k post tax in South Carolina? You're a king. $130k in the Bay area? You're practically homeless. So adjust my reply accordingly. That being said, you're in a great position to ensure you are financially sound the rest of your working life and in your (early if you desire) retirement. If I were in your position, here's what I would do:\n\n1st: Pay of the credit card and furniture account (unless it's a 0% for XX months agreement) now. IF interest is already being applied, it is just throwing away money.\n\n2nd: If your car loan is above 2%, pay it off. If not, don't sweat if. The payment is a drop in the bucket in relation to your income and that money could be used to earn you greater than 2% resulting in a net profit just by carrying that debt.\n\n3rd: As far as your credit goes, you do want to improve your score. While it's not terrible, you'll want it as high as possible so down the road if you decide to utilize home equity for a renovation project or maybe purchase some investment property, you can use your credit as leverage to make your cash work harder for you. My suggestion to improve your credit score is keep 2-3 good credit cards and use them for EVERY purchase. This is going to require you to be meticulous about your budget. Just because it is a high budget, doesn't mean you don't have to be very active in sticking to it. Always pay the credit cards off in full every month. At your income level, there is no need to pay interest for the convenience of carrying a balance...yes, even though you can afford it.\n\n4th: Retirement planning. You can save $26,800 a year in retirement/tax deferred savings, assuming your job has a high deductible heath plan with an HSA. If not, that number goes down to $23,500. Several people are telling you to use a Roth IRA, but you don't qualify due to your income. Look into a backdoor Roth. I would max out the IRA and HSA on Jan 1st every year, and set your 401(k) contribution percentage to assure you reach the $18k mark every year.\n\n5th: Additional savings: If your job is VERY stable, then you should keep 3-6 months of cash on hand. If it is not, then 6-12 months. Once you reach this amount of cash, then I personally would stop saving cash unless it had a purpose (home purchase, vacation, etc). Any additional amount you can save after this I would stick in a taxable brokerage account (this is where you make more than that 2% on your car loan). This is also the bucket where you think about any charitable contributions you'd like to make. Charities are very important to some with the means you have, and not as much to others. It's not my place to make judgements on others, but I look at it like this; If you contribute to charities, it can help you out at tax time AND it can help those in need. If you can choose to help yourself and others, or no one at all, why would you choose the latter?\n\n6th: ENJOY LIFE!!! Many people here are going to tell you to save every damn dime for retirement. I completely disagree with this mentality. You have a lot of life ahead of you and you need to make sure you are enjoying it to the fullest. High income can consume a lot of peoples lives whether they're hoarding it without enjoying it, or blowing it to have a certain life status. If you make good decisions and form good habits now, you can enjoy a nice cozy life from here on out. Buy/do things because you've determined that it fits into your plan and not just because you can afford it.\n\nYou're in a great position. If you play your cards right, you're on your way to a very happy journey. Best of luck with everything!  ",

The question you need to ask is would you rather pay taxes on the income now and have tax free returns later (Roth). Pay no taxes now but be taxed as income later (traditional IRA and 401k). There is also a third option people tend to forget, just a standard investment account to trade stocks and ETFs.\n\nI know you miss out on the tax savings on your W2 now. However, you end up paying taxes later and it is all taxed as income, including the capitol gains. If you think about it, the money you invest now will be chump change compared to the returns you will see 40 years from now, on that said income. So you are trading paying income tax now for paying income tax on the initial investment plus all gains later. With an investment account, your returns 40 years from now are taxed at capital gains rates, which are lower than income taxes. If you ran the numbers you would be surprised how much of a difference it is. You also have much greater flexibility and liquidity with this account. \n\nSo I would look into a mix of investments into 401k, IRA (of your preferred flavor), and just a regular investment account at Scottrade, Fidelity, Ameritrade.... \n\nLastly, you are at an income bracket where talking to a CPA wouldn't hurt. They can help guide you through finding the right balance for you. They can show you the advantages and disadvantages I listed in much greater detail. Even if you do not want to visit a CPA every year, I would recommend talking to one at least once.

I usually carry 2 credit cards - you don't have to have a jillion accounts, or really do anything special.  History + reliable payment = good credit.\n\nFor retirement, with the level of income you have you should max out the tax benefits of any 401K your employer might offer, and then consider a Roth IRA on top of that.\n\nThe recommended formula for emergency savings is roughly 3 times net monthly salary.

              "body": "Well, you're not in bad shape, so don't beat yourself up too much.  The only blemish is the 5K in credit card debt, which you should pay off immediately.  That debt is probably at somewhere between 18%-30%, and even at the low end of that its not worth taking the time to pay it down if you've got the money in savings.  With the furniture, it might be best to pay it off just so its one less thing.  The car loan probably doesn't matter much if you pay it off now or continue paying.  I'll advocate for keeping up the payments, but I'll tell you why in a sec.\n\nAs far as retirement.  Its good that you're putting away money in your 401k.  However, by some \"back of a napkin\" calculations, you're only putting away about $16,900 when you could be putting away $18k.  With your level of income, you should be maxing out your 401k regardless of employer match.  \n\nI noticed you didn't mention any IRA, which you should try and take advantage of, but might be tough based on your income levels.  First off, with your income levels, you can't contribute to a Traditional (i.e. tax deferred) IRA at all, but you can contribute to a Roth IRA.  You'll have to do what is called a [\"backdoor Roth IRA\"](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Backdoor_Roth_IRA).  I think you can contribute directly to a Roth IRA, but you're also getting pretty close to the levels where you can't do that either (see [this table](http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Amount-of-Roth-IRA-Contributions-That-You-Can-Make-For-2015))  I'm a little fuzzy on this, so do a bit more research to figure out what you'll need to do based on your exact income, but you should consider putting away this extra money for retirement.\n\nYou might also consider contributing to a Roth 401k instead of a traditional 401k.  With your level of income, you could certainly still max out your 401k contribution, which means that you're paying taxes now rather than when you retire.  All things considered, tax rates for your income bracket have more potential to go up than down, so it might be better to pay that tax now.\n\nLastly, your asset allocation in your 401k should really be targeted towards stocks.  The rule of thumb is your age in bonds, and when you're your age, you could argue for even a little less than that.  You're young and you can afford risk, so your allocation should reflect that. One of the worst things you could do is to put money in your 401k and have it in a very conservative allocation.  You need your money to be growing aggressively.\n\nCredit score.  Chances are yours is low because of a lack of history rather than any specific issues.  Whatever your oldest credit card is, whatever you do, DON'T cancel it, as that will incur a huge hit.  Secondly, make sure that your debts are reported on your credit score.  The best thing that you can do is have a history of on time payments.  The car loan definitely should be (which is why it'd be a good idea just to keep up with the payments rather than paying it off), but the furniture might not be.  Also, if you have rent that you're paying each month for an apartment (just assuming), then you might be able to get those payments reported as well, which would help.  Lastly, depending on your limit for your credit card, having a 5K balance might have been hurting you as well.  That's another reason to pay that off.\n\nEmergency Fund.  Simple, 6 months of living expenses which at the very least should include rent, loan payments, bills, and food.  As far as where to keep it, I use an [online bank](http://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/earning-interest/best-online-savings-accounts275921001) and get a pretty good rate for a highly liquid savings account.\n\n>...but that also means I have no idea what I'm doing with my money. I don't know if it's better to just throw it into a savings account and sit on it or throw it at stocks\n\nThe biggest thing with your income level and your young age is to max out as much of your retirement contribution as possible.  Doing so will give you easily an extra million dollars compared to trying to ramp up your retirement savings once you hit your thirties.  Time is your biggest asset when it comes to saving for your retirement, and you have not only the time, but the resources to get started with your pedal to the metal.  Do it, and you'll thank yourself in a decade that you did.\n\nAs far as what to really do with your money after maxing out retirement, paying off debts, and building an emergency fund, that's a question of what you want to do with your life.  One thing that you didn't mention that I think you should seriously think about is buying a home.  You should get an idea of what you'd like to buy, figure out how much that will cost you, and start saving for a down payment.  Even if you're not ready to buy for another handful of years, its a good idea to start saving for a down payment.",

I put away 13% into my 401k every paycheck (which ends up being ~$560 last time I checked).  My equifax credit score is 673.\n\nMy debts include:\n\n- ~5k left on my car\n\n- ~5k left on my credit card\n\n- ~1k left on a miscellaneous payment plan for furniture\n\nSome initial questions I have:\n\n- Is it bad for my credit if I were to just pay off the car loan all at once?  I hate it looming over my head, despite it not really being an issue.  I'd rather just pay it all off and get rid of it, but only if it doesn't adversely affect my credit rating.\n\n- On a related note, what can / should I be doing to raise my credit score?\n\n- I am curious on what your suggestions would be for a retirement plan\n\n- Is there a recommended formula to calculate what my emergency savings should be?\n\n- Any recommended resources / reads?\n\nI grew up in a financially irresponsible family, which has lent to my avoidance of serious debt, but that also means I have no idea what I'm doing with my money.  I don't know if it's better to just throw it into a savings account and sit on it or throw it at stocks, or what my options are with other retirement fund types.  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.\n\nIf there's any other information I could give you that would be helpful, I'd be glad to supply it.\n\nThanks for your time",

Absolutely, but In my opinion would take a very diligent and intentional effort. \n\nWife and I have been here for about 8 years so I\u2019d like to think I have experience in this. We\u2019re money conscious but by no means deal hunters or penny pinchers. We live in one of the greatest cities in the world so want to make sure we\u2019re taking advantage. \n\nRent will have the largest variance. If you\u2019re hoping to live in one of those high-risey type buildings with a pool, weight room, etc that will be much closer to $3,500-$4,000 even with 1 bedroom depending on how close you want to be to downtown. If you\u2019d like to live in one of those brownstone type 3-6 flats that are very common around the city then $2,500 will get you there even for a 2 bedroom but you\u2019ll be further out of the city. Location is a big deal here, $2,500 goes a long way in a neighborhood like Logan square, Lincoln square, or edgewater. Not so much in Lincoln park or river north. \n\nYour eating out and groceries also seem very conservative. Again, could you Buckle down and keep those expenses low? Of course. Groceries I think you could easily do that. Lots of little corner shops and Mexican grocery stores that are vastly cheaper than a Whole Foods or Trader Joe\u2019s. Your eating out will likely be a lot more. \n\nUtilities are going to vary too. Our apartment is radiator heat which vastly cuts down on heating obviously and pretty standard that water is included where you live. Could your utilities be that low, possibly but also greater once you factor in ac and gas for heating. Internet is fine, we pay $50 for 70mbps. Was $30 when we were new customers. \n\nI think in general your spending is pretty spot on but possibly too conservative by possibly 15%-25%. As others have pointed out however you have a lot of buffer with the savings you guys are doing so if you don\u2019t mind eating into that a bit that would allow you to live it up in the city a little more.",

The Comcast offering is 1200 Mbps with a 1.2TB cap and only 35 Mbps upload. \n\nIf my math is correct, that means if you took advantage of your full 1200 Mbps, it would only take 2.2 hours to reach your data cap.

Depending on the neighborhood you could cut that in half, you can live in a nice apartment in a small building in my neighborhood (Andersonville) for $1600 if you look around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd also up the entertainment fund, just a very casual night out for two is going to run you close to $100 (meal & 1-2 drinks).  When I was your age we went out quite a bit, we go out a lot less and easily spend $1000/m on entertainment.  I'd up travel too, sadly Chicago is in the middle of nowhere so getting anywhere is expensive and we don't seem to get the travel deals like they are on the coasts.  Transportation depends on if you want a car or not.  You can certainly get by without a car if you live close to the train, I know lots of people who don't have cars, but having a car adds a level of convenience that a lot of people really like.  If you do choose to have a car you will want a indoor space that can run anywhere from $75-$300+/m, in addition figure $50/m for parking tickets and meters -it's just a fact of life here.

In many senses, they can be exchanged.  Unless you want to be a professional day trader, you have other things to do with you TIME.  Like being young, learning, falling in love, building a career, whatever it may be.  Investing time in those things can be worth WAY more than the money you lost (think income from career, the experiences of college or being in love).\n\nAs for your MONEY, you SHOULD continue learning about the stock market - don't run from it! you now know that daytrading is not a great idea for you and you know more about your own personal risk tolerance.  So what else is there? how can you put your money to work more safely that isn't just running and shoving it under your mattress?  Index funds, saving for retirement, etc.  You've done the hardest part in your 20s - taking the first big loss!  \n\nCongratulations!",

But me being 19 i wanted more, so i started making dumb moves.  I did what i was always told not to do, and what i thought i would never do.  I started trading penny stocks, huge mistake.  I wanted instant success and tried finding an easy route to it.  I have always suffered from depression, so my depression was very severe after this loss.  I was prescribed all kinds of shit. I didn't look at the stock market for at least 3 years after, i wanted to burrow myself into a hole and never come out.  Long story short is i am back in the stock market but only doing long term investing for now.  I may get back into day trading again because i was good at it before i started trying to be greedy.  My depression is at bay and i just look at the situation as a good hard lesson now.  My advise is to quit seeking instant success and satisfaction.  You can seek success but know that its going to take time, hard work, and passion. ",

The \"I don't have any money it's all just borrowed funds\" scam only works when you're a billionaire because there are many facets to it. The moment you forfeit an asset for consideration, even if that consideration is structured as a loan on paper, you are entering tax territory. Otherwise everyone would structure nearly every financial transaction as a loan to evade tax. The IRS is wise to it. Loans without terms. Loans that are forgiven shortly after issuance. These are likely to trigger AML safeguards which can then, in turn, result in the IRS becoming aware.\n\nJust pay your taxes. Or, if you have the money, hire a firm to help you exploit the loopholes. But people coming onto Reddit looking for free expert advice like this are probably not candidates for that level of service. The only real option at this socioeconomic level is to pay your taxes.",

You have none of these liabilities so good on you!\n\nBecause of this, I\u2019d say if your condo is worth anything more than $100k now you are doing great compared to your peers. The more net worth the better of course, so now is the time to start investing in other places than your primary residence to increase your savings.\n\nTLDR: if you don\u2019t live in a dumpy foreclosure-able condo, you are doing great!

Major cash outlays like an all-cash car purchase are fine for people who have access to a large amount of cash but most people simply do not have that much cash lying around and putting forward such a large amount of money increases the risk that they will have to take on debt elsewhere (at higher rates)\n2. Car loan rates are relatively low: Most auto purchases count as \"secured debt\" and, as such, often have low APRs. In addition, the car companies often subsidize these rates further to drive sales.\n3. Cash provides no advantage in car purchase negotiations: The dealership often gets a commission for the loan. It gets nothing for accepting cash since getting cash from you vs cash from the car company's finance organization is the same thing as far as they're concerned.\n4. Uber/Biking is NOT an option for most of the country: In many suburbs and most of the middle of the country, biking and uber are simply NOT a viable option. I live in the North East where the temperatures regularly drop below freezing and we have many feet of snow accumulated on the ground. The idea of riding my bike 30 miles to work and back is absurd. So is the idea of paying $75 each way for an Uber ride. Not to mention the fact that I would need a car for groceries, take my kid to activities, and need it for possible emergencies. It may not be a requirement for YOU but its a requirement for MOST people especially if they have kids (best of luck finding an Uber with a car seat in the 'burbs).\n5. The \"but you're not going to do it\" argument is silly. Just because SOME people might not do it doesn't mean its NOT a good decision in and of itself. What they are doing is calculating the opportunity cost. Based on their analysis, they are right. Whether they act on the second part (invest in the stock market) has NO bearing on whether the first part (getting a low APR car loan instead of lump sum cash payment) is the right choice.\n\n&#x200B;",

With that came the unpleasant realization that the issue really isn't credit itself, it's actually just the tendency of irrational behavior when it comes to personal finance.\n\nAt this point there's just no way I could justify paying cash for a vehicle.  I shopped around, haggled, and accepted a 0% finance.  I did have the capacity to purchase it outright, and I did choose to keep that earning >0% instead of depleting the cash.  If you can't/don't do that, then at best you're buying a vehicle you can afford but then wasting the money you would have used to buy the car, at worst you're over-extending yourself buying a car you can't actually afford.  Both scenarios are doing it wrong.  If you can't afford it you can't afford it, nothing is wrong with that.  Just because it's possible to obtain too much credit, that doesn't mean you can afford it.  People are getting confused on that front.\n\nThe answer isn't to avoid credit or car loans, it's to address the behavior that is leading to using credit irresponsibly.

So many people, especially the younger ones, get themselves in a whole heap of financial trouble by financing cars that are well beyond their income range.  Most get these high interest, long term (up to 84 months...seriously wtf!) loans and just start a car debt cycle that they continue for their entire life.  I know plenty of people in real life that do the same.  I've watched co-workers finally get out of debt only to buy a $50,000 vehicle to \"treat themselves\" while they are only putting $50 per paycheck into their retirement accounts.....and they wonder why they feel they will never retire.\n\nI believe it just boils down to a combination of financial ignorance, lack of discipline, and lack of looking no further in life than about 2 weeks.  While the 80s was a great decade, it started the American trend of over-consumption and living in massive debt being a normal way of life.

All the used cars around $10k were 10 years old and many of them were surprisingly crappy - I drove an Audi that had obvious tranny problems, some VW's and american cars that were just cheap and/or rattletraps. I looked at many used cars and weighed the cost vs age and and decided a 2 year old certified car was my best bang for buck.  The car ($22k new) depreciated something like 6k in the first two years and it would possibly take many more years for the next 6k.  It has depreciated $2k in the 2 years I have had it. I have put about $1.5k in maintenance (800 of that in tires), 1.5k in gas and 2k in insurance.  So in my case, apart from the purchase price, the car costs me $10 per day just to own and use.  Getting a car is expensive, go without if you can.    \nMy personal preference is that the car sale price be less than 20% of  your gross income and you put a fair amount down, like 20%.  \n",

Sure, a used car perhaps is fine for all of that. The point (and your question) is, why a loan?\n\nThe loan offers less risk (edit: and more comfort) than a 10000 purchase on a depreciating asset (they both depreciate, I know this). That's my argument. A new car is more than likely not going to have any major issues over 5 years. And the major stuff would be covered under a 100,000 mile warranty and some insurances. A 10000, 10 year old car, might. And to weed that out with good research probably won't make a lot of sense from a time value and stress perspective. A 500 a month payment is 17 a day. If I get paid 30 an hour, five days a week, how much am I going to research a car that nets me better savings?\n\n10000 over 5 years per month is 166. Net difference is 334, or 11 dollars extra a day. 30 an hour (precluding taxes) is 240 a day for an 8 hour day. and 500 a month over 5 years is a 30000 new car, for example only.\n\nI love my weekends. I don't want to spend too much time car shopping. 11 dollars extra a day? For a car that I need to be reliable, comfortable, safe, 11 dollars a day is an ok price to have to pay to save all of the stress and hassle up front. (2nd Edit: That's justifying. Might be a hypocrite here. But this is where I sit my flag as to why a loan. It's more convienient and you typically can get a nicer car out of the deal.)\n\nI should also state, I've never bought a car. I've been incredibly fortunate with donations from my external family.

              "body": "I think it all comes down to personal preference, not financial sense. \n\nPaying full for a used car seems weird to me. 10000 up front? I have no idea what the idiot on the other side of the road is going to do! What if my car gets totaled? What if I get totaled in the process? I'll need that 10000!! I'd have to take on a loan just to repair the car and myself including insurance costs. If I was paying 200 dollars each month and held on to the 10000, I could hedge that bet with low financial risk. 200 dollars a month becomes much easier to stomach in that case, and maybe I'll splurge to 350 for the leather and heated seats too. I hate the look of stained fabric. (New cars don't cost 10000, but it's to make a point). Oh yeah, I spent MONTHS sacrficing my life to make that 10000. I'd rather hold on to it for emergencies or some interesting, once in a lifetime opportunity, not on a one time purchase of some car I can just finance for 200-350 a month and still have money leftover each month.\n\nAnother thing: If I'm a car guy, and *I really love cars*, I'm going to buy the car I want and it will be the one thing I want to use all the time regardless of expense. I'd budget out to see how much car I could afford. I'd basically work for my car.\n\nAnother another thing: If I'm a young professional, I want a nice car because I've never had a nice car (unless other parental circumstance has been given). I need a nice car because I have to look the part at my job. I can't look like a slob! I'm young, I need upward momentum! I may not try to get a super duper expensive sports car like my car buddy, but I'll buy my nice car because it supports my image of myself as a newly minted (and perhaps naive) member of society. <---- perhaps the biggest culprit of a car loan.\n\nIf I'm a professional single father with 2 or more kids, space and safety are key. A used car may be cheap, but can it be 100% safe for my kids? What would happen if the airbags weren't good due to some abuse or dealer oversight? A more valued car comes with better warranties and maintence, and less users who could have abused it. I can afford to have the extra features that the car provides, so I'll buy it over the used car because it means I'll save hassle trying to keep an older, cheaper car running and spend more of the time with my kids.\n\nWhat if I'm incredibly active and like to go outdoors? A bigger car could be necessary to transport my gear. Towing is a thing that needs to happen, and I'll buy based off the cars capabilities. These cars are more expensive so therefore I'll have to pay more, and I'd take a loan so I can keep my gear updated over the long haul.\n\nIf I'm a person who really likes to save money, or just needs a second car to commute to work in addition to my wife's, cheap car it is. \n\nOfc this is assuming everyone is me and has the ability to say no to affluent and non necessary purchases. It's a different story if I had a 35k - 50k year job. I currently make 80k. But I would just scale this down by the appropriate factor to fit my budget.\n\nIt depends on things though. There can be some people who make shortsighted decisions that have ended up in a situation they didn't forsee a few years prior. You can't magically forgive the debt, so you have to carry it around with you to your monthly budget. Maybe a few years ago, this nice mercedez they financed made ok financial sense cuz they had plenty of spare cash, was single, and didn't forsee a girlfriend with kids in the short term. Then WHAM.\n\nI am a young professional. I was gifted a car from my parents and it's an SUV. All I pay is gas. I can use it to go to the mountains and for outdoor activities. I'm blessed to not need a car loan. But even though I currently don't have a car loan, I will still probably get a car loan for my next car. I have never bought a car, and I can't part with 10000 that easily to someone who in my eyes is a sneaky MF who is trying to make himself more money. If I buy that 10000 used car and it sucks? I've lost 3000 before I got home. Additonally, researching a car is tough, especially when you NEED one and have other life responsibilities. You could go cheap, and research while it's cheap. Or you could pay someone 500 bucks a month for a nice car and not have to worry about researching because your time is more valuable than trying to save and get a great 10000 depreciating asset. There's just too many diminishing returns.\n\nAnd just because your car is safe and reliable for 10000 doesn't mean every 10000 car is going to be the same. You'll never be able to tell what's inside that box of chocolates until you take it home and open it up. Who knows, the keebler terrorists could have had some fun with chocolate bombs, and not the tasty kind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy short and sweet of it is, a car loan on a nice car is easier to do and more valuable to me than painstakingly researching and trying to find and bid for a suitable used car that fits a cash budget. Yes, I'll still do some research. No, I won't buy a sportscar. But working tirelessly to find a car that fits a cash budget, especially if I need that cash to take plane trips to weddings or to see my family in a different locale, doesn't make sense.

I make six figures and will be buying a $30k new car, upgrading from my 18 year old camry that was also bought new. I work a government job so it's stable, and the payment is well within my budget. Even if I needed to pay off the entire loan at once, I could do it without going into crisis, but I'm choosing not to. The upgrade isn't just for better looks (though that is admitted part of it because I like cars), but also much improved safety features, convenience, and reliability. I plan to drive this new car for 10+ years too.\n\n2. I put money in the stock market passively by changing my 401k contribution, which is invest in some Vanguard funds. So technically yes, I can reduce my over-contribution (I currently contribute more than the recommended 15%), save the cash, and buy the car outright. But instead I'm choosing the keep my contributions high and take on a reasonable monthly payment instead. So yes, it can be very easy to invest in the stock market. Also, with my high credit score, I qualify for <2% loan rates easily.\n\n3. Whether you're underwater depends on your down payment and what car you buy. As I'm planning to buy a Camry or Accord, and those only depreciate a few thousand a year, I mitigate the underwater risk by putting down a few thousand in down payment. At no point during my loan will I be underwater. I believe this is true for many loans, though r/pf tends to hear about the worst one where people buy cars that don't keep value, didn't put enough down, and didn't get gap insurance.\n\n4. I always carry comprehensive insurance on my cars so my insurance isn't impacted whether there's a loan or not.\n\n5. Live in middle America and cars are absolutely needed. If I move back to NYC I'd reconsider a car, or at least a nice car. Also, lots of people drive for fun, not just to get from point A to B.\n\nThe way I see it, heavily financed, new cars are kinda like vacation timeshares-- they're a bad idea for a lot of people, but they can be a nice luxury for people who meet a specific set of conditions. Those conditions include being financially stable, prioritizing your car (whether as a hobby, or safety, or even status), etc. The problem is most people barely meet the \"financially stable\" criterion, nevermind the rest, and that can lead to problems.",

If you would have been fine dropping $750 cash on a new phone, then fine, go for it. \n\nI can only assume, but I would think if you placed a $300 phone next to the new $1100 iphone and asked consumers which one they would pay cash for. Most would choose the $300 as the difference in features is minuscule compared to the almost 4x cost increase. But instead, when you break the iPhone into $50/month cost, it becomes a popular purchase.",

There's a reason cost goes up and up and up, it's because the feature lists grow longer and longer and longer. Most phone screens have bigger display resolutions than your average home TV on 1/20 the size. CPU power is equal or better to desktop computers. A modern 4G phone has higher data rates than most DSL lines can supply - only fiber and DOCSIS/cable can match. And all of this on a battery that gets slimmer and slimmer with each integration.\n\nAnd that's just the \"ordinary\" features. Shit like notch *cutouts* in a display? I'm no stranger to new tech trends and how-shit-works and regularly repair my phones and computers myself, but I can't even imagine how that is manufactured!\n\nAll this has an *immense* R&D cost which is reflected in the purchase price. For iPhones, there is the additional cost that Apple takes in providing OS upgrades. In the Android world you gotta be happy with a year of months-delayed security updates and that's it.",

        "body": "Long time lurker, first time poster. As the title states, I am curious how we (in the US) have gotten to the point where the default thinking pattern is that everyone should have a car loan at all times. Just scrolling through on personal finance, a huge percentage of people in financial distress are in the position they are in at least partially because of car loans. It blows my mind how many examples I see on here of people that make $50k a year and purchase $30k+ cars. The part that really gets me though is that while even though people that come in and give advice say the car is too much, it seems the prevailing mentality on here is that car loans are entirely acceptable and normal, those people just spent too much. \n\nI think a lot of times posters on here get too caught up in the numbers game and math. Basically it usually goes something like this \u201cwell the bank gave me 0.9% interest and I can get 8% on the stock market so this is basically free money\u201d.   I have several issues with this line of reasoning, which I will outline below. \n\n1.\t Getting a loan encourages people to spend more money then they have. I put this one first for a reason, because I think it is by far the biggest issue. None of these people making $50k a year would ever buy a car so expensive if they had the cash in their bank account and had to actually part with that much money. The concept of \u201cwell the monthly payment is only $450, I can afford that (for now)\u201d lulls you into spending upwards of 50% of your yearly salary on a car.   If you had to separate with thousands on your hard earned cash right there on the spot would you really upgrade to leather and GPS?\n2.\t Are you actually going to put that money in the stock market?  The above example of \u201cI can do better on the stock market\u201d only works if you actually put the money in the stock market. Basically if you want to buy a $20k car, in order to come out ahead you need to have $20k in the bank, but instead of using it on the car move it to an investment account. I doubt many people are actually doing that, instead I would be willing to bet the vast majority are financing the car because they don\u2019t have the money to buy it. If that is the case, then regardless of how low the interest rate is you are just paying interest, not \u201cgetting free money.\u201d\n3.\t Financing a car impairs your ability to sell the car if your situation changes. Cars are a depreciating asset, so unless you put a very large down payment toward the car, there is a good chance you will spend a large amount of the loan duration upside down. There are countless examples of people on this sub who are underwater and therefore feel they can\u2019t get rid of the car because they would have to pay to sell it. If you own your car outright you can always get money out of it by selling regardless of depreciation. \n4.\tThere are costs beyond just interest rates. This has been beat to death on here so I won\u2019t go into it further, but I think we all know it\u2019s not just the interest that adds to the price of the car. Insurance is more expensive if you have a loan, etc etc. \n5.\tYou can buy a bike and lot of uber trips for the price of even a cheap car. We (again Americans) seem to have a mentality that a car is a requirement not a convenience. While everyone\u2019s situation is different, there are a lot of people who could get by without a car for a few months or years while they save up for one. \n\nAnd to people who say that reliable cars and expensive these days, I say absolute hogwash. I have a 10 year old car with leather seats(feels like a luxury car to me), AWD, totally reliable and guess what the retail kbb is on it?... around $7-8k. Could be had even cheaper with more miles or a little older. So if you had $2k for a \u201cdown payment\u201d and saved $500 a month that you would have put toward a car payment you could afford that car within a year. I simply don\u2019t understand how people act like it is an impossible task to save up and buy a car.  I rode the bus in college while working to save up and bought my first car (around $5k or so) in cash. It just really isn\u2019t that hard to do if you eliminate the mindset of having a car loan is the default and normal option.  I wish the advice given in this sub was more \u201cavoid a car payment if at all possible\u201d instead of how it seems to me to be \u201cget a car payment, just don\u2019t go overboard\u201d\n\nAnyway, as you can tell this is a bit of a soap box for me, I just hope I convince even one person to actually save up for a car or at least actually consider the full purchase price when choosing a car.

I'm certainly not a personal advice guru - but on an average $38K yearly salary I managed to sock away $100K in property investments (plus another $100K in property investments I pulled out after crypto trading)\n\nBack in the pre Gox crash - I had a rent house I'd fixed up at about your age, sold it & lost $25K in that market (Litecoin from $14 to $2, Vertcoin from $1 to $.05, scammed for an ASIC miner).  I salvaged my loss by throwing the remaining $3K into the Ether ICO & sold at $3 (would be worth $5mil today) and walked away.  This happened over 2 years and make me sick.\n\nThen Ether roared from $4 to $500.  So I've suffered both ends of the spectrum.  Losing it all, missing out on unimaginable (for me - millionaire status) gains.\n\nA buddy of mine managed to convince me to get re-involved in April of last year.  I had just been too sick from my mistakes to touch it until I mentally recovered.  I did extremely well.  $3,500 - $100K.  But I probably only walked away with a good chunk because I've been exposed to extreme loss & extreme missed gains.I'm extremely picky about my trades (only 4 that year).  I look for hidden spots of low risk (leverage longed on Segwit 80&#37; lock in, Monero at .014 / dump on the Korean exchange for .05, 2 20&#37; trades for an ICO that had been delayed when futures settled at end of year if not released - because no one reads contract terms apparently)\n\nAnyway. My .02\n\n* Winning at crypto trades is absolutely toxic.  You likely didn't have a gambling problem before you got that rush.\n* Before you can approach this market healthily (if that's even possible) - you really do need this type of massive loss.\n* The emotional lessons you can learn from this long term are invaluable.  Regardless of if you abandon it forever or just for now.\n* This experience is exactly why I stay quiet & ignore friends who want to talk about crypto to me.  Specifically because I feel it takes this type of loss to have an appropriate mindset about the market.  & I don't want them to have to go thru it.\n* Do NOT get re-involved until you can kick the gambling habit, walk away from this thing completely for months & then come back.  (My attitude on my second round was \"I fucking hate this entire shitshow but there are so many morons ... vs \"moon\")\n* It's ok to be sad.\n* I tend to disagree with both sides of the spectrum advice you are likely to get.  \"HODL!\" & \"Crypto is looney bin run away\" - you just paid a hefty price for the mentality you need to be healthy - which 95&#37; of the participants don't have.",

VIOO and VONG if you use Vanguard and go this route. A little more aggressive approach since we have time on our side.\n\nEmergency Fund - 6x your monthly expenses. Calculate your rent, car, and estimate groceries.\n\nCC Debt - Pay this shit off. First, sell the crypto. You should be bringing home around ~60k cash every year after 401k, which means 2300 a paycheck. Put 1k a paycheck toward that CC debt for 16 paychecks (~7-9 months). More if possible, but at 1k a check you shouldn't have to sacrifice lifestyle, depending on your rent.\n\nThis is the bare minimum saving I'd do. Definitely after your CC debt is gone, and preferably before, start a house/honeymoon/whatever savings, preferably a brokerage account. You can go S&P 500 investments for this too, like $VOO/$SPY. Feeling more aggressive? Go $VGT. Don't get this secondary brokerage account approved for margin or options. If you don't trust yourself, just stick it in a high yield savings. Yeah the return is shit but at least you're not broke.\n",

I've discovered I have a gambling problem and want to invest my money as safely as possible.\n\nI turned my 55K savings into 180K from cryptocurrency, but I barely took any profits out. The market started to crash, but I wasn't phased until I lost almost all my profits as I was sure it would recover again. I was back at around 50K and made the excellent decision to play crypto roulette. After around 3 months of chasing losses, that 50K was now $0.\n\nI am fortunate to only be 25 years old and make a bit over $100K/year, I want to learn from these mistakes and make smart financial decisions from now on for my future. I currently have 5K in savings, 4K in crypto, 30K in my 401K, and 2K in various stocks. I have around 20K of CC debt. What's the smartest thing to do with my money? I figure I should just leave my 401K alone, but I'm not sure what to do with the rest of my savings.\n\nI've been reading posts on /r/problemgambling for the past 3 hours because I've been having a hard time stopping. The roulette website now gives me a daily payout of around $15 per day because of how much I've bet. I usually let that accumulate for around 3 days and then gamble with it, then cashout at a few hundred dollars, but I lost another $900 last night chasing losses from that bonus. I'm thinking of letting someone I trust collect the daily payout for me.",
