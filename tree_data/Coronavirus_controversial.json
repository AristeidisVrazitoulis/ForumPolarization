You can be infected with measles from simply sharing a large space with a patient who you never even see- that\u2019s why it\u2019s so incredibly contagious, with one of the highest R0 values known. When there\u2019s a measles outbreak, public health officials will make announcements that anyone who was present in a large public space like a mall or an airport should be concerned. The last smallpox patient zero was infected while working in a room that shared ventilation systems with a lab on a different floor where they were studying the disease. \n\nWe are not seeing *that* with this, thankfully. It is still possible for it to become aerosolized during certain medical procedures, which is part of why negative pressure rooms and heavy PPE are ideal for hospital staff caring for the patient, but we aren\u2019t seeing the kind of infection patterns you would expect from a truly airborne pathogen like measles.

Are you being obtuse on purpose? You didn't answer the claim. You responded with a claim that had nothing to do with the discussion. Meaning you completely failed to make a point. Next time read the articles you post, and make sure they fit the conversation. About 25 percent watched the superbowl. A small percent. Now what percent do you think had superbowl parties? Probably a tiny  percent of that. Sorry, the superbowl surge really wasn't a thing. Which is why the only article you could find had to do with the location that the superbowl itself was at.  Pretty hilarious, really. That should tell you everything. People just weren't that into the superbowl this year, and gatherings were seemingly quite rare. Also let's not goal post shift here (again) We were literally IN a surge at the time, the fact that it was the tail end, is again, irrelevant. EDIT: just spent 20 minutes on google. The closest thing I could find is the statement: \"some epidemiologists believe their *could* be a surge *if* there are an abundance of superbowl parties\". ( Ny times) So, yeah. That didn't happen. Nor was it predicted it would. It was entirely cautionary. Not at all predicted by necessity. In conclusion you are wrong. Own up to it. Or would you like another chance to deliver what you claimed?",

I feel similarly about Biden. He's spoken about a leadership gap under Trump, but under him there's not a lot of talk about what reopening the country looks like. Obviously it's up to the states, but the restrictions were up to the states in the first place, and the lack of coordination is something Biden criticized Trump for.\n\nThis is obviously all stuff I kinda expect from politicians, but it's annoying to see this kind of behavior so commonly excused on this subreddit. I'd like to see more politicians be treated with as much popular scrutiny as Trump was, maybe that'll bring us closer to accountability.",

They said Remdesivir is a vaccine, but it isnt it is an: after its already infected you treatment. It prevents nothing. So all this hype about vaccines being the savior is only so relevant when you look at the science behind it. Most will only have moderate effectiveness (according to Fauci), and he would be happy with one that was 70% effective as it would end the pandemic, but at the same time if any 10 that would die from it now, that would still leave 3 dead, which is only so good imo.\n\nNot to be all gloom and what not, but this is speculation, the common cold, another coronavirus has yet to be eradicated and that has been around for as long as we have human records. So the fastest way is to social distance and mask up, and for governments to be serious about punishing those who dont, that way the spread is so minimal that it is not as much a threat to the hospital system being overloaded. As we have seen, the longer time goes on with our medical professionals dealing with this, the better the survival rates get. So long as they arent overloaded the death rates stay relatively low, Texas, Arizona, Florida are a perfect example. Mitigating how many people end up in the hospital and the ability of the hospital to keep its workers safe (so the experienced skilled ones dont catch the virus and be taken off the front lines).

Although reaching 100% coverage is nigh impossible. But if the extended dosing regiment puts Oxford/AZ efficacy anywhere near 70%, 75% coverage seems realistic.\n\n>Simulation experiments revealed that to prevent an epidemic (reduce the  peak by >99%), the vaccine efficacy has to be at least 60% when  vaccination coverage is 100% (reproduction number=2.5\u20133.5). This vaccine  efficacy threshold rises to 70% when coverage drops to 75% and up to  80% when coverage drops to 60% when reproduction number is 2.5, rising  to 80% when coverage drops to 75% when the reproduction number is 3.5.\n\n[Vaccine Efficacy Needed for a COVID-19 Coronavirus Vaccine to Prevent or Stop an Epidemic as the Sole Intervention](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7361120/)",

We can\u2019t give these variants too much of an opportunity to spread. The only way we can significantly curtail them is through vaccination efforts and a couple more months of public health measures. The vaccines have proven to still be effective against the variants.

We will not have significantly slowed spread because these groups are not typically the super spreaders and a larger percentage would be vulnerable. Even worse, we run the risk of those who the vaccine isn't as effective in thinking they are protected and taking more chances.\n\nIf you want to slow the spread quicker, you have to aim for essential and public facing workers first. Just slowing the spread alone provides a huge amount of protection to the vulnerable. And if the vaccine is less effective for them when they do get it, they are less likely to get sick because spread of covid is decreasing.\n\nA lot of decisions depend on what the data looks like on a final vaccine. Across the board, however, vaccines are less effective in the elderly and immunocompromised, so I am not confident we'll see a difference in the norm of a mostly  effective vaccine.",

That is relatively simple, but remember the virus can take 10-14 days between infection and symptoms. So potentially, you could have an exposure during your one week study and not see a second degree case until almost a month later. So at a minimum you are looking at 5 weeks of JUST data collection.\n\nNow you have to look at the data. Can you conclusively say that person A transmitted to person B? Only if everything is properly contact traced and genetically sequenced. That is not easy and can take time to contact everyone and piece together the timeline, especially with high rates of the virus in the general population and asymptomatic infection. \n\nWhen you are developing a product, you have to focus on certain things. Usually, baseline performance and safety are two of those. Smaller details get pushed to the side until resources become available. Mask mandates wouldn't go away until a significant portion of the population is vaccinate anyway, so why rush the data to help make that decision? You really want to make sure you get it right.\n\nThere are so many more factors to this, but this vaccine is \"scientifically\" approved because they properly applied the scientific method to prove its safety and efficacy. The data they currently have( and what you are proposing) does not meet the definition of \"good science\", so it wouldn't be approved by anyone in the community. For good reason.",

Clinical trials of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines found that both do a good job preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease, including severe COVID-19. However, the trials did not measure whether a person who is vaccinated is less likely to spread the virus to someone else.\n\n>It's possible that the vaccines protect against COVID-19 disease by preventing a person from becoming infected in the first place. However, it's also possible that the vaccine protects a person from COVID-19 illness, but does not prevent a person from becoming infected. In other words, a vaccinated person may have replicating virus in their nose and throat even if they are protected from becoming sick.\n\n>But does that mean that you have enough virus in your nose and throat to infect someone else? Not necessarily. It's possible that the immune response triggered by the vaccine, which protects you from becoming sick, also reduces the amount of virus in your nose and throat to a point where you are unlikely to spread it to someone else. But we need more research to know for sure.\n\n>The bottom line? If you're among the first groups of people to get vaccinated, it's best to continue wearing masks and maintaining physical distance in order to protect others who haven't yet gotten the vaccine.\n\n[https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus#:~:text=The%20answer%20is%2C%20we,protected%20from%20becoming%20sick](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus#:~:text=The%20answer%20is%2C%20we,protected%20from%20becoming%20sick.)",

My coworker had covid literally a few weeks before they tested his antibody levels and found they were at 800, while the vaccinated people have antibody levels that are 20,000+. His wasn\u2019t even a rare case; other coworkers tested positive for antibodies on the rapid tests from previous infections but when a count was taken they were really low.

              "body": ">Understandably, many parents of young children have questions about the new coronavirus vaccines for babies and toddlers and the expected rollout next week of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots. We talked with infectious disease pediatricians to get answers to the most common ones.\n\n>One specific question came from parents with 4-year-olds, particularly those who are just about to turn 5. Since a two-dose Pfizer vaccine has been available for children between 5 and 11 since last fall, they want to know if it makes sense to wait until their children turn 5 so they can get the more potent version of Pfizer. The Pfizer shots for children younger than 5 would be administered in three doses, which contain three micrograms while those for older children contain 10.\n\n>All the experts said not to wait, recommending that parents of 4-year-olds start the vaccination process as soon as possible, even if that would mean beginning with the lower dose version.\n\n>\u201dThe sooner you start them off getting protection, the better,\u201d said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Stanford Medicine who chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 committee on infectious diseases.\n\n>If your child turns 5 before a second or third dose of the Pfizer vaccine, they would likely get bumped up to receive the higher dose for the rest of the series, said Dr. Debbie-Ann Shirley, a pediatric infectious disease physician at the University of Virginia, as this is what the A.A.P. recommends for older children who transition into a new age group while receiving Covid-19 vaccines.\n\n>So, what about parents of 4-year-olds who are bigger than the average 5- or even 6-year-olds? As Christina Caron reported when the vaccine for school-age children was cleared, it does not matter whether a child is smaller or larger than other children their age when it comes to vaccines.\n\n>Weight is an important factor when you give a young child medication like Tylenol because there is a wide variation in weight from infancy throughout childhood and too much of the drug could be toxic.\n\n>The optimal vaccine dose, however, is dependent on age and tailored to minimize potential side effects.\n\n>Parents with 4-year-olds do have another option, though. Moderna\u2019s vaccine for little kids, which is for children 6 months through 5 years old, would be administered in two doses at a lower dosage than adults. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not yet weighed in on Moderna\u2019s vaccine for children ages 6 to 17.\n\n>Asked to compare the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines for very young children at a press briefing on Friday, Dr. Peter Marks, who leads the F.D.A.\u2019s vaccine division, said that Moderna\u2019s vaccine might trigger an immune response \u201cslightly more rapidly,\u201d while Pfizer\u2019s might \u201cbring a greater response after the third dose.\u201d \n\n>He said parents should feel comfortable with either, and he recommended they go with whichever one is available.",

(yes i know the dosage is different) i'm referring to using the same formula. we need a variant specific vaccine 3 months ago. there data from uk showing the vaccine basically useless against omicron infections other than hospitalizations and death(still good protection there)",

Israel has already given us preliminary evidence of this. \n\nThe main goal and benefit of this vaccine will be prevention of severe cases; hospitalization and deaths in vulnerable groups \n\nAlmost no country will see a 95% 'net' efficacy in terms of reduction in infection (apart from the ones with close to zero community transmission) most will see substantially lower. \n\nWhy? Because the 95% number taken from clinical trials **only starts counting from 7 days post dose 2. It ignores all infections within the last 28 days**\n\nAnd of course,  this timeframe was when most infections occured in the trial !! (39/50 in the first 21 days alone) The vaccine doesn't even fully kick in till 12 days post vaccination. Infections didn't appreciably deviate from placebo until then you can see this right there in the cumulative incidence data\n\nTherefore only way countries like US will see 95% efficacy is of they test like the clinical trial did--  **ignore any infections occuring in people that have been vaccinated in the past month**. Oh and they'd also have to not test anyone who's been vaccinated *at any point* if they're not exhibiting symptoms because pfizer trial only tested those with symptoms. Which made the efficacy against infection appear artificially high. \n\nThey'd also have to advise anyone who has symptoms correlating with vaccine reactogenicity within 7 days of administration (ie headache, fatigue) to not seek out testing unless it was certainly likely to be covid (loss of smell etc) this would reduce positivity further, and is exactly how the trial operated.\n\nIn short: While efficacy may be 95% measured in the vaccines cohorts weeks after their second dose, (vaccine will offer strong protection from that point) that doesn't prevent the demographic from getting infected starting from day 0 which is how we're operating in the real world.\n\n \"True\" real world efficacy in terms of observable real time impact on cases is not going to be close to the 95% figure, it was never possible in any country that has high spread.  And therefore articles like this one start from a false premise that vaccinated \"only\" have a 5% chance of infection, they also seem to confuse immune response here in the article.. \n\neven if 99% of people mount an immune response that doesn't necessarily mean only 1% will be infected..",

              "body": "In case you can\u2019t get past the paywall:\n\n\n**Some vaccine experts having second thoughts about rushing to inoculate kids**\n\nBy\u00a0Melissa Healy | Staff Writer\u00a0\n\nJune 18, 2021 3 AM PT\n\nFrom the earliest days of the pandemic, doctors and public health officials have seen widespread vaccination as the most effective way to stop COVID-19 in its tracks. But a growing contingent of medical experts is now questioning whether that conventional wisdom ought to apply to children.\n\nTheir doubts are not borne of conspiracy beliefs, but couched in the carefully calibrated language of risk and benefit. And they\u2019re expected to get a public airing next week as advisors to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ponder a spate of post-vaccine heart problems in adolescents and young adults.\nNo one is arguing that COVID-19 immunizations for kids should stop altogether. Rather, a debate has erupted over the need to inoculate healthy children as soon as possible and according to the two-dose regimen authorized by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have been administered safely to millions of adults and been vetted in several thousand adolescents. But neither has been subjected to exhaustive testing in diverse pediatric populations, as is typically required for a vaccine intended for universal use in kids.\n\nThe FDA authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use in adolescents as young as 12 on May 10. In the weeks that have followed, the safety monitoring systems managed by the FDA and CDC detected dozens of cases of a possible side effect in newly vaccinated teens: an inflammation of the heart muscle known as myocarditis.\n\nThe cases typically developed in older adolescents, most of them boys, three to four days after they got a second dose. Virtually all were considered mild, presenting as chest pain and tightness that resolved after treatment with over-the-counter medications. None of the patients appear to have died or suffered serious cardiac malfunction, though it\u2019s too early to know whether they will suffer long-term effects.\n\nAs of June 10, the government\u2019s vaccine monitoring systems detected 226 cases of myocarditis or a related condition called pericarditis after vaccination in people younger than 30. Normally, fewer than 100 cases would be expected for this age group, said Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, deputy director of the CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office.\n\nMore investigation is needed to determine whether the vaccine caused these heart problems or if the timing was merely a coincidence, he said.\n\nDr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine specialist at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the reports will give the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices an opportunity to \u201cgive people a clinic on relative risk\u201d \u2014 as it did after the COVID-19 vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson was linked to a rare blood-clotting disorder in younger women but still deemed safe for use.\n\nOffit said he doubts the myocarditis cases will upend the long-standing certainty that kids should be vaccinated quickly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d give it to my child in a second,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers aren\u2019t so sure. The possibility that children getting the vaccine \u2014 especially a second dose \u2014 could put their hearts at risk has amplified calls for more debate before parents, schools and others embrace the conviction that all healthy children need to get vaccinated.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the prospect of a surprise side effect that has prompted the sudden surge in vaccine caution.\n\nAs the pandemic appears to be winding down across the United States and its limited toll on children has been tallied, it\u2019s no longer clear that immunizing children will bring the outbreak to a faster close, said Dr. Martin Makary, a public health expert at Johns Hopkins University.\nMakary is urging his colleagues to \u201cthink twice\u201d before recommending universal COVID-19 vaccination of healthy kids. Given the data in hand, \u201cthere\u2019s no compelling case for it right now,\u201d he wrote this month in MedPage, a website widely read by physicians.\n\nIn an interview, Makary said his concerns might be allayed with a more thorough examination of the safety data.\n\u201cBut no one is thinking like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve converted now from being pro-vaccine to vaccine fanaticism.\u201d\n\nGiven the general decline in new infections and hospitalizations, there\u2019s time for a thorough FDA vetting of the vaccines for children and adolescents, Makary said. Even if it takes months, it could wind up protecting more children from harm.\nThe emerging debate threatens to divide a community that\u2019s largely been united by the pandemic.\n\nFrom the moment that the first COVID-19 vaccine started going into Americans\u2019 arms, one certainty has seemed almost beyond questioning: As soon as enough doses were available, the nation\u2019s children would roll up their sleeves.\n\nThere are strong arguments for that position too.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s clear COVID-19 has largely spared children from severe illness, the CDC says 456 American kids have died of the disease, though that is considered a conservative estimate.\n\nAt least 20,000 \u2014 and as many as 100,000 \u2014 kids have been hospitalized with COVID-19. Indeed, the CDC reports that even as adult hospitalizations declined in March and April, the rate at which adolescents were admitted ticked upward. Nearly one-third were treated in intensive care units, undercutting the argument that severe illness rarely happens in this age group.\n\nCOVID-19\u2019s toll on some children also lingers well beyond a bout of infection. As of mid-May, at least 4,018 in the U.S. have developed a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MISC, that frequently appears four to six weeks after a child has cleared his or her infection and typically requires hospitalization.\n\nMyocarditis is common in these very sick children, and roughly 1% die.\n\nIf COVID-19 were a disease seen only in children, statistics such as these would galvanize medical professionals and public health officials to find a way to protect them, New York pediatrician Dr. Risa Hoshino wrote in a MedPage commentary sparked in part by Makary\u2019s views.\n\nBy any definition, COVID-19 has been an emergency for the nation\u2019s children and the FDA\u2019s emergency use authorization is an \u201cappropriate pathway\u201d for getting vaccines to young Americans, she added.\n\nAt Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, pediatric cardiologist Dr. Jodie Votava-Smith has seen the wreckage of COVID-19 firsthand, and she has no doubts about the value of vaccinating kids.\nIn the last month, she has helped treat a patient who developed myocarditis after a dose of vaccine, she said. The child\u2019s symptoms were mild and readily treated with ibuprofen.\n\nVotava-Smith said her assessment of vaccines\u2019 value has been more profoundly shaped by the dozens of children treated at CHLA for serious heart muscle inflammation as a result of having COVID-19. These children were severely ill and now face potentially enduring health effects. The disease was the cause of their misery, she said, not the vaccine.\nThe mother of two children who are 5 and 7, Votava-Smith said she \u201ccan\u2019t wait\u201d to get them vaccinated. \u201cThey know they\u2019ll be getting their shot when it\u2019s their turn,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. H. Cody Meissner, a Tufts University pediatrician who advises the FDA on vaccines, said it\u2019s a mistake to evaluate COVID-19 vaccines for children in the same way as it was cleared for emergency use in adults.\n\n\u201cThe risk calculation for vaccinating an adult is pretty easy,\u201d he said. When as many as 4,000 adults a day were dying of COVID-19, \u201ceven if there was a little risk of vaccine, most people would accept that.\u201d\nBut for children, he said, \u201cthe calculus is a bit different.\u201d Although they seem to contract the coronavirus pretty readily, they\u2019re far less likely than adults to get sick or die. So even if instances of post-vaccination myocarditis are rare, they still change the risk-benefit analysis.\n\n\u201cThe data are not sufficient to say that the benefit of these COVID-19 vaccines outweighs the risk in children and adolescents,\u201d Meissner said. \u201cWe may get there. But we\u2019re not there now.\u201d\n\n*Times staff writer Sean Greene contributed to this report.*",

The US administered 60 million boosters.  We can produce this supply in like a week.  Withholding those shots would make absolutely 0 difference on the global scale.  We can't get them easily to where they are needed.  Not at the pace that we're producing them.  More spread and more deaths, the only thing it would achieve.\n\n\n[TOP TAKEAWAYS: SPRINTING TOWARDS VACCINE EQUITY WITH DR.

Even if you consider those to be older-tech, there\u2019s always the Adenovirus-vector vaccines like Sputnik V or AstraZeneca, which also use simpler technology (ergo, easier to make) and have storage temperatures more suited to established distributed channels (keep in mind that the distribution channels for pharmaceuticals are prepared for sub-8 Celsius or sub-25 celsius, not minus 70 celsius). Funny how the \u201cpAtENtS\u201d or know-how of these vaccines are never any issue.\n\nPlease, do look up how many GMP-approved pharmaceutical facilities are able to handle lipid microencapsulation followed by lyophilisation and -70\u00baC storage and shipping worldwide, and then come tell me that the problem is all abut MODernA And pfiZEr'S pATEnts\u201d (hint: you\u2019ll be able to count them with the fingers of your left hand)\n\nThe point is always \u201cMODernA And pfiZEr'S pATEnts aRE LImitiNg vAcCiNE PROdUCTION\u201d, but in reality there\u2019s less than a handful of facilities capable of doing these.

              "body": ">**Those immunized can spread the virus if their body's defenses are not as efficient as possible, according to several studies.**  \n>  \n>The registry of infections of people who have passed the covid or who are vaccinated is scarce. But they are given and they are a wake-up call: it is still too early for the open bar, for the return to absolute normality. Different studies have detected infections between 10% and less than 1% of people already immunized, depending on the moment, the group, the place of the investigation and the vaccination schedule. These people, asymptomatic in most cases thanks to natural or vaccine-induced immunity, still retain the ability to harbor and spread the coronavirus for a time, even if they do not develop the disease. According to Guillermo L\u00f3pez Lluch, professor of Cell Biology at the Pablo de Olavide University (UPO), the key to avoiding the danger of contagion being promoted, is \"to achieve the broadest possible group immunity in the shortest period of time.\" \"It is a race against the virus,\" he warns.  \n>  \n>The biologist has been able to verify an infection of an immunized person in a close case: a person close to him, 92 years old and vaccinated with the double dose of one of the brands administered in Spain, had to enter a trauma hospital in Cordova. He was routinely tested for covid and tested positive, despite lacking symptoms consistent with the disease.  \n>  \n>Jocelyn Keehner and Lucy E. Horton, along with other members of the University of California (UCLA) and San Diego (UCSD) Faculties of Medicine, published last March in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) the results of an internal investigation: \u201cThe absolute risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 \\[coronavirus that causes covid\\] after vaccination was 1.19% among UCSD healthcare workers and 0.97 % among those from UCLA; these rates are higher than the risks reported in the trials of the coronavirus vaccine mRNA-12731 \\[Moderna\\] and the vaccine BNT162b2.2 \\[Pfizer-BioNTech\\].\u201d The study shows the same conclusions, although with different figures, as another published last month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States and other previous ones reflected in Nature and the British Medical Journal.  \n>  \n>All these studies confirm the existence of infections in immunized patients, although their record is scarce. L\u00f3pez Lluch explains one reason: \u201cIt is very likely that the cases are more numerous than those detected, since, in most cases, they do not produce symptoms and, therefore, these people, who are considered immunized, are not makes them PCR \u201d. Mark Pandori, director of the Nevada Public Health Laboratory, agrees. \u201cWe are underestimating the cases of reinfection. They are very difficult to determine, you need specialized equipment to do that work or a central laboratory, \"he explains in Scientific American.  \n>  \n>L\u00f3pez Lluch refers to a recent study in The Lancet to argue that, although the immune response generated by vaccination or by the body itself prevents contagion and suffering from the most serious consequences of covid, there are immunized people who become infected and can be a source of spread of the virus, even if they show little or no symptoms.  \n>  \n>The cell biology specialist explains that the cause is the viral load, the amount of virus that circulates in the blood of the infected person. Immunized people have a defense line made up of B and T lymphocytes. \u201cThe former produce antibodies, they hinder the virus from entering the cell. The latter attack it directly and generate intermediaries, such as interferon, the proteins that signal the presence of a virus and prevent its proliferation \u201d, he simplifies to explain it.  \n>  \n>But while this system works to eliminate the infection, a person, even if he does not develop the disease, can maintain a certain viral load. In this sense, L\u00f3pez Lluch explains: \u201cImmunity is a matter of days. While we are not immune, the virus or pathogen has a long time to cause damage that is reflected in the symptoms, which are more serious. Our body's defenses are inefficient and take time, between 10 and 14 days, to fully activate. When we are immune, the response of B and T lymphocytes is faster and the pathogen has less time to cause damage. However, if someone immunized, but with a viral load, emits aerosols in front of someone who does not have the same defenses, they can infect it. If the other person is immunized, the ability for the disease to spread is minimal.\"  \n>  \n>For this reason, the UPO biologist points out the importance of maintaining common preventive measures until vaccination is general. That reality will change, as L\u00f3pez Lluch warns, the faster it is vaccinated and the greater its scope. \"As long as herd immunity is not achieved,\" concludes the specialist, \"mutations that confer greater infectivity to the virus will have a greater capacity to spread to more people.\"  \n>  \n>The fast-spreading variants of the coronavirus carry mutations that allow it to escape part of the immune response created naturally or through vaccination, according to a new study published in Science by scientists from the US, Germany and the Netherlands. The researchers mainly focused on three mutations: K417N, E484K, and N501Y. Alone or in combination, they are found in most major SARS-CoV-2 variants and affect the spicule, the pathogen's gateway to the human cell. The scientists determined that some antibodies lose the ability to effectively neutralize the virus when mutations are present.  \n>  \n>**Reinfections**  \n>  \n>The importance of mass vaccination that includes all age groups against reinfections is also supported by neurologist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine (USA) Seth M. Glickenhaus, lead author of a study on reinfection in young people published in The Lancet:\u201cOur findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 reinfection occurs in young adults. Despite a previous infection, young people can contract the virus again and can still transmit it to others. This is an important point to know and remember as vaccine rollouts continue. Young people should receive the vaccine whenever possible, as vaccination is necessary to increase immune responses, prevent reinfection, and reduce transmission.\"  \n>  \n>The study shows, according to the authors, that antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection are largely protective, but do not completely protect against reinfection in young people. The study tracked more than 3,249 members of the United States Marine Corps ( Marine Corps) between May and November 2020. About 10% (19 of 189) of participants who had previously had the disease were reinfected. . The research found that those without immunity had five times the risk of infection than participants with antibodies, but the latter still had some risk of reinfection.",

              "body": "AstraZeneca's under-fire COVID-19 vaccine has been dealt another blow, with confirmation it simply doesn't work at preventing mild-to-moderate infections caused by the South African variant of the virus. \n\nSouth Africa halted its planned rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine in early February, when evidence emerged it might not be effective against a local mutated version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, called 501.V2 or B.1.351.\n\nThe variant has a number of mutations on its spike protein - the pointy bit the virus uses to enter human cells - which make it more infectious. \n\nThe decision to halt the rollout of the vaccine - also known as ChAdOx1 nCoV19 - was made based on early data from a study by scientists at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. The full details of that research have now been peer-reviewed, and were published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIn the study, 750 people got two shots of the AstraZeneca vaccine and 717 a placebo. Of those who got the vaccine, 19 went on to develop \"mild-to-moderate\" COVID-19, compared with 23 in the placebo group. Of the 42 COVID-19 cases, 39 were the B.1.351 variant.\n\nAll-up, this gave it an efficacy of just 10.4 percent.\n\n\"A two-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1 nCoV19 vaccine did not show protection against mild-to-moderate COVID-19 due to the B.1.351 variant,\" the study concluded. \n\nIn contrast, rival vaccines such as those made by Pfizer and Moderna have shown more than 90 percent efficacy against the original strain of the virus, though there are ongoing concerns they too might not work as well against B.1.351. \n\nWhile studies have found the AstraZeneca vaccine - like the others - is effective at preventing severe illness and death, a mysterious condition known as 'long COVID' is possible even after mild infections. People showing symptoms are also believed to be more infectious than those who catch the virus but don't get sick, potentially putting more people at risk.\n\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine, developed in conjunction with the University of Oxford, has had a troubled development. Mistakes were made in its trial phase, which led to some volunteers getting injected with the wrong amount; its effectiveness during its trials wasn't quite as good as that achieved by vaccines made by some of its rivals; and there have been recent reports it could be causing blood clots, prompting several countries to stop using it.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has urged countries to keep using it, saying there's no evidence linking use of the vaccine to blood clots, and even if there was, current data suggests the risk is still extremely low compared to that posed by COVID-19. \n\nChAdOx1 nCoV19 is cheaper to produce and easier to transport and store than some of the other vaccines developed so far, making it a key weapon in the WHO's arsenal against COVID-19, particularly in poorer countries. \n\nMost vaccine manufacturers expect they'll need to make booster shots as new variants of the virus emerge, but they won't be available for months, at least. Some medical experts have predicted COVID-19 will become endemic like influenza - another disease that is here to stay, constantly mutating to evade existing vaccines. \n\nIts deadlier predecessor SARS was wiped out after killing less than 1000 people because it wasn't as infectious as SARS-CoV-2.",

You took that statement out of context. The neighborhood mentioned was THE hardest hit in all of NYC, so to have those from out of the community fill up the appointment slots meant for those within the community shows that there are (and this is where you are correct), gaps in the process that need to be improved. In the meantime, this is what has happened as a result: the community, which is mostly Latino, is missing out on vaccines intended to help this particularly intensely hit community, and those who aren\u2019t in the community (mostly White folks) are coming in to take those vaccines. \n\nNow, obviously the process needs tweaking, and this article merely points that out. It most certainly isn\u2019t race baiting to point out where the facts are. It is NO SECRET that COVID-19 has u disproportionately affected more minority groups than can be explained by genetics alone. We, as a society, need to balance that out. The socio-economic factors are complex but they are obvious. If minorities are being affected in greater numbers than their percentage of our whole, it is something we ALL would do well to pause and rectify.",

In July, Sinopharm initiated phase 3 trials for its two vaccine candidates in the United Arab Emirates; one of the vaccines also began trials in Morocco and Peru in August, according to the New York Times vaccine tracker. Sinovac launched CoronaVac\u2019s phase 3 trials in July in Brazil, followed by Indonesia the following month.

It's a tough moral decision, but Covid is still killing 6,000 people worldwide every day (just from reported numbers), so fast-tracking a vaccine for this isn't without merit. But this also means large percentages of people won't be taking the early vaccine because they feel it's not safe and they don't need it. One needs to keep in mind Covid is also not as politicized in most of the world as it is in the US.

It just reduces the efficacy of some, and all the vaccines we have still prevent serious illness, death and hospitalization. And as I explained, even if that mutation starts to pop up on established variants it will take quite a long time to become dominant due to evolutionary norms and competition. Just because one car model gets an upgrade doesnt mean all the same existing models get it at the same time\n\nPfizer has stated they could have a modified vaccine within 100 days (including testing and design) that is significantly faster than it would take for any one variant or mutation to become dominant. The *worst* case scenario is that as partially resistant variants become dominant we will have vaccines around the same time\n\nOn top of this you\u2019re statement that the pharmaceutical companies are not testing their vaccines against variants is untrue. Novavax & J&J have both trialed against the SA variant and found 100% efficacy preventing serious illness and death, and around 60% efficacy against symptomatic illness. Moderna and Pfizer both have laboratory dating demonstrating effectiveness, as the antibody levels generated against the SA variant was noticeably higher than ONE dose of the vaccine against the wild type, and we now know one dose confers around 85+% protection against symptomatic infection",

It would be rather disappointing to put it mildly to let something like this mutation make a big dent in the progress that has been made by the current vaccines.\n\nit looks like the best we can hope is this is the virus showing this is the best it can do so it won't make any significant changes beyond the variants already being documented now so vaccine makers can catch up.\n\nBTW e484k is also being found in Uganda variant that is now found in other countries like Israel https://www.jewishpress.com/news/health-and-medicine/coronavirus/covid-19-uganda-variant-identified-in-israel/2021/02/21/",

Well it's shown to have a significant effect in subduing the virus, that much is clear. Is it a total write off and a failure? That seems a bit of an overreach. I believe most people would still get it if it proves safe and ends up causing the virus to be more of a common cold than what it currently is.

Apparently the folks answering the phones last week had been getting tons of calls, as soon as the meeting dates were announced. So. Hopefully the pressure keeps up and things move faster.\n\nBut, yeah, totally commiserating here.

The ones in whom the virus has entered their system but developed no symptoms are referred to as asymptomatic, but they are counted as infected and factored into IFR. IFR is a statistical estimate and not a counted number, unlike CFR which is a counted number. CFR varies widely depending on the healthcare system and its various aspects and parts and is not an indicator of the disease itself, but of the disease and of the healthcare system.\n\nIndividuals being \"susceptible\" or not does not enter either calculation, it seems. Either you were infected or you were not.\n\nThere is the point of minimum feasible viral load, which they seem to have not figured out yet (i.e. 1,234 viruses in one place), but they decide that it should be one number for everyone.\n\nThere is another omission in my earlier post, which is that herd immunity confers a good deal of protection to everyone not infected, and herd immunity is (R0 - 1)/R0 % of a given population, which means for a globalised world it would be, assuming R0=3, 67% of 7 billion which is about 4.67 billion people. In practice, it might be much lower. R reduces drastically if you take steps like masks (big one), staying at home(big one), social distancing, temporary lockdowns, etc. Therefore, say with an R of 1.5, you would get herd immunity at 33% infected (presymptomatic, asymptomatic or symptomatic).\n\nThe point I was making was that IFR may be <= 0.5% but potentially everyone is vulnerable to getting infected if we do not distance, which means a small percentage of a big number is still a pretty big number and therefore everyone is taking it seriously.\n\n----\n\nNow, in this post, I would like to add that the virus obviously seems to affect the rich, the poor and the powerful equally and therefore, human power structures have begun to respect it, unlike in the case of cold and flu. Nobody shuts down schools for the flu or for tuberculosis or malaria, even though poor people die in the 100s of 1000s annually from those diseases, but most of them are poor and/or don't matter.",

Before, we were supposed to be already in quarantine (over a month in my city) but you could go out and see people just walking around, running, biking, lots of crowded places... and nobody even checked if you had the permit to go out. A complete joke.\nNow that control seems to be more strict, I hope our numbers start to go down, but at this point they still get people arrested for organizing parties, football matches, etc. \nIt seems that young people (20-39 years old) believe that, since most of the elderly already got their two shots of vaccine, the pandemic is over, and it also didn't help that in the beginning our government put special enphasis on the elderly and sick being at risk (young people felt like they wouldn't catch the virus).",

For N95, yes they need to be sealed, but we're not talking about that, and isn't necessary for daily living. Anything to filter your breath causes a significant reduction in transmission.

We know that vaccines reduce transmission by significant, almost overwhelming margins \n\n2. Even against some of the most problematic variants, we know that vaccines retain respectable evidence. The manufacturers of states this over, and over, and over again \n\n3. The goal, as stated by US health officials is not to achieve a covid0 fantasy land but reduce transmission to low levels and stop severe illness\n\n4. B.1.1.7 accounts for close 90% of variant cases in Canada\u2019s most populous provinces, and we have overwhelming evidence that vaccines are highly effective against it, even vaccines with somewhat lower efficacy like AZ. \n\nI also hope that Dr. Howard Njoo knows that restrictions in Canada are entirely up to provinces, so him and the federal government have exactly 0 power when it comes to these things. In the latter parts of 2020 health experts were claiming that a vaccine with 60% efficacy would be a silver bullet. Well, congratulations because w have far exceeded that goal by every possible metric. So while I am not a fan of this saying, Dr. Howard Njoo has in-fact moved the goal posts, and his statements are not supported by a sizeable amount of available evidence. It is also not the first tone deaf statement he\u2019s made on this subject. It\u2019s a good thing this guy has no real power, and even Canada\u2019s top doctor, Dr. Tam, who is quite pessimistic in her prognostications has made statements contradicting Howard Njoo.\n\nIn short, sometimes I am truly embarrassed by my government",

New Hampshire is 10th.\n\n>According to the AP data, full vaccination rates across the six New England states range from a high of 69.4% in Vermont to 61.5% in New Hampshire.\n\n>Despite the relatively high vaccination rates \u2014 the U.S. as a whole is averaging 55.5% \u2014 there are still hundreds of thousands of people across the region who, for one reason or another, remain unvaccinated and vulnerable to infection.\n\n>Now, a Rhode Island official said he didn\u2019t think the 70% vaccination goal, once touted as the level that would help end the pandemic in the state, is enough.\n\n>\u201dWhat we\u2019ve learned with delta and looking beyond delta, is because that\u2019s where our focus is as well, to really reach those levels of vaccination, to give you that true population level protection, you need to be in excess of 90%,\u201d said Tom McCarthy, the executive director of the Rhode Island Department of Health\n\nEdit to add the beginning of the article.",

Vaccine acceptance seems pretty flat across ages, except at the upper end where it's significantly higher. But African-American acceptance of a potential COVID vaccine is substantially lower than other racial or ethnic groups, by some 30-40 points, even though they have suffered disproportionately from the pandemic. There is a history of medical distrust, with a number of real-world incidents like Tuskegee feeding into it. If the feeling is that they might be taken advantage of, having successful African-American athletes publicly take the vaccine might actually move the needle (not pun intended) a significant degree. Also, there are less than 500 NBA players total. That's less doses than have had to be discarded multiple times due to minor handling issues. From a functional standpoint, it's a drop in the bucket in terms of supply and could possible greatly increase vaccine uptake in disadvantaged communities.

Does it make sense to divert from the effort to vaccinate the country with the most cases and deaths in the world? Because any sharing at this point would slow rollout in the US. \n\nPeople seem to have this idea that new variants and mutations can only spring up in the developing world... which is demonstrably false. The US, which still has the world's highest case numbers is very likely to spawn new mutations.\n\nIf the goal is to get a shot into every arm in the world, then it doesn't really matter WHERE that arm is... better to knock out the disease first in the region that will be most capable of supplying the world once back at full economic capacity.",

Assume R of a semi-opened society is = 2\n\nOn one hand, #1 above is better, because the 80 year old has a much higher risk of death.  On the other hand #2 above is better, because  each marginal vax'd person in this age group is close to the inflection point where each incremental dose toward herd immunity effects can make an outsized impact in the society that they live in.\n\nThis is kind of where we see ourselves in the UK and USA right now.  We're about 2 months of full-tilt vax'ing away from beating covid spread down to dwindling isolated pockets.\n\nSometimes equity and efficacy are the same policy.  Sometimes not.  You can think of the complex intractable math, but there's a a simpler thought experiment.  There is a herd threshold of beating down the disease.  What works fastest to get across that 60% vax'd line that Israel did to beat down the disease and have some sense of normalcy?  Boil the ocean or boil one pot at a time?",

The problem is, once you shut everything down, it's very hard to reopen it again. In 14 days time, everything, everywhere will be substantially worse than it is today. So you can't say \"problem solved, everyone it's safe to go out again!'. And then you have to keep it closed for even longer. Problem is, it could be many, many months until it's safer than the day you shut it down.\n2. It doesn't take much time in shutting a country down until the economy collapses, the money stops flowing, people starve, civil unrest, etc. etc. But before you get to that stage, you have to remember that hospitals, treatment, research, oxygen, ECMO machines, vaccines, and simpler things like electricity and water require tax and MONEY TO FLOW to keep working. Each country will have money in reserve for emergencies, but it will run out very quickly. Yes the virus is moving fast, but not that fast, kind of fast and slow at the same time. It's not going to burn through the world population in the next couple of weeks. It's going to be 6 months plus for that to happen. So I think countries have to be prepared to shut everything down, but at the same time leave it to the very last minute, in order to make sure there's enough money to pay for the stuff for the final end game.

This is a well known feature of viruses, and it is why virologists warned against NERTAG overinterpreting epidemiological data as evidence that B.1.1.7 was more infectious. \n\nThe November/December surge seen across Europe is mostly due to seasonality.",

This virus spike protein hooks onto the human cell via a \u201creceptor\u201d to gain entry into the cells: this is how infection starts. The virus then starts multiplying inside cells. It ultimately gets released by the cells and can go on to infect more cells.\n\n>The changes in the spike protein of 501Y.V2 are likely to enhance its binding with human cell receptors, allowing easier infection and greater replication within the host. This may result in greater amounts of virus in an infected person, who can then infect other people more easily. The ultimate result could be quicker spread among people.\n\n>Scientists have observed that 501Y.V2 has quickly become \u201cdominant\u201d among multiple variants that have been circulating in the South African population. This strongly suggests the new mutations of this variant offer a transmission advantage. In some regions of South Africa, more than 80% of viruses currently isolated from infected people are now 501Y.V2.\n\n>This is likely to mean that most people who are now infected have a coronavirus that is more easily transmissible.\n\n.....",

My comment was directed to the idiotic logic of the original poster that if the virus mutates such that the vaccine no longer works that the virus must therefore not be capable of hurting us anymore.  These UK and South Africa variants seem to make it more transmissible and equally severe and I'm not sure they know how the vaccine works with those variants but I have seen initial reports of the vaccines being less effective versus those variants.",

The \"public domain\" study I believe he's citing (which showed a greater than 40 percent reduction in neutralization activity for the South African variant) concerned convalescent sera samples in a lab setting - the study had nothing to do with vaccines.\n\nRight around the same time (AKA, a few days ago), an additional preprint was released that tested vaccinated sera against the most concerning mutations in the new variants (i.e. E484K) and found a \"small but significant\" decrease in neutralization. Not the full story just yet, but a good omen that we're not looking at an escape scenario - and probably nowhere near a 50% decrease in efficacy. \n\nVaccinated sera confers robust immunity - far more than just monoclonal antibodies. For one, neutralizing titers are typically much higher, creating a cushion effect for diminished efficacy. And in a clinical (non lab) setting, other elements of immunity (t-cells, etc.) will play a role as well (one that is significant but not fully understood). Even if infection is still possible in some vaccinated subjects, it could be the case that illness isn't serious, with the immune system correcting its antibody response to match new variants quicker than if it was beginning from scratch.\n\nFurther data will confirm, but I really do feel Hancock simply misspoke. There's no private data he's referencing for those worried - he even says the information is \"public domain\" and unverified (re: pre-print), which is why he \u201cwouldn't make such a statement publicly\u201d.\n\nAs for the studies I'm referring to - they\u2019ve been posted numerous times here and on the /r/covid19 sister subreddit. I'd cite them but I don't have time to look at the moment. If someone has them on hand, it might be worth linking to them.",
