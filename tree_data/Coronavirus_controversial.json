            "body": ">**Those immunized can spread the virus if their body's defenses are not as efficient as possible, according to several studies.**  \n>  \n>The registry of infections of people who have passed the covid or who are vaccinated is scarce. But they are given and they are a wake-up call: it is still too early for the open bar, for the return to absolute normality. Different studies have detected infections between 10% and less than 1% of people already immunized, depending on the moment, the group, the place of the investigation and the vaccination schedule. These people, asymptomatic in most cases thanks to natural or vaccine-induced immunity, still retain the ability to harbor and spread the coronavirus for a time, even if they do not develop the disease. According to Guillermo L\u00f3pez Lluch, professor of Cell Biology at the Pablo de Olavide University (UPO), the key to avoiding the danger of contagion being promoted, is \"to achieve the broadest possible group immunity in the shortest period of time.\" \"It is a race against the virus,\" he warns.  \n>  \n>The biologist has been able to verify an infection of an immunized person in a close case: a person close to him, 92 years old and vaccinated with the double dose of one of the brands administered in Spain, had to enter a trauma hospital in Cordova. He was routinely tested for covid and tested positive, despite lacking symptoms consistent with the disease.  \n>  \n>Jocelyn Keehner and Lucy E. Horton, along with other members of the University of California (UCLA) and San Diego (UCSD) Faculties of Medicine, published last March in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) the results of an internal investigation: \u201cThe absolute risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 \\[coronavirus that causes covid\\] after vaccination was 1.19% among UCSD healthcare workers and 0.97 % among those from UCLA; these rates are higher than the risks reported in the trials of the coronavirus vaccine mRNA-12731 \\[Moderna\\] and the vaccine BNT162b2.2 \\[Pfizer-BioNTech\\].\u201d The study shows the same conclusions, although with different figures, as another published last month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States and other previous ones reflected in Nature and the British Medical Journal.  \n>  \n>All these studies confirm the existence of infections in immunized patients, although their record is scarce. L\u00f3pez Lluch explains one reason: \u201cIt is very likely that the cases are more numerous than those detected, since, in most cases, they do not produce symptoms and, therefore, these people, who are considered immunized, are not makes them PCR \u201d. Mark Pandori, director of the Nevada Public Health Laboratory, agrees. \u201cWe are underestimating the cases of reinfection. They are very difficult to determine, you need specialized equipment to do that work or a central laboratory, \"he explains in Scientific American.  \n>  \n>L\u00f3pez Lluch refers to a recent study in The Lancet to argue that, although the immune response generated by vaccination or by the body itself prevents contagion and suffering from the most serious consequences of covid, there are immunized people who become infected and can be a source of spread of the virus, even if they show little or no symptoms.  \n>  \n>The cell biology specialist explains that the cause is the viral load, the amount of virus that circulates in the blood of the infected person. Immunized people have a defense line made up of B and T lymphocytes. \u201cThe former produce antibodies, they hinder the virus from entering the cell. The latter attack it directly and generate intermediaries, such as interferon, the proteins that signal the presence of a virus and prevent its proliferation \u201d, he simplifies to explain it.  \n>  \n>But while this system works to eliminate the infection, a person, even if he does not develop the disease, can maintain a certain viral load. In this sense, L\u00f3pez Lluch explains: \u201cImmunity is a matter of days. While we are not immune, the virus or pathogen has a long time to cause damage that is reflected in the symptoms, which are more serious. Our body's defenses are inefficient and take time, between 10 and 14 days, to fully activate. When we are immune, the response of B and T lymphocytes is faster and the pathogen has less time to cause damage. However, if someone immunized, but with a viral load, emits aerosols in front of someone who does not have the same defenses, they can infect it. If the other person is immunized, the ability for the disease to spread is minimal.\"  \n>  \n>For this reason, the UPO biologist points out the importance of maintaining common preventive measures until vaccination is general. That reality will change, as L\u00f3pez Lluch warns, the faster it is vaccinated and the greater its scope. \"As long as herd immunity is not achieved,\" concludes the specialist, \"mutations that confer greater infectivity to the virus will have a greater capacity to spread to more people.\"  \n>  \n>The fast-spreading variants of the coronavirus carry mutations that allow it to escape part of the immune response created naturally or through vaccination, according to a new study published in Science by scientists from the US, Germany and the Netherlands. The researchers mainly focused on three mutations: K417N, E484K, and N501Y. Alone or in combination, they are found in most major SARS-CoV-2 variants and affect the spicule, the pathogen's gateway to the human cell. The scientists determined that some antibodies lose the ability to effectively neutralize the virus when mutations are present.  \n>  \n>**Reinfections**  \n>  \n>The importance of mass vaccination that includes all age groups against reinfections is also supported by neurologist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine (USA) Seth M. Glickenhaus, lead author of a study on reinfection in young people published in The Lancet:\u201cOur findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 reinfection occurs in young adults. Despite a previous infection, young people can contract the virus again and can still transmit it to others. This is an important point to know and remember as vaccine rollouts continue. Young people should receive the vaccine whenever possible, as vaccination is necessary to increase immune responses, prevent reinfection, and reduce transmission.\"  \n>  \n>The study shows, according to the authors, that antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection are largely protective, but do not completely protect against reinfection in young people. The study tracked more than 3,249 members of the United States Marine Corps ( Marine Corps) between May and November 2020. About 10% (19 of 189) of participants who had previously had the disease were reinfected. . The research found that those without immunity had five times the risk of infection than participants with antibodies, but the latter still had some risk of reinfection.",

So you can't say \"problem solved, everyone it's safe to go out again!'. And then you have to keep it closed for even longer. Problem is, it could be many, many months until it's safer than the day you shut it down.\n2. It doesn't take much time in shutting a country down until the economy collapses, the money stops flowing, people starve, civil unrest, etc. etc. But before you get to that stage, you have to remember that hospitals, treatment, research, oxygen, ECMO machines, vaccines, and simpler things like electricity and water require tax and MONEY TO FLOW to keep working. Each country will have money in reserve for emergencies, but it will run out very quickly. Yes the virus is moving fast, but not that fast, kind of fast and slow at the same time. It's not going to burn through the world population in the next couple of weeks. It's going to be 6 months plus for that to happen. So I think countries have to be prepared to shut everything down, but at the same time leave it to the very last minute, in order to make sure there's enough money to pay for the stuff for the final end game.

The only people allowed out could be (previously tested) military personnel. \nIn theory this thing should be over with in 2 weeks time.\nI know this would demand a lot of planning and coordinating and would probably cause an increase in deaths by the currently infected - but I argue that this would be smarter than the half hearted effort we are doing now, which probably has to last until there is a vaccine - meaning 1 year!\nSo even if in those 2 weeks 1.500 people die (half of the infected population outside of China). It would be much lower than what we probably going to see in a year from now.\nYou thoughts?"

Well it's shown to have a significant effect in subduing the virus, that much is clear. Is it a total write off and a failure? That seems a bit of an overreach.

It just reduces the efficacy of some, and all the vaccines we have still prevent serious illness, death and hospitalization. And as I explained, even if that mutation starts to pop up on established variants it will take quite a long time to become dominant due to evolutionary norms and competition. Just because one car model gets an upgrade doesnt mean all the same existing models get it at the same time\n\nPfizer has stated they could have a modified vaccine within 100 days (including testing and design) that is significantly faster than it would take for any one variant or mutation to become dominant. The *worst* case scenario is that as partially resistant variants become dominant we will have vaccines around the same time\n\nOn top of this you\u2019re statement that the pharmaceutical companies are not testing their vaccines against variants is untrue. Novavax & J&J have both trialed against the SA variant and found 100% efficacy preventing serious illness and death, and around 60% efficacy against symptomatic illness. Moderna and Pfizer both have laboratory dating demonstrating effectiveness, as the antibody levels generated against the SA variant was noticeably higher than ONE dose of the vaccine against the wild type, and we now know one dose confers around 85+% protection against symptomatic infection",

It would be rather disappointing to put it mildly to let something like this mutation make a big dent in the progress that has been made by the current vaccines.\n\nit looks like the best we can hope is this is the virus showing this is the best it can do so it won't make any significant changes beyond the variants already being documented now so vaccine makers can catch up.\n\nBTW e484k is also being found in Uganda variant that is now found in other countries like Israel https://www.jewishpress.com/news/health-and-medicine/coronavirus/covid-19-uganda-variant-identified-in-israel/2021/02/21/",

At the end of the day, unless you have a condition that makes taking the vaccine a hazard to your health (based on real science and not bullshit pseudoscience or misinformation) then remaining unvaccinated is an extremely selfish and shortsighted decision. I will admit that a lack in quality of public education is a massive contributor to folks\u2019 inability to properly evaluate news sources, but at this point the pandemic is so rampant and correct information is so easy to track down that I think it comes from an intersection of distrust (which I can appreciate but only from a certain perspective) and laziness",

That is relatively simple, but remember the virus can take 10-14 days between infection and symptoms. So potentially, you could have an exposure during your one week study and not see a second degree case until almost a month later. So at a minimum you are looking at 5 weeks of JUST data collection.\n\nNow you have to look at the data. Can you conclusively say that person A transmitted to person B? Only if everything is properly contact traced and genetically sequenced. That is not easy and can take time to contact everyone and piece together the timeline, especially with high rates of the virus in the general population and asymptomatic infection. \n\nWhen you are developing a product, you have to focus on certain things. Usually, baseline performance and safety are two of those. Smaller details get pushed to the side until resources become available. Mask mandates wouldn't go away until a significant portion of the population is vaccinate anyway, so why rush the data to help make that decision? You really want to make sure you get it right.\n\nThere are so many more factors to this, but this vaccine is \"scientifically\" approved because they properly applied the scientific method to prove its safety and efficacy. The data they currently have( and what you are proposing) does not meet the definition of \"good science\", so it wouldn't be approved by anyone in the community. For good reason.",

Until there's certainty, the whole point is to continue wearing masks until everyone/a greater proportion of your personal network (family/friends/coworkers) is vaccinated. \n\n>Will the COVID vaccine prevent me from infecting others?\n\n>The answer is, we don't know. Clinical trials of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines found that both do a good job preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease, including severe COVID-19. However, the trials did not measure whether a person who is vaccinated is less likely to spread the virus to someone else.\n\n>It's possible that the vaccines protect against COVID-19 disease by preventing a person from becoming infected in the first place. However, it's also possible that the vaccine protects a person from COVID-19 illness, but does not prevent a person from becoming infected. In other words, a vaccinated person may have replicating virus in their nose and throat even if they are protected from becoming sick.\n\n>But does that mean that you have enough virus in your nose and throat to infect someone else? Not necessarily. It's possible that the immune response triggered by the vaccine, which protects you from becoming sick, also reduces the amount of virus in your nose and throat to a point where you are unlikely to spread it to someone else. But we need more research to know for sure.\n\n>The bottom line? If you're among the first groups of people to get vaccinated, it's best to continue wearing masks and maintaining physical distance in order to protect others who haven't yet gotten the vaccine.\n\n[https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus#:~:text=The%20answer%20is%2C%20we,protected%20from%20becoming%20sick](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus#:~:text=The%20answer%20is%2C%20we,protected%20from%20becoming%20sick.)",

The ones in whom the virus has entered their system but developed no symptoms are referred to as asymptomatic, but they are counted as infected and factored into IFR. IFR is a statistical estimate and not a counted number, unlike CFR which is a counted number. CFR varies widely depending on the healthcare system and its various aspects and parts and is not an indicator of the disease itself, but of the disease and of the healthcare system.\n\nIndividuals being \"susceptible\" or not does not enter either calculation, it seems. Either you were infected or you were not.\n\nThere is the point of minimum feasible viral load, which they seem to have not figured out yet (i.e. 1,234 viruses in one place), but they decide that it should be one number for everyone.\n\nThere is another omission in my earlier post, which is that herd immunity confers a good deal of protection to everyone not infected, and herd immunity is (R0 - 1)/R0 % of a given population, which means for a globalised world it would be, assuming R0=3, 67% of 7 billion which is about 4.67 billion people. In practice, it might be much lower. R reduces drastically if you take steps like masks (big one), staying at home(big one), social distancing, temporary lockdowns, etc. Therefore, say with an R of 1.5, you would get herd immunity at 33% infected (presymptomatic, asymptomatic or symptomatic).\n\nThe point I was making was that IFR may be <= 0.5% but potentially everyone is vulnerable to getting infected if we do not distance, which means a small percentage of a big number is still a pretty big number and therefore everyone is taking it seriously.\n\n----\n\nNow, in this post, I would like to add that the virus obviously seems to affect the rich, the poor and the powerful equally and therefore, human power structures have begun to respect it, unlike in the case of cold and flu. Nobody shuts down schools for the flu or for tuberculosis or malaria, even though poor people die in the 100s of 1000s annually from those diseases, but most of them are poor and/or don't matter.",

Although reaching 100% coverage is nigh impossible. But if the extended dosing regiment puts Oxford/AZ efficacy anywhere near 70%, 75% coverage seems realistic.\n\n>Simulation experiments revealed that to prevent an epidemic (reduce the  peak by >99%), the vaccine efficacy has to be at least 60% when  vaccination coverage is 100% (reproduction number=2.5\u20133.5). This vaccine  efficacy threshold rises to 70% when coverage drops to 75% and up to  80% when coverage drops to 60% when reproduction number is 2.5, rising  to 80% when coverage drops to 75% when the reproduction number is 3.5.\n\n[Vaccine Efficacy Needed for a COVID-19 Coronavirus Vaccine to Prevent or Stop an Epidemic as the Sole Intervention](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7361120/)",

This virus spike protein hooks onto the human cell via a \u201creceptor\u201d to gain entry into the cells: this is how infection starts. The virus then starts multiplying inside cells. It ultimately gets released by the cells and can go on to infect more cells.\n\n>The changes in the spike protein of 501Y.V2 are likely to enhance its binding with human cell receptors, allowing easier infection and greater replication within the host. This may result in greater amounts of virus in an infected person, who can then infect other people more easily. The ultimate result could be quicker spread among people.\n\n>Scientists have observed that 501Y.V2 has quickly become \u201cdominant\u201d among multiple variants that have been circulating in the South African population. This strongly suggests the new mutations of this variant offer a transmission advantage. In some regions of South Africa, more than 80% of viruses currently isolated from infected people are now 501Y.V2.\n\n>This is likely to mean that most people who are now infected have a coronavirus that is more easily transmissible.\n\n.....",

My comment was directed to the idiotic logic of the original poster that if the virus mutates such that the vaccine no longer works that the virus must therefore not be capable of hurting us anymore.

                        "body": "Eh, technically yes, but the deeper issue here seems to be that Matt Hancock misspoke. The \"public domain\" study I believe he's citing (which showed a greater than 40 percent reduction in neutralization activity for the South African variant) concerned convalescent sera samples in a lab setting - the study had nothing to do with vaccines.\n\nRight around the same time (AKA, a few days ago), an additional preprint was released that tested vaccinated sera against the most concerning mutations in the new variants (i.e. E484K) and found a \"small but significant\" decrease in neutralization. Not the full story just yet, but a good omen that we're not looking at an escape scenario - and probably nowhere near a 50% decrease in efficacy. \n\nVaccinated sera confers robust immunity - far more than just monoclonal antibodies. For one, neutralizing titers are typically much higher, creating a cushion effect for diminished efficacy. And in a clinical (non lab) setting, other elements of immunity (t-cells, etc.) will play a role as well (one that is significant but not fully understood). Even if infection is still possible in some vaccinated subjects, it could be the case that illness isn't serious, with the immune system correcting its antibody response to match new variants quicker than if it was beginning from scratch.\n\nFurther data will confirm, but I really do feel Hancock simply misspoke. There's no private data he's referencing for those worried - he even says the information is \"public domain\" and unverified (re: pre-print), which is why he \u201cwouldn't make such a statement publicly\u201d.\n\nAs for the studies I'm referring to - they\u2019ve been posted numerous times here and on the /r/covid19 sister subreddit. I'd cite them but I don't have time to look at the moment. If someone has them on hand, it might be worth linking to them.",

The title is setting realistic expectations for the future that the public NEEDS to understand and are substantiated by infectious disease experts. Nowhere do they say that quarantine is going to be the status quo forever, but like most infectious diseases, it's not just going to disappear and we, as a society, will have to adjust to that, both short and long-term. \n\nIf your response to this is \"fuck-it,\" then I encourage you to take a little time to reflect. Yes, it's scary to think about the long-term implications and that things might not go back to \"normal\" as we knew it anytime soon. It sucks and no one is denying it. \n\nBut we as a society will have to adapt and the sooner we can accept that and unite in doing so, the better.",

They said Remdesivir is a vaccine, but it isnt it is an: after its already infected you treatment. It prevents nothing. So all this hype about vaccines being the savior is only so relevant when you look at the science behind it. Most will only have moderate effectiveness (according to Fauci), and he would be happy with one that was 70% effective as it would end the pandemic, but at the same time if any 10 that would die from it now, that would still leave 3 dead, which is only so good imo.\n\nNot to be all gloom and what not, but this is speculation, the common cold, another coronavirus has yet to be eradicated and that has been around for as long as we have human records. So the fastest way is to social distance and mask up, and for governments to be serious about punishing those who dont, that way the spread is so minimal that it is not as much a threat to the hospital system being overloaded. As we have seen, the longer time goes on with our medical professionals dealing with this, the better the survival rates get. So long as they arent overloaded the death rates stay relatively low, Texas, Arizona, Florida are a perfect example. Mitigating how many people end up in the hospital and the ability of the hospital to keep its workers safe (so the experienced skilled ones dont catch the virus and be taken off the front lines). Those are the fastest ways. Depending on some possibility that has evidence supporting the opposite is just against reason.",

Sinovac launched CoronaVac\u2019s phase 3 trials in July in Brazil, followed by Indonesia the following month.

Countries are going to have to weigh saving lives by going early with vaccines that haven't completely gone through the normal Phase III trials, and the possibility there are serious side effects. It's a tough moral decision, but Covid is still killing 6,000 people worldwide every day (just from reported numbers), so fast-tracking a vaccine for this isn't without merit. But this also means large percentages of people won't be taking the early vaccine because they feel it's not safe and they don't need it. One needs to keep in mind Covid is also not as politicized in most of the world as it is in the US. People in vulnerable populations (elderly, immuno-compromised) probably would weigh the odds, and likely come to the conclusion they are improving their chances by taking the early vaccine.",

The neighborhood mentioned was THE hardest hit in all of NYC, so to have those from out of the community fill up the appointment slots meant for those within the community shows that there are (and this is where you are correct), gaps in the process that need to be improved. In the meantime, this is what has happened as a result: the community, which is mostly Latino, is missing out on vaccines intended to help this particularly intensely hit community, and those who aren\u2019t in the community (mostly White folks) are coming in to take those vaccines. \n\nNow, obviously the process needs tweaking, and this article merely points that out. It most certainly isn\u2019t race baiting to point out where the facts are. It is NO SECRET that COVID-19 has u disproportionately affected more minority groups than can be explained by genetics alone. We, as a society, need to balance that out. The socio-economic factors are complex but they are obvious. If minorities are being affected in greater numbers than their percentage of our whole, it is something we ALL would do well to pause and rectify.",

Israel has already given us preliminary evidence of this. \n\nThe main goal and benefit of this vaccine will be prevention of severe cases; hospitalization and deaths in vulnerable groups \n\nAlmost no country will see a 95% 'net' efficacy in terms of reduction in infection (apart from the ones with close to zero community transmission) most will see substantially lower. \n\nWhy? Because the 95% number taken from clinical trials **only starts counting from 7 days post dose 2. It ignores all infections within the last 28 days**\n\nAnd of course,  this timeframe was when most infections occured in the trial !! (39/50 in the first 21 days alone) The vaccine doesn't even fully kick in till 12 days post vaccination. Infections didn't appreciably deviate from placebo until then you can see this right there in the cumulative incidence data\n\nTherefore only way countries like US will see 95% efficacy is of they test like the clinical trial did--  **ignore any infections occuring in people that have been vaccinated in the past month**. Oh and they'd also have to not test anyone who's been vaccinated *at any point* if they're not exhibiting symptoms because pfizer trial only tested those with symptoms. Which made the efficacy against infection appear artificially high. \n\nThey'd also have to advise anyone who has symptoms correlating with vaccine reactogenicity within 7 days of administration (ie headache, fatigue) to not seek out testing unless it was certainly likely to be covid (loss of smell etc) this would reduce positivity further, and is exactly how the trial operated.\n\nIn short: While efficacy may be 95% measured in the vaccines cohorts weeks after their second dose, (vaccine will offer strong protection from that point) that doesn't prevent the demographic from getting infected starting from day 0 which is how we're operating in the real world.\n\n \"True\" real world efficacy in terms of observable real time impact on cases is not going to be close to the 95% figure, it was never possible in any country that has high spread.  And therefore articles like this one start from a false premise that vaccinated \"only\" have a 5% chance of infection, they also seem to confuse immune response here in the article.. \n\neven if 99% of people mount an immune response that doesn't necessarily mean only 1% will be infected..",

Vaccine acceptance seems pretty flat across ages, except at the upper end where it's significantly higher. But African-American acceptance of a potential COVID vaccine is substantially lower than other racial or ethnic groups, by some 30-40 points, even though they have suffered disproportionately from the pandemic. There is a history of medical distrust, with a number of real-world incidents like Tuskegee feeding into it. If the feeling is that they might be taken advantage of, having successful African-American athletes publicly take the vaccine might actually move the needle (not pun intended) a significant degree. Also, there are less than 500 NBA players total. That's less doses than have had to be discarded multiple times due to minor handling issues. From a functional standpoint, it's a drop in the bucket in terms of supply and could possible greatly increase vaccine uptake in disadvantaged communities. I think that substantially outweighs any \"fairness\" issues.\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30239-X/fulltext\n\nhttps://www.kff.org/policy-watch/racial-disparities-flu-vaccination-implications-covid-19-vaccination-efforts/\n\nhttps://theconversation.com/whats-not-being-said-about-why-african-americans-need-to-take-the-covid-19-vaccine-152323\n\nAlso, the shot at KAJ as nothing more than a \"former NBA player\" does a pretty large disservice to his post-playing career.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar",

            "body": "AstraZeneca's under-fire COVID-19 vaccine has been dealt another blow, with confirmation it simply doesn't work at preventing mild-to-moderate infections caused by the South African variant of the virus. \n\nSouth Africa halted its planned rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine in early February, when evidence emerged it might not be effective against a local mutated version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, called 501.V2 or B.1.351.\n\nThe variant has a number of mutations on its spike protein - the pointy bit the virus uses to enter human cells - which make it more infectious. \n\nThe decision to halt the rollout of the vaccine - also known as ChAdOx1 nCoV19 - was made based on early data from a study by scientists at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. The full details of that research have now been peer-reviewed, and were published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIn the study, 750 people got two shots of the AstraZeneca vaccine and 717 a placebo. Of those who got the vaccine, 19 went on to develop \"mild-to-moderate\" COVID-19, compared with 23 in the placebo group. Of the 42 COVID-19 cases, 39 were the B.1.351 variant.\n\nAll-up, this gave it an efficacy of just 10.4 percent.\n\n\"A two-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1 nCoV19 vaccine did not show protection against mild-to-moderate COVID-19 due to the B.1.351 variant,\" the study concluded. \n\nIn contrast, rival vaccines such as those made by Pfizer and Moderna have shown more than 90 percent efficacy against the original strain of the virus, though there are ongoing concerns they too might not work as well against B.1.351. \n\nWhile studies have found the AstraZeneca vaccine - like the others - is effective at preventing severe illness and death, a mysterious condition known as 'long COVID' is possible even after mild infections. People showing symptoms are also believed to be more infectious than those who catch the virus but don't get sick, potentially putting more people at risk.\n\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine, developed in conjunction with the University of Oxford, has had a troubled development. Mistakes were made in its trial phase, which led to some volunteers getting injected with the wrong amount; its effectiveness during its trials wasn't quite as good as that achieved by vaccines made by some of its rivals; and there have been recent reports it could be causing blood clots, prompting several countries to stop using it.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has urged countries to keep using it, saying there's no evidence linking use of the vaccine to blood clots, and even if there was, current data suggests the risk is still extremely low compared to that posed by COVID-19. \n\nChAdOx1 nCoV19 is cheaper to produce and easier to transport and store than some of the other vaccines developed so far, making it a key weapon in the WHO's arsenal against COVID-19, particularly in poorer countries. \n\nMost vaccine manufacturers expect they'll need to make booster shots as new variants of the virus emerge, but they won't be available for months, at least. Some medical experts have predicted COVID-19 will become endemic like influenza - another disease that is here to stay, constantly mutating to evade existing vaccines. \n\nIts deadlier predecessor SARS was wiped out after killing less than 1000 people because it wasn't as infectious as SARS-CoV-2.",

Even if we wanted to vaccinated 100% of the US population today, we simply can't YET. Does it make sense to divert from the effort to vaccinate the country with the most cases and deaths in the world? Because any sharing at this point would slow rollout in the US. \n\nPeople seem to have this idea that new variants and mutations can only spring up in the developing world... which is demonstrably false. The US, which still has the world's highest case numbers is very likely to spawn new mutations.\n\nIf the goal is to get a shot into every arm in the world, then it doesn't really matter WHERE that arm is... better to knock out the disease first in the region that will be most capable of supplying the world once back at full economic capacity.",

Assume R of a semi-opened society is = 2\n\nOn one hand, #1 above is better, because the 80 year old has a much higher risk of death.  On the other hand #2 above is better, because  each marginal vax'd person in this age group is close to the inflection point where each incremental dose toward herd immunity effects can make an outsized impact in the society that they live in.\n\nThis is kind of where we see ourselves in the UK and USA right now.  We're about 2 months of full-tilt vax'ing away from beating covid spread down to dwindling isolated pockets.\n\nSometimes equity and efficacy are the same policy.  Sometimes not.  You can think of the complex intractable math, but there's a a simpler thought experiment.  There is a herd threshold of beating down the disease.  What works fastest to get across that 60% vax'd line that Israel did to beat down the disease and have some sense of normalcy?  Boil the ocean or boil one pot at a time?",
