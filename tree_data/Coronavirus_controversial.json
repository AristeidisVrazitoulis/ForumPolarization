This virus spike protein hooks onto the human cell via a \u201creceptor\u201d to gain entry into the cells: this is how infection starts. The virus then starts multiplying inside cells. It ultimately gets released by the cells and can go on to infect more cells.\n\n>The changes in the spike protein of 501Y.V2 are likely to enhance its binding with human cell receptors, allowing easier infection and greater replication within the host. This may result in greater amounts of virus in an infected person, who can then infect other people more easily. The ultimate result could be quicker spread among people.\n\n>Scientists have observed that 501Y.V2 has quickly become \u201cdominant\u201d among multiple variants that have been circulating in the South African population. This strongly suggests the new mutations of this variant offer a transmission advantage. In some regions of South Africa, more than 80% of viruses currently isolated from infected people are now 501Y.V2.\n\n>This is likely to mean that most people who are now infected have a coronavirus that is more easily transmissible.\n\n.....",

My comment was directed to the idiotic logic of the original poster that if the virus mutates such that the vaccine no longer works that the virus must therefore not be capable of hurting us anymore.  These UK and South Africa variants seem to make it more transmissible and equally severe and I'm not sure they know how the vaccine works with those variants but I have seen initial reports of the vaccines being less effective versus those variants.",

The \"public domain\" study I believe he's citing (which showed a greater than 40 percent reduction in neutralization activity for the South African variant) concerned convalescent sera samples in a lab setting - the study had nothing to do with vaccines.\n\nRight around the same time (AKA, a few days ago), an additional preprint was released that tested vaccinated sera against the most concerning mutations in the new variants (i.e. E484K) and found a \"small but significant\" decrease in neutralization. Not the full story just yet, but a good omen that we're not looking at an escape scenario - and probably nowhere near a 50% decrease in efficacy. \n\nVaccinated sera confers robust immunity - far more than just monoclonal antibodies. For one, neutralizing titers are typically much higher, creating a cushion effect for diminished efficacy. And in a clinical (non lab) setting, other elements of immunity (t-cells, etc.) will play a role as well (one that is significant but not fully understood). Even if infection is still possible in some vaccinated subjects, it could be the case that illness isn't serious, with the immune system correcting its antibody response to match new variants quicker than if it was beginning from scratch.\n\nFurther data will confirm, but I really do feel Hancock simply misspoke. There's no private data he's referencing for those worried - he even says the information is \"public domain\" and unverified (re: pre-print), which is why he \u201cwouldn't make such a statement publicly\u201d.\n\nAs for the studies I'm referring to - they\u2019ve been posted numerous times here and on the /r/covid19 sister subreddit. I'd cite them but I don't have time to look at the moment. If someone has them on hand, it might be worth linking to them.",

His wasn\u2019t even a rare case; other coworkers tested positive for antibodies on the rapid tests from previous infections but when a count was taken they were really low.

Otherwise, people like you, who are far too jumpy to toss their masks and stop washing hands and pretend like life has gone back to normal for lack of patience will keep this shit spreading and we will have to stay in quarantine and mask usage even longer, because, as it turns out, you dont have to actually *contract* the virus to spread it, all you have to do is shake two peoples hands, it's not rocket science, despite what a lot of people try to make it out as.",

Those with compromised immune systems and the elderly are considered at higher risk of dying from COVID-19.\n> \n> Some doctors have suggested that Trudeau may already have the coronavirus but has no symptoms. Trudeau has not been tested for the virus, as most doctors recommend against testing people who are asymptomatic.\n> \n> In Camilla\u2019s case, Dr. Fish said it\u2019s possible that proper hygiene could\u2019ve played a role in her negative test results. However, she added that it\u2019s entirely possible that Camilla could test positive later.\n\nI think we're just disagreeing on semantics.\n\nFrom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection#Signs_and_symptoms :\n\n> In certain cases, infectious diseases may be asymptomatic for much or even all of their course in a given host. In the latter case, the disease may only be defined as a \"disease\" (which by definition means an illness) in hosts who secondarily become ill after contact with an asymptomatic carrier. **An infection is not synonymous with an infectious disease, as some infections do not cause illness in a host.** [17]\n\nAs i said, infection = virus entered your system in minimum viable amount. Developing symptoms depends on how your system interacts with the virus.",

The ones in whom the virus has entered their system but developed no symptoms are referred to as asymptomatic, but they are counted as infected and factored into IFR. IFR is a statistical estimate and not a counted number, unlike CFR which is a counted number. CFR varies widely depending on the healthcare system and its various aspects and parts and is not an indicator of the disease itself, but of the disease and of the healthcare system.\n\nIndividuals being \"susceptible\" or not does not enter either calculation, it seems. Either you were infected or you were not.\n\nThere is the point of minimum feasible viral load, which they seem to have not figured out yet (i.e. 1,234 viruses in one place), but they decide that it should be one number for everyone.\n\nThere is another omission in my earlier post, which is that herd immunity confers a good deal of protection to everyone not infected, and herd immunity is (R0 - 1)/R0 % of a given population, which means for a globalised world it would be, assuming R0=3, 67% of 7 billion which is about 4.67 billion people. In practice, it might be much lower. R reduces drastically if you take steps like masks (big one), staying at home(big one), social distancing, temporary lockdowns, etc. Therefore, say with an R of 1.5, you would get herd immunity at 33% infected (presymptomatic, asymptomatic or symptomatic).\n\nThe point I was making was that IFR may be <= 0.5% but potentially everyone is vulnerable to getting infected if we do not distance, which means a small percentage of a big number is still a pretty big number and therefore everyone is taking it seriously.\n\n----\n\nNow, in this post, I would like to add that the virus obviously seems to affect the rich, the poor and the powerful equally and therefore, human power structures have begun to respect it, unlike in the case of cold and flu. Nobody shuts down schools for the flu or for tuberculosis or malaria, even though poor people die in the 100s of 1000s annually from those diseases, but most of them are poor and/or don't matter.",

That is relatively simple, but remember the virus can take 10-14 days between infection and symptoms. So potentially, you could have an exposure during your one week study and not see a second degree case until almost a month later. So at a minimum you are looking at 5 weeks of JUST data collection.\n\nNow you have to look at the data. Can you conclusively say that person A transmitted to person B? Only if everything is properly contact traced and genetically sequenced. That is not easy and can take time to contact everyone and piece together the timeline, especially with high rates of the virus in the general population and asymptomatic infection. \n\nWhen you are developing a product, you have to focus on certain things. Usually, baseline performance and safety are two of those. Smaller details get pushed to the side until resources become available. Mask mandates wouldn't go away until a significant portion of the population is vaccinate anyway, so why rush the data to help make that decision? You really want to make sure you get it right.\n\nThere are so many more factors to this, but this vaccine is \"scientifically\" approved because they properly applied the scientific method to prove its safety and efficacy. The data they currently have( and what you are proposing) does not meet the definition of \"good science\", so it wouldn't be approved by anyone in the community. For good reason.",

This question was not studied as part of the clinical trials. Until there's certainty, the whole point is to continue wearing masks until everyone/a greater proportion of your personal network (family/friends/coworkers) is vaccinated. \n\n>Will the COVID vaccine prevent me from infecting others?\n\n>The answer is, we don't know. Clinical trials of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines found that both do a good job preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease, including severe COVID-19. However, the trials did not measure whether a person who is vaccinated is less likely to spread the virus to someone else.\n\n>It's possible that the vaccines protect against COVID-19 disease by preventing a person from becoming infected in the first place. However, it's also possible that the vaccine protects a person from COVID-19 illness, but does not prevent a person from becoming infected. In other words, a vaccinated person may have replicating virus in their nose and throat even if they are protected from becoming sick.\n\n>But does that mean that you have enough virus in your nose and throat to infect someone else? Not necessarily. It's possible that the immune response triggered by the vaccine, which protects you from becoming sick, also reduces the amount of virus in your nose and throat to a point where you are unlikely to spread it to someone else. But we need more research to know for sure.\n\n>The bottom line? If you're among the first groups of people to get vaccinated, it's best to continue wearing masks and maintaining physical distance in order to protect others who haven't yet gotten the vaccine.\n\n[https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus#:~:text=The%20answer%20is%2C%20we,protected%20from%20becoming%20sick](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus#:~:text=The%20answer%20is%2C%20we,protected%20from%20becoming%20sick.)",
