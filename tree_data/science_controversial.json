If you look at the development of most countries in Europe they also went through stages of Tribalism -> Warlord's or despots -> Unified by one (often extremely intolerant) religion -> Feudal monarchy approved by the church -> emerging merchant class -> development/enlightenment -> modern civil institutions -> parliament v monarch civil war or revolution -> democracy.\n\nSo when there is a situation like when the 'Islamic Courts' movement took over Somalia, ending the civil war for the first time in decades, it's kind of counterproductive that the US bombed them for being Islamic Fundamentalist. Somalia slipped back down the scale into tribalism, civil war and piracy. Even an undesirable regime can provide the stability needed to develop further. \n\nThis is probably the lesson from Afghanistan as well. Trying to 'make people free' just doesn't work they have to get there themselves. Now it may take them a thousand years to grow from religious rule of law to a functioning democracy, but interfering only makes things worse..",

I know better, but tried to truncate the exanation as I was distracted.  Corrections inserted.\n\n The (very) basic concept behind the vaccines is that injecting short strands of synthetic RNA that mimics viral RNA.  Multiple channels of immune response are triggered, the RNA is examined, copied, and antibodies made, etc,\n\nBut, in order for the response to be robust enough to do any good long term, the injection must actually trigger an immune response.  That's why a sore arm is a good thing, and why body aches aren't necessarily bad.  You aren't sore from the needle, but from the inflammatory response to perceived \"invaders\".\n\nWhen the immune system notices MORE viral RNA, and detects it for LONGER (correction: when mRNA continues entering cells periodically to be made into spike proteins) your body thinks it's an army coming, instead of just one guy you already caught outside the walls snooping around.  You get a better, bigger, broader yet more specific, and longer-lasting response.   So, it's good that vaccine-specific RNA is still detectable in the body for 15 days, rather than say, two days after the shot.",

It could be interpreted as \"has completely decayed\", \"begins to decay\" or even \"is in the process of decaying\". I don't speak Czech, so I will have to take your word that the intended message is \"is completely gone\", even not at all clear from the English translation.  \nAlso, and this is a pet peeve of mine, but nearly every thread on this topic will at some point turn into an argument about what \"we were told\" or how the proverbial \"they\" have \"changed the message\". Communicating complex scientific topics to a diverse public audience is not an easy task. It's usually full of simplifications and should never be used as a primary source of information. Usually, this level of communication has been sufficient, but with COVID there has been an enormous increase in people engaging in scientific discussions. A lot of the discussion is based on information obtained from secondary or tertiary sources.",

From the abstract:\n\n> Shortly after the first or second mRNA vaccine dose, the IgG response mainly consists of the pro-inflammatory isotypes IgG1 and IgG3 and is driven by T helper (Th) 1 cells. Here, we report that several months after the second vaccination, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were increasingly composed of non-inflammatory IgG2 and particularly IgG4, which were further boosted by a third mRNA vaccination and/or SARS-CoV-2 variant breakthrough infections. While IgG antibodies were affinity matured and of high neutralization capacity, the switch in constant domains caused changes in fragment crystallizable (Fc)-receptor mediated effector functions, including a decreased capacity to facilitate phagocytosis. IgG4 induction was neither induced by Th2 cells nor observed after homologous or heterologous SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with adenoviral vectors. In addition, IgG2- and IgG4-producing memory B cells were phenotypically indistinguishable from IgG1- or IgG3-producing cells. Since Fc-mediated effector functions are critical for antiviral immunity, the described class switch towards non-inflammatory IgG isotypes, which otherwise rarely occurs after vaccination or viral infection, may have consequences for the choice and timing of vaccination regimens using mRNA vaccines.\n\nIgG4 is associated with immune tolerance. It\u2019s normally reserved for other situations where a foreign protein has found its way into the blood, such as when a complete protein has bypassed the gut membrane instead of being cleaved into peptides and amino acids. \n\nThe issue wasn\u2019t observed with adenovirus vector interventions. This is probably because an isolated foreign protein isn\u2019t being used as an immunogen - the immune system is being presented with a pathogen. \n\nThis study suggests that using an isolated foreign protein is effectively training the immune system to treat any pathogen bearing that (spike) protein signature as a food intolerance.\n\nThis also likely explains the negative VE which has been reported after a few months. eg.\n\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2118946\n\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2203965?query=featured_home\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.28.22276926v2",

You are referring to a subunit vaccine. It is much more difficult to express proteins in vitro than in vivo, especially in sufficient quantities to make a functional vaccine.\n\nNovavax, for example, has a protein subunit covid vaccine. The issue for those kinds of vaccines is supply (it takes a long time to get sufficient amount of vaccine to vaccinate a large population) and also the ability to adapt to variants. Because the protein needs to be expressed long in advance, it is much more difficult to ensure that the protein that is being used, as opposed to the vaccine that encodes for a protein, is current.\n\nSubunit vaccines also are more difficult to engineer to produce enough of an immune response to cause long lasting protection. mRNA vaccines aren't as proven in that regard either, so it's not as big of a difference.",

These types of living organisms are not easy to take care of, requiring careful monitoring of their living conditions before you can harvest the proteins for purification into a vaccine. \n\nThere are concerns about the safety and efficacy of the protein subunit vaccines; for one, to effectively stimulate the immune response for the immune system to recognize the injected protein as being foreign and therefore hostile, you have to use adjuvants to stimulate the immune response. And there has been some concerns from certain fields about the use of said adjuvants related to safety. \n\nFurthermore, to purify the proteins into something that is approaching safe and consistent for human usage as a vaccine is difficult to do at a large scale. Anyone who works in the biomedical manufacturing field that is cGMP certified recognizes this.\n\nFor a mRNA vaccine, as long as you have the mRNA strand that you want, it is relatively easy to replicate as many mRNA strands that you want as all you need is a mRNA replication enzyme, and let it work in a solution. The solution, after a while is easily filtered to extract impurities, leaving a solution filled with mRNA. \n\nThe difficulty has always been the delivery of mRNA into the body; mRNA tends to degrade extremely quickly outside of a cell. The latest breakthrough that has made mRNA vaccines possible is the process in encapsulating the mRNA strands in a lipid (fat) nanoparticle, which protects the mRNA strand long enough for it to enter a cell to the taken up by the cell's own protein production processes to produce the antigen proteins within the cell.",

To my layman brain, synthesizing the spike protein and then ensuring it is injected at the precise dose sounds more elegant. Why rely on the human body as a factory when it's a more unpredictable factor? Different human bodies can react differently to that, they might produce too little or too much. Unless this solution is so much cheaper, I don't see what makes relying on the much more complex and more varied reaction/performance of the human body so elegant.\n\nYou are definitely missing the point. \n\nIn a protein subunit, you are synthesizing a protein by using a yeast or bacteria to make protein, and then subsequently you've got to screen and purify the resulting mixture of yeast/bacteria/protein and inject that into a human. You also need to test to make sure that the way the yeast or bacteria expresses the protein isn't sufficiently different from the way that a human expresses it that you don't end up with an immune response that will be ineffective against the real thing.\n\nIn contrast, the mRNA vaccine uses human cells to express the proteins, which is the same mechanism that would happen from natural infection. Like when you get covid, your body is making more of the virus. Your body doesn't borrow yeast or bacterial cells to have the virus work against you.\n\nYou are synthesizing it either way. The point is we'd rather synthesize it in the same host as will be infected by the virus, which is also much simpler to manufacture. It's cheaper, faster, and you can make more of the vaccine.\n\nThere isn't as much human variation as you make it out to be, because humans are going to absorb the mRNA into their own cells and produce the proteins accordingly. You'll see a much greater variation in immune responses to the synthesized protein.",

A critical aspect to consider is how these errors   \nmight affect the efficacy of the synthetic mRNA drug substance and how   \nmuch of these error-prone molecules can be tolerated in vivo without any adverse effect. Because in vitro  \n transcribed mRNAs are modified throughout the body of the mRNA, it is   \nalso critical to consider if these mRNAs are faithfully translated in   \nthe cell. We have previously demonstrated that in human embryonic kidney  \n cell, low frequency translation elongation miscoding events are   \nobserved from \u03c8-containing mRNAs due to altered tRNA selection in   \n\u03c8-containing codons \\[22\\]. For m1\u03c8-substituted RNAs, it has been shown that translation initiation and ribosome transit is altered in vivo \\[14\\].  \n A complete understanding of what errors are incorporated during the RNA  \n synthesis process and how that further affects the identity of the   \nprotein synthesized is a timely question given that therapeutic   \napplications would require repeat dosing of the mRNAs and would also   \nrequire expression of the protein of choice. To be able to predict the   \nbest outcome from these synthetic molecules, it is critical that we   \nunderstand where variability comes from and to be able to define the   \nrules to avoid these variabilities.\"",

The difference in hospitalization rate is even higher, unvaccinated people are 20 times more likely to be hospitalized and it's more likely they will have to stay in the hospital longer.\n\nVaccines aren't about creating a shield that doesn't let the virus in.  It's about training an army inside you to kill the virus off quickly, before it can spread throughout your body, if it ever shows up.  It's literally just target practice for your immune system.  You could call it a 'concealed carry'.\n\nPeople with the vaccine overwhelmingly have few or no symptoms from it, are almost never hospitalized in comparison, usually don't end up losing their sense of taste and smell, and don't have to worry about \"long covid\" or ending up in the hospital.  They also fight the bug off faster, recovering in a few days vs. typically multiple weeks for unvaccinated people.  Again we have all these statistics and have for a long time.  You can't say \"I'm waiting to see real numbers, nobody has numbers\" if you just haven't been paying attention to all of the published research.\n\nThere is no remaining debate here that could ever be called honest.  You may as well argue that seat belts are useless because they don't prevent car crashes.\n\nThe vaccine is how we go back to normal guilt-free.

Oh but you're a special individual so you're exempt from this advice...\n\nIn all seriousness, this myocarditis most likely has nothing to do with these specific vaccines, but is rather a general outcome of an ongoing immune response. You can get it from flu, you can get it from food poisoning, you can get it from COVID, and yeah, you can get it from a vaccine, which is essentially simulating a viral infection. The stronger the vaccine, the more likely you are to get it. Note that most myocarditis cases occur after the second vaccination - even though the doses of the vaccine are identical for both the first and second dose. You just get a stronger immune response after the second dose and that's what's causing this inflammation. A super-strong vaccine, however, is still nothing compared to severe COVID in terms of inflammation and therefore health outcomes.\n\nWith respect to recovery, this is a well studied question because myocarditis after vaccination has gotten so much attention. Unlike with COVID-induced myocarditis in unvaccinated people, there is a close to 100% full recovery rate within a few weeks for myocarditis induced by these vaccines. Most of these recoveries are spontaneous. Here's a [source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-021-00662-w). So you're wrong. The myocarditis induced by vaccines is mild and temporary. COVID, on the other hand, has a 100x higher chance of giving you myocarditis, and when it does, the myocarditis is more severe. The kicker to all of this is that almost everyone will get COVID, if they haven't already. There have been over 80M confirmed and reported cases of COVID in the US, for example; the CDC estimated that 25% of cases are reported, meaning that the real case count is likely around 320M, which is pretty close to the population of the US. With near-certainty of eventual infection, the argument against taking a mild vaccine risk is essentially null.\n\nFinally, if COVID wasn't something that you can accidentally kill your neighbor with, then individual rights would be a sound argument. I don't care what you do if it doesn't affect me. The problem is, that it does affect me. 1 million people in the US have died from COVID. This is not an outcome of chance. It's an outcome of bad choices, sometimes made by the person who died, and sometimes made by their neighbor. If my neighbor made a bad choice that resulted in my dear mother's death, I would call that manslaughter.",

You are posting vague propaganda, brought to you by a 5 second Google search, in order to promulgate disingenuous and dangerous political narrative. All of which is the opposite of science, and scientific truth. The only truthful thing you say is that severity of long term damage is highly correlated to type of inflammation and severity of inflammation. And you think I disagree, or am somehow unaware of this? Does something in my diction or syntax indicate to you that I am unaware of such distinctions?\n\nYou googled \"is myocarditis bad\", and then copy and pasted google's curated response: \"Usually, a mild case of myocarditis will go away without any lasting damage. Severe cases may not be diagnosed until you have the symptoms of heart failure. Even severe cases may go away without notice, but these severe cases usually cause ongoing and irreversible damage to the heart muscle.\"\n\nYou think this is a scientific statement? Or that it somehow gives you any semblance of perspective outside of political rhetoric? Honestly?\n\n\"Usually\", a \"mild case\" will \"go away\" without any \"lasting damage\".\n\nWhat does this sentence even mean? You do not think I have read it before?\n\nI've read dozens of studies on perimyocarditis, listened to 20+ hours of America's most published pediatric cardiologist, read medical journals and socialized health care data out of Israel, Finland, Denmark, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Etc.\n\nHow about this statement. Does \"usually\" and \"excellent long-term prognosis\" calm your nerves equally:\n\n\"Long-term prognosis was usually good with a 3\u20135-year survival ranging from 56 to 83%, respectively. Patients with acute fulminant myocarditis, once they survive the acute illness, had an excellent long-term prognosis of 93% at 11 years, compared with 45% of the patients presenting with acute non-fulminant myocarditis.\"\n\nOr how about:\n\nThe main outcomes paediatric patients can experience include complete recovery, progression to DCM and death or transplantation \\[4,61,91\\]. According to Peta and co-workers\u2019 20-year study of 175 children with myocarditis, survival free from death or transplantation was 74% at one year, 65% at five years, 62% at 10 years, and 56% at 20 years. At 15 years after diagnosis, 60% of the participants remained free from transplantation, of whom 69% achieved echocardiographic normalization of left ventricular function, 96% were free of cardiac symptoms, 80% were not receiving long-term medical therapy, and 4% had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator \\[131\\]. Another study including 222 paediatric patients with DCM due to myocarditis revealed a five-year rate of freedom from transplantation of 81% and an estimated survival of 92% at one year and 90% at two and five years \\[119\\]. In an apparently paradoxical way, patients with fulminant myocarditis have a more favourable long-term survival than patients with acute myocarditis \\[61\\].\n\nALL perimyocarditis is INCREDIBLY serious. It must be treated immediately - with the utmost of urgency. And dramatic long term health impacts do \"usually\" occur.\n\nTalk to a cardiologist. Not a 5 second google result. Not a redditor. Ask them to present you with actual studies and statistics about long term data, not words like \"usually\" or \"can\" or \"may\". \"Usually\" can mean 50.1%. Or 99.999%.  \"Can\" or \"may\", can mean .001% or 99.99%. These are not terms or statements that are relevant, or even helpful. They are deceptive by construct, used with intent, to craft rhetoric. \n\nThese are not scientific terms. This is not reviewing medicine, medical prognosis, or science in a intelligent manner.\n\nPlease stop. You are embarrassing yourself.",

The score is based on changes from the norm of multiple protein inflammatory biomarkers including IL-16, a proinflammatory cytokine, soluble Fas, an inducer of apoptosis, and Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) which serves as a marker for chemotaxis of T-cells into epithelium and cardiac tissue, among other markers. Elevation above the norm increases the PULS score, while decreases below the norm lowers the PULS score. The PULS score has been measured every 3-6 months in our patient population for 8 years. Recently, with the advent of the mRNA COVID 19 vaccines (vac) by Moderna and Pfizer, we tracked the changes of the PULS score and three of the inflammatory markers it measures in all of our patients consecutively receiving these vaccines.\n\n>This report summarizes those results. A total of 566 pts, aged 28 to 97, M:F ratio 1:1 seen in a preventive cardiology practice had a previously scheduled PULS test drawn from 2 to 10 weeks following the 2nd mRNA COVID shot and was compared to the pt\u2019s PULS test drawn 3 to 5 months previously pre-shot. Each vac pt\u2019s PULS score and inflammatory marker changes were compared to their pre-vac PULS score, thus serving as their own control. There was no comparison made with unvaccinated patients or pts treated with other vaccines.\n\n>Baseline IL-16 increased from 35+/-20 above the norm to 82 +/- 75 above the norm post-vac; sFas increased from 22+/- 15 above the norm to 46+/-24 above the norm post vac; HGF increased from 42+/-12 above the norm to 86+/-31 above the norm post vac. These changes resulted in an increase of the pre vac PULS score of predicted 11% 5 yr ACS risk to a post vac PULS score of a predicted 25% 5 yr ACS risk, based on data which has not been validated in this population. No statistical comparison was done in this observational study.\n\n>In conclusion, the mRNA vacs numerically increase (but not statistically tested) the markers IL-16, Fas, and HGF, all markers previously described by others for denoting inflammation on the endothelium and T cell infiltration of cardiac muscle, in a consecutive series of a single clinic patient population receiving mRNA vaccines without a control group.",

The risk of myocarditis following the mRNA vaccines has been evaluated by the US Food and Drug Administration, which concluded that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks and fully authorized the use of mRNA-1273 in persons 18 years or older and BNT162b2 in persons 16 years or older. In addition, BNT162b2 is authorized for emergency use in children 5 years or older.20,21 The European Medicines Agency concluded that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks and approved mRNA-1273 for use in persons 12 years or older and BNT162b2 for those 5 years or older.22,23 In addition, a comment published by the American College of Cardiology24 evaluated vaccine-associated myocarditis risk and concluded that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks. As of January 2022, there have been nearly 5.8 million deaths associated with COVID-19 worldwide since the start of the pandemic.25 All currently available SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are highly effective against severe COVID-19 and provide some protection against transmission and infection.26-28 There is some evidence that the mRNA-1273 vaccine, possibly owing to its higher concentration of mRNA, is associated with increased immunogenicity and effectiveness.29,30 This more profound immune response could be one reason for the higher risk of myocarditis, but this hypothesis needs to be investigated further.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re right that they aren\u2019t endorsing it or not but this part of the Discussion portion does acknowledge it, if not tangentially.

The variance is for people that got at least one shot and any combination of two shots. Only one group was higher than 5. So apropos of nothing else, we're talking an overall increase in events of something like 0.0011%, if everyone got the worst combo.\n\nEven the study itself admits the confidence interval overall indicates that there's a possibility that a single vaccine dose might actually prevent these diseases.\n\nSure, it is statistically significant, but it represents a very tiny uptick overall, and if anything proves, beyond a doubt, that it's not a reason not to get vaccinated.",

Just a temporary inflammation.\n\nAlso:\n\n\\>Results of this large cohort study indicated that both first and second doses of mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis. For individuals receiving 2 doses of the same vaccine, risk of myocarditis was highest among young males (aged 16-24 years) after the second dose. These findings are compatible with between 4 and 7 excess events in 28 days per 100\u202f000 vaccinees after BNT162b2, and between 9 and 28 excess events per 100\u202f000 vaccinees after mRNA-1273\n\nSo in the first vaccine, you have about a 0.000055% chance of something mildly bad happening to you in the first 28 days of the covid vaccine, while in the second vaccine you have a 0.0002% chance of something mildly bad happening to you in the first 28 days of the covid vaccine.\n\nAnd this is only for the mRNA vaccines. So this would apply to Pfizer and Moderna, but not to Johnson & Johnson or AstraZeneca vaccines.\n\nI hope your fiance is okay. But the numbers published in this paper do not alarm me at all. Cigarettes, alcohol, and a whole bunch of other things that are completely legal are about fifty thousand times more likely to kill you. In the case of your fiance, Its possible that it was not the COVID vaccine at all that triggered the encephalitis. \n\nIf your fiance has an autoimmune disorder, an HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection (very common diseases that are mostly asymptomatic), or recently visited an area with a certain type of mosquito, those are very common and well-known causes of encephalitis.",

Somehow it seems to have been marked read without me actually doing that...\n\nRegarding vaccines.  No vaccine is 100% safe for all people.  No vaccine is 100% effective.  All vaccines fall on a spectrum in both regards, as do other medicines in fact.  But the Pfizer vaccine, for example, is quite good on both fronts.  We now have TONS of short and moderate-term human safety data and we see way, way less severe reactions than nearly any other vaccine I can think of.  What we don't have yet is long-term (5-10 years or so) safety data.  Based on the mechanism of action, we all believe that long-term safety will be quite good, but this is being done in real time, so there will be no way to know for sure for a while.  However, a risk/benefit analysis says that the benefit of being vaccinated far outweighs the risk of being infected, or of vaccine adverse events.\n\nEfficacy is also quite good.  While there have been some much-publicized breakthrough infections, these are much, much lower in vaccinated people, and vaccinated people have less severe disease if it does happen.  The evidence for this is also overwhelming.\n\nRegarding the source of the vaccine, I'm sorry but it is not at all likely that SARS-CoV-2 was created.  There is no molecular evidence for this at all.  In fact, this virus looks just like other coronaviruses carried by bats.  And we know coronaviruses are prone to jump species.\n\nThis virus has not spared any country, west or east.  I'm not privy to the profits Pfizer or whoever is making, but why China (or any government) would want to feed them profits is unclear.  And I don't see how any of this can increase control over the population.  We're already all very under the control of the government.",

No nuance allowed and both sides always argue with solid arguments based on solid studies. I have no idea what's going on or who to believe.

If it was deliberately released by China or an arm of the CIA or some other supersecret elite organisation or if it got out by accident, I don't know. If it was released on purpose, there are also different theories. Weaken the west? Creating huge profits for certain companies? Enhance control over population? I guess everything is possible.",

It is also emerging that immunity derived from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine may not be as strong as immunity acquired through recovery from the COVID-19 virus \\[8\\]. A substantial decline in immunity from mRNA vaccines 6-months post immunization has also been reported \\[9\\]. Even though vaccinations offers protection to individuals against severe hospitalization and death, the CDC reported an increase from 0.01to 9% and 0 to 15.1% (between January to May 2021) in the rates of hospitalizations and deaths, respectively, amongst the fully vaccinated \\[10\\].\n\nIn summary, even as efforts should be made to encourage populations to get vaccinated it should be done so with humility and respect.

Even if those antibodies don't prevent infection, they still \"should be coating that virus with antibody and therefore helping prevent excessive downstream transmission,\" Kedl says.

Women exposed to cowpox were immune to smallpox due to the viral structural relationship.  That is the very BASIS of vaccination.\n\nSOME vaccinated people get diseases during outbreaks.  These are typically the immunodeficient or those whose vaccinations have expired.  This is also because viruses mutate.  The  unvaccinated people get the disease more frequently.  Even the TB vaccine, which is not considered a good vaccine by most, shows good results, with [24% of unvaccinated school aged children getting TB compared to 9% of vaccinated in endemic regions.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17536134?ordinalpos=4&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum)\n\nI'd challenge you to do your own research instead of buying into conspiracy theories about vaccination.  [How about doing a pubmed search, such as this article that shows a 99% decline in deaths after the initiation of historical vaccinations?](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18000199?ordinalpos=3&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum)\n\nThere are numerous other sources of vaccine efficacy.  There is a \"ton of money\" involved here but there is also a ton of cost savings, with vaccines being [one of the few public health interventions that may directly lower medical costs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17955624?ordinalpos=19&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum).  You seem to be of the opinion that a physician would give you a vaccination to make himself money, but a vaccination is one of the procedures of least value to a physician with them typically billing less for that than any other procedure.  It costs a lot more to keep somebody in ICU with a terminal pneumonia than it does to give them an injection when they're born.  The people who cost either the public health system or the private insurance companies the most are those who are unvaccinated.  ",

Unfortunately, this problem is commonly encountered in scientific writing. Given a sufficiently large sample, extremely small and non-notable differences can be found to be statistically significant, and statistical significance says nothing about the practical significance of a difference.\n\nOne of the more common problems in significance testing is the tendency for multiple comparisons to yield spurious significant differences even where the null hypothesis is true. For instance, in a study of twenty comparisons, using an \u03b1-level of 5%, one comparison will likely yield a significant result despite the null hypothesis being true.\"\n\nCertainly you don't show such statistical prowess as to merit your condescending and uncivil tone.",

In either event, the *measure* of statistical significance (ie. z-score or t-score) is *the same*. The conclusion you draw from a statistically significant result is to look either for confounding factors, a causal mechanism, or a flaw in the test design or execution.\n\nBut if this explanation is too complicated for you, and I have reason to suspect that it is, then I suggest you go and count the number of times the words \"cause\", \"causal\", \"causation\", and \"correlation\" appear in the text of the [three page Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance) on statistical significance.

Other individuals produce increased cortisol, an immune suppressing hormone, to suppress the vaccine induced inflammation. The increased cortisol leads to type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Japanese children have increased cortisol secretion following immunization compared to White children and this explains why Japanese have a relative high rate of type 2 diabetes but low rate of insulin dependent diabetes compared to Whites.\n\nAs you can see, vaccines increase Cortisol secretion.\n\nNow go to Wikipedia's page for Cortisol, and read this:\n\n> Cortisol counteracts insulin by increasing gluconeogenesis and promotes breakdown of lipids (lipolysis), and proteins, and mobilization of extrahepatic amino acids and ketone bodies. This leads to increased circulating glucose concentrations (in the blood) by increasing gluconeogenesis. There is an increased glycogen breakdown in the liver.[3] Prolonged cortisol secretion causes hyperglycemia. Cortisol has no effect on insulin.[4] The reason why in vivo experiments seem to deny this is that cortisone (a cortisol metabolite) greatly inhibits insulin. So the cortisone-cortisol equilibrium may explain why in vivo experiments contradict the cortisol effect.[5] Cortisol does cause serum glucose to rise, but this is probably an indirect effect caused by stimulation of amino acid degradation, especially that derived from collagen in the skin. Loss of collagen from skin by cortisol is ten times greater than from all other tissue in the rat.\n\nHere you go, there's the relation.",

They do not have the emotional blinders and filters that adults do (thats a big part of their emotional development is figuring out how to deal with living their daily life while they live in a world where people are starving to death, dying under oppressive regimes, etc.  Children have nearly no empathy whatsoever.  Adolescents get empathy in full practically overnight.  It is overwhelming.)  When they are dating someone, they feel it more intensely than most adults probably do.  There are exceptions, of course.  There are always the 10% of sociopaths who feel nothing, but most teens have very intense emotions.  As adults we may look at their relationship and see it as superfluous, especially when they change boyfriends/girlfriends often, but those teens are desperately seeking to connect with someone.  They are seeking to have the very real physiological and psychological need for close physical and emotional contact and bonds filled that they once had filled by their parents and siblings.  It is difficult for me to understand how people can acknowledge that doing something like keeping a child in a box for years will destroy them for life, and yet people think that doing practically the same thing to adolescents shouldn't have any effect at all.  No it might not cause them to become mentally retarded, but clearly it can lead to emotional retardation.  People continually point out that the brain of an adolescent doesn't finish developing until their 20s, but they don't seem to have the slightest idea what brain development entails.  It is the most basic of neuroscience facts that extreme deprivation of any kind during the formative years of the brain will lead to substantially damaged results.\n\nIt doesn't turn them into psychopaths at all.  If that was the impression I gave, I assure you it wasn't intended.  Psycopaths are completely different.  No, it causes them to become emotionally retarded.  When they are faced with large emotional crises, they don't know how to deal with them.  And they can never learn.  When they lose a parent, or get divorced, or go through other extreme emotional situations, its common for it to have a larger than normal affect on their life, sometimes resulting in disorders akin to PTSD or the like.  Their ability to relate to their children as authority figures is severely diminished as they believe it is the job of the parent to be the childs sole emotional companion, they don't understand how people can maintain friendly relationships with members of the opposite sex without those relationships escalating to a sexual nature.  They can't quite understand the difference between sex and love because they may have never had one without the other, etc.  All of these things cause severe problems in peoples lives and I wouldn't wish such problems on anyone.  The experiences one has to go through as an adolescent to develop properly are intensely painful (and equally intensely blissful) but they are necessary.  People simply cannot develop in a beige world of no stimulus.  That leads to nervous breakdowns, and severe psychological problems that leave people unable to care for themselves.\n\nSex also has TREMENDOUS health benefits.  Just search for \"sex benefits\" and you'll find hundreds of studies pointing out that people who have more sex live longer, people who have better sex live longer, people who have more orgasms even if brought about through masturbation live longer, they have lower incidences of cancer, it improves function of the immune system, etc.  As human beings, we evolved with sex as the very core of our being.  Trying to deny or suppress that core is anti-human and very harmful.  Any attempt to suppress the sexual nature of human beings leaves behind in its wake a litany of psychological, and often physiological, disorders.  People in society now have less sex than ever before in history.  Even in ages as strict as the Victorian age, when sex was demonized, people still engaged in it more regularly than most western cultures do.  Viagra is helping to make up for the fact that we've cut off the first third of a persons sexual life where probably 90% of sexual activity used to occur, but its not quite balanced yet.  There are loads of books on the subject.  Check out \"Guns, Germs, and Steel\" sometime.  It's not specifically about sex at all, but it discusses one of the drastic changes that has occurred in society, with relatino to breastfeeding children and its very fascinating.  People assume that before birth control that people curtailed their sexual activity because it would result in large families... that's quite untrue however.  It used to be (for reasons explained in the book) that women would only ever have a couple dozen menstrual cycles in their entire life, and they would be effectively sterile for the majority of their life, during which time sex was very plentiful as it was almost entirely consequence-free.\n\nIt's a huge subject... this is why I always say that sexual education should be at the VERY LEAST a year-long course when kids are 12 years old.  Maybe a year or two before, but 12 seems to be a good age.  It makes no sense to furnish kids with information when they don't understand how it is relevant to them or AFTER they actually NEEDED to have it.",

And they were absolutely not as chaste as you would believe.  You do realize that if a society has to make rules against something, it means that thing is very widespread?\n\nPromiscuity and a healthy attitude towards sex are two completely different things.  If you encourage abstinence, argue against masturbation, prevent any form of physical contact with peers whatsoever, you are going to psychologicallty damage that person for the rest of their entire life.  It is incurable if they do not have some intense emotional relationships which include a sexual compoent before they are in their 20s.  It's biology.\n\n>Also, one can masturbate to relieve oneself.\n\nAbstinence only proponents do NOT advocate masturbation.  They argue vociferously against it.  And you cannot be logically consistent by advocating masturbation and acknoledging the sexual need that adolescents have and still advocare abstinence in a culture that has perfectly workable contraception avaialble.  The backing of all abstinence is mythological voodoo bullshit that has no grounding in physiology, biology, or developmental psychology.  Read up on any of those subjects before propagating \"abstinence is harmless\" ideas, because it's completely wrong.\n\nWhen the brain stops developing in the early 20s, exactly why do you think it will be able to develop the ability to have deep and meaningful relationships if you effectively keep the person in a box until their brain has already stopped developing?",

Some of her points were valid concerns like over-prescription and lack of preventative medicine, but when it came to vaccinations she seems to think that all vaccines are pretty much just downs syndrome waiting to happen and full of cancer and mercury. Apparently there's a large segment of the chiropractic community that holds such ideas. I would suspect such persons may be capable of finding the motive and ability to contaminate vaccines, but I doubt any of them that hold out any sense would do so.",

However, my guess would be that those are the HPV strains that can lead to cancer, not the ones that cuase warts.\n\nDo you have other sources I am missing?",

Since HPV has been linked to penile and anal cancers, some men, especially gay men, are choosing to get the vaccine before the final results are in.\n\nfrom the LA Times, March 19, 2007:\n\n\"Merck is conducting studies of the vaccine's ability to prevent infection in boys and men. Data on those trials may become available later this year, and the company hopes to apply to market Gardasil to boys and men some time next year.\n\n\"Studies of Gardasil show that the vaccine provokes an even stronger immune response in boys than in girls, which implies that the vaccine will also prevent HPV infections, Blumberg says. But they have yet to show that boys are protected from HPV infection at satisfactory rates. Researchers are also examining whether the vaccine reduces cases of anal cancer in gay men.\n\n\"There is \"no guarantee\" an HPV vaccine will work in men, Broker says, because the skin cells infected by the virus differ greatly in men and women.\"",

A 2008 NIST report described a similar progressive collapse as the cause of the destruction of the third tallest building located at the World Trade Center site, the 7 WTC.

The Psychological Roots of Anti-Vaccination Attitudes: A 24-Nation Investigation. *Health Psychology* (2018).](https://doi.org/10.1037/hea0000586)\n\n> **Objective:** Strengthening of antivaccination movements in recent decades has coincided with unprecedented increases in the incidence of some communicable diseases. Many intervention programs work from a deficit model of science communication, presuming that vaccination skeptics lack the ability to access or understand evidence. However, interventions focusing on evidence and the debunking of vaccine-related myths have proven to be either nonproductive or counterproductive. Working from a motivated reasoning perspective, we examine the psychological factors that might motivate people to reject scientific consensus around vaccination. To assist with international generalizability, we examine this question in 24 countries.\n> \n> **Methods:** We sampled 5,323 participants in 24 countries, and measured their antivaccination attitudes. We also measured their belief in conspiracy theories, reactance (the tendency for people to have a low tolerance for impingements on their freedoms), disgust sensitivity toward blood and needles, and individualistic/hierarchical worldviews (i.e., people\u2019s beliefs about how much control society should have over individuals, and whether hierarchies are desirable).\n> \n> **Results:** In order of magnitude, antivaccination attitudes were highest among those who (a) were high in conspiratorial thinking, (b) were high in reactance, (c) reported high levels of disgust toward blood and needles, and (d) had strong individualistic/hierarchical worldviews. In contrast, demographic variables (including education) accounted for nonsignificant or trivial levels of variance.\n> \n> **Conclusions:** These data help identify the \u201cattitude roots\u201d that may motivate and sustain vaccine skepticism. In so doing, they help shed light on why repetition of evidence can be nonproductive, and suggest communication solutions to that problem.",

Out of a pool of 2.5 billion people, using the US prevalence rate, you would expect to normally see 25,000 people develop the disease annually. So far about 4.65 billion people have been vaccinated.\n\nThere will be unfortunate people who have their first flare-up right around the time they got their vaccination. While I think it's important to consider autoimmune outcomes for this vaccine, I have yet to see any evidence of significance to this report. Seems a lot like correlation not causation.",

I wish people would vet the information they get before putting out misinformation like this.  \n\nRe: HIV - to suggest that this is the likely source of HIV spread in the US is to be totally ignorant of the extensive research done on the topic.  According to evolutionary analysis of the HIV clades - it seems to have crossed the species barrier in Western Africa - likely in someone exposed to a lot of monkey blood - ie butchers.  Yes at the time we were completely ignorant of the virus and hindsight is 20/20, leading to the uncomfortable joke the interviewers made.\n\nThe subtitles added in belie the scientific ignorance of the producer of this film.  It mostly argues for a desperate need for science literacy in the general population.  Of course vaccines contain foreign nucleic acids/protein, how else do you make a specific immune response to a foreign body, unless you expose the immune system to those antigens.  Our body is constantly exposed to such foreign bodies, that's the way its designed to function.  Sure molecular mimicry by certain pathogens can lead to allergic/autoimmune responses, but that's hardly an argument against vaccination - its an argument for further study into immune processes to avoid these conditions, and also not a concern in the current context.  Also - listing the ingredients involved in standard adjuvent preps is hardly informative to the lay person.\n\nIs there some sort of conspiracy theory forming around the idea of endorsing the use of the killed Salk Vaccine until the live Sabin vaccine is in use - why the clip?  Also the non-sequitor \"This is the initiation of the global cancer pandemic\" is intellectually dishonest, and blatantly fraudulent.\n\nIn the end, this is an interview with a famous scientist, explaining how he developed a method for discovering contaminant virus in a vaccine prep - and somehow this is devious?  1:10000 SV40 virions survive the formalin fixing, meaning only very occasionally will a dose contain even a single contaminant virus in a limited test trial.  Not to argue that this is acceptable for wide distribution - but to suggest this is somehow the birth of a global pandemic is ridiculous. I also didn't see any argument that they didn't rid the SV40 contamination before releasing this vaccine to the general public.  I'm also not convinced SV40 causes cancer _in humans_ to begin with.\n\nAnd yes, wild viruses to cause cancers.  I think you'd be hard-pressed to argue that SV40 is a significant cause of cancer in humans, with all the herpesviruses out there.  ",

Several different methods have been used to detect SV40 in a variety of human cancers, although how reliable these detection methods are, and whether SV40 has any role in causing these tumors, remains unclear. As a result of these uncertainties, academic opinion remains divided, with some arguing that this hypothesis is not supported by the data, and others arguing that some cancers may involve SV40. However, the United States National Cancer Institute announced in 2004 that although SV40 does cause cancer in some animal models, \"substantial epidemiological evidence has accumulated to indicate that SV40 likely does not cause cancer in humans\". This announcement is based on two recent studies.\n\nSo it sounds like there is unlikely to be anything to worry about, but there is still controversy in the field.",

This is because there will not be enough carriers for the disease to pass through to get to the baby. \n\nBabies under 6 month are not supposed to be vaccinated.

Assuming you were even correct, by making everyone vaccinate, you only weaken the human species' immunology and make the entire species dependent on corporate products to protect humans from being sick. Then rather than letting humans with stronger immunities survive and reproduce, you now make for a larger population of humans that are deficient from even combating a common flu survive. And because the CDC advocates only a handful of flu strains each year, if a flu of a strain that isn't vaccinate (which is the majority of flu strains that exist each year) takes root, the entire human species is now vulnerable. So it's actually you pro-vax faggots that are endangering the entire human species.\n\nsecond, Normal babies are not at risk for infectious disease because normal babies are exposed only to a handful of people--mother, father, siblings, grandparents. It's only because of the (povert-ridden) modern lifestyle, where parents have to work and ship their kids off to government-sanctioned daycare, where kids are exposed to anywhere between 12-40 other kids that diseases spread rapidly. So if you want to talk about real herd immunity, anti-vax are pro-actual real herd immunity by quarantining their baby from dirty, filthy, disgusting, third-world shits you pro-vax faggots bring in to this world and dirty everything up like jungle monkeys putting their dirty paws all over a monet painting.\n\nfinally, Misdiagnosis is a huge problem. Doctors can misdiagnose up to 80% of whooping cough pertusis when it comes to organophosphate toxicity. Treating one instead of the other results in hugely dramatic results because treating pertussis when the child is actually sick with organophosphates will exacerbate the toxicity, and seeing as how this whole pertussis bullshit epidemic is occuring in California, which is a hugely agricultural area, it's easy to confuse the two. Let's not also forget that many of the children that died are from migrant farmers; hence the whole illegal people are dirty people bullshit.\n\ntl;dr: stfu.",

There are many people who can't be vaccinated, or who vaccinations can be ineffective. These people are protected by the majority of the community being vaccinated. They need to catch the disease from someone, you don't get it from no where.\n2. Babies are particularly at risk of this trend, they sit in a perilous state of being too young to receive the vaccine, but simultaneously being an age where contracting whooping cough can be fatal.\n3. Misdiagnosis is part of the problem, however don't be misled into believing that all misdiagnosis' are from a doctor. Young children, particularly those who receive external child care services are often sick with basic upper respiratory infections, these present similarly to whooping cough, as such the primary care giver is often late in bringing their child to a doctor to receive treatment.\n\nThe core argument here is that while a misdiagnosis can be a fatal, the actual presence of whooping cough itself correlates with lower vaccinations.\n\n\n**tl,dr;** the op misses the point of vaccination.",

In fact, we are meeting the CDC recommendations for vaccinations rates as a populace.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that these people are EXACTLY like Jenny McCarthy and her blind followers and, yet, they think that they are better than her.

It is not strictly an infectious disease - you don't get the bacteria from somebody infected, but from everywhere (they are everywhere - their normal place of living is the soil).

Getting rid of the bacteria themselves is easy for the body (they are specialized for eating dirt, not humans), but their extremely strong neurotoxin might kill you before they are gone.  That might be a reason that commercial insurances cover other vaccines for free (they would profit from the herd immunity created) but not tetanus (where the vaccination protects only the vaccinated person).",

Ireland had a thousand year history of no state.\n\n\nBack to the \"problem of vaccination\".   I already responded and I can expand some plausible scenarios.  People like you obviously care that everyone is vaccinated.  Perhaps you will have charities to do this.  And even business such as hospitals and insurance companies will have a self interest in preventing outbreaks.  Insurance companies will be interested in not having high liability.  I am sure that they can sponsor cheap vaccinations along with hospitals and concerned and informed medical professionals.\n\nYou don't need the fucking state.  This is just two small plausible examples.  I am sure that any such actual concepts, what ever they may be, would fill encyclopedias with the nuances of the relationships that are actually practiced.   I can't be required to come up with anything more here because I don't think you will care anyway. \n\nThe slavery economies of the south supported social services, back then I would have been more concerned with the actual slavery than the use of the monies for road building and of shit like that.  But I would have also asked, can't we fucking build roads with out slavery profits and no more fucking coercion?\n\nCan't we live where we don't have to extort money to do virtuous things?  Yeah, call me an anarchist.  I am against aggression.  The state is aggression, I am against that, therefor you can label me an anarchist.\n\nBut you still cling to the single solution of the state.

Some of the ones that use aluminum as a binder can be replaced with other options.\n\nYou act like we should trust everything that we are told.  Doing your own research (reading legitimate information, not Jenny McCarthy's book) is important and many physicians are too lazy to offer several options to their patients even though almost every vaccine has more than one option as far as administration methods.\n\nBut your attack on my intelligence certainly brings something to this discussion.

Passing them around from person to person is a very bad idea.  Deaths are rare because running into someone with pertussis in the first few months of life is uncommon, and because even when babies do contract pertussis it is often caught and treated.  Very few cases go un-caught and proceed to mortality.  (Which, by the way, is what the OP posted the article about -- the doctors missed the signs and the babies died as a result.)\n\nIf you are asking why there is an epidemic right now, the answer is two fold: pertussis occurs in cycles, something which is poorly understood at this time, and more parents are refusing vaccination which substantially increases the risk of dying from pertussis for those who are under a year of age but would otherwise have had at least two doses.",

I am still not understanding the logic of the vaccine though in terms of the specific idea that it can prevent deaths in newborns, whether directly or indirectly. \n\nIf all of those who die are basically under 2 months, they would never have been protected anyway, other than by breastfeeding. The under 2 months age group dies not because they weren't vaccinated, but because they're respiratory system is extremely vulnerable, correct? In other words, a 6 month old who contracts pertussis and was not vaccinated will develop a nasty paroxysmal cough, but it is extremely unlikely that they would die from it in the US.\n\nAs you said, there is likely only a marginal (if any, and it's not clear who has the advantage) difference in transmission rates between the vaccinated and the non. The unvaccinated who contract it while have a nasty cough vector, but will stay home and/or are clearly sick to the newborn mother, who avoids them. Those who are vaccinated will have it, but it will be mild and they are much more likely to still go to work or ride the subway or even hold the baby. Perhaps worse, those who go to work with these mild symptoms then have extended exposure to a caregiver/coworker (also vaccinated) who eventually contracts it and brings it home. Bringing a caregiver or family member back to the house with this mild pertussis will eventually infect the newborn due to the extended time period of infection (in all cases). In ready the articles that you've linked to, the vaccinated don't carry pertussis for any shorter period of time than the unvaccinated. \n\nWhat am I missing?",

Unfortunately there are multiple stages to the disease, and the most contagious stage is the catarrhal stage which is the same in both vaccinated and vaccinated persons.  In this stage symptoms are nonspecific, and you are spreading pertussis without knowing it.  Because of this, there is little difference in transmission rates between the two.  Diagnosis in unvaccinated/lapsed persons doesn't happen until the paroxysmal stage when the sever coughing begins.  One group knows know knows it was strongly contagious, while the other group does not.  The paroxysmal stage is still contagious, but not as much.  There is probably some small difference in transmission rates at this point, because the unvaccinated group stays home and coughs like crazy for a long time infecting those who are unlucky enough to get coughed on, while the vaccinated group goes out in public but doesn't cough that much.\n\nThe first dose is at two months, but it does not confer complete protection right away!  It takes multiple doses before you are safe.  (Some infants will become protected immediately, but most will not, or will only have partial protection.)  So your baby is vulnerable even after two months.  \n\nAs for what you have said about kissing babies with the snifles (or while in the asymptomatic catarrhal stage): that's exactly right, which is why you should never pass your newborn around to be touched and held, even among family members, but most certainly not by strangers, for at least the first two doses, better is three.  But, if you must let your mom/dad/brother/sister hold the baby, make sure they do not show ANY \"cold\" symptoms, and please keep it to the closest family members only.  I know it seems harsh, but that is the reality of the disease.  Most people do not have pertussis at any given moment in time, so usually you can pass the baby around and not have a problem.  But, there's always that chance... \n\nAnd breast feed.  Please breast feed.  To my knowledge no direct study of the correlation between breastfeeding and pertussis has been done, but one needs to be since breastfeeding is known to confer immunity for some diseases.  The WHO minimum recommendation is to breast feed exclusively for 6 months, followed by 6 months of mostly breast feeding with the introduction of solids, and some breastfeeding to two years.  It really does confer numerous benefits beyond mere nutrition.  Seek out a lactation consultant immediately after (even before!) birth.  Ask if the hospital has one.  Doctors tend to be poor lactation consultants, sometimes (often?) dispensing bad information, since breast feeding isn't really within the realm of either preventive or corrective medicine.  The three most important things to remember about breast feeding are these:  1) it will take 3 days before you get your milk in.  2) baby's stomachs are about the size of a pea, and they will need to eat VERY often, which is totally normal.  3)  losing 10% of body weight is normal before milk comes in.  Much of this is in the form of poop and pee.  This is why babies are born with fat stores.  Really, breastfeeding is a whole other story.  For another thread.",

But it does not work for the neonates because they cannot take it, and it does not offer herd immunity, and it is irresponsible to claim that it does, because people think they are safe passing their newborns around to others, and some use (non-existent) herd immunity as an excuse not to get their babies immunized.  The article you link to shows that when the vaccination rate fell that there was a pertussis epidemic.  I do not dispute that, and nothing I have said suggests you should not get vaccinated.  The fact is that when only 31% of persons are vaccinated, you are bound to have a large reporting rate, and it should be obvious from that and from what I have said that YOU SHOULD GET YOUR BABIES VACCINATED.  Having said that, the original claim that the babies that died that were too young to receive the vaccine might have lived had only enough people been vaccinated is just plain bad science!  They were probably infected by someone who WAS vaccinated, and that is the tragedy of pertussis, and why effort continues in search of a better, completely efficacious, vaccine for the disease.  Pertussis, unlike polio, cannot be wiped out until we find such a vaccine.\n\nPlease, if you get nothing else out of what I have said, understand this:  what I have claimed means that there is even MORE reason to get your baby immunized -- not less!",

(nb: lessen the symptoms for infants can mean living instead of dying.)  There is considerable debate as to whether the vaccine even reduces transmission or offers any herd immunity at all.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/09/health/research/09risk.html\n\nThose touting herd immunity are flat out ignoring the science that undeniably says this vaccine does not offer substantial herd immunity.  This is not some anti-vaccine rhetoric, just (unfortunate) science.  Nor does this mean you should not get your infant vaccinated: the vaccine does still provide some level of protection, it is just not total.\n\nThe fact is that touting herd immunity when there is so little to offer is actually bad for the cause.  Many parents choose not to vaccinate based on the idea that their child will be protected by herd immunity.  (Let everyone else vaccinate their children, my precious baby won't catch the disease because everyone else is vaccinated.)  But it doesn't work that way with pertussis.\n\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol6no5/srugo.htm\n\nSince the vaccine is not immediately effective, and since you cannot give it until a child is a certain age, and since you are most at risk for dying of the disease before you can even get the vaccine, the vaccine can only offer partial protection to children who get it.  Nevertheless, partial protection is much better than no protection.\n\nThe best defense for newborns is this: don't expose them to pertussis.  The best way to accomplish this is to prevent close contact (holding, kissing, getting sneezed on) with others as much as is possible.\n\nOne overlooked way to lessen the problem is encouraging an increase in breast feeding rates.\n\nIn very young children, antibodies can be conferred from mother to child via breast milk.  Babies' guts are \"leaky\" in the sense that they can absorb larger proteins whole than can adults' guts.  Mothers produce antibodies in their breast milk.  When the child breast feeds, these antibodies are able to directly cross into the baby's blood stream and confer transfered immunity.\n\nIf a mother is exposed to whooping cough (either along with or from her baby), she will begin to produce antibodies to the disease and these antibodies will be transfered to her baby if, and only if, she is breast feeding at that time.\n\nIt is amazing to me how many people ignore the science behind these issues and pretend to know what they are talking about when in reality they are touting just as much pseudo-science as the anti-vaccine crowd.",

Media has a bad habit of putting spin on things.  Additionally, typing \"maganese IQ\" into the Pubmed search will yield other papers that can support your arguments.  For laymen such as yourself, the best way to read a journal article (if you can get full access to it) is to read the abstract (this contains all pertinent information), the introduction which will give you background information, the figures which display the data gathered, and the conclusion, which is where the scientists theorize about possible impacts/solutions.  Terms with which you're unfamiliar can normally be found on Wiki, although some of it is pure jargon, so you might just want to Google it.  Ted Talks can be good for explaining some of the methodology--like PCR etc.  It's not a bad idea to have an overview of such things.  When weighing opposing opinions, it's necessary to take a close look at methods, as it can affect the outcome greatly.  Studies into treating menopause with hormones yield vastly different results dependent on what stage of menopause the hormones were give, the ratio of the hormones, the dosage, etc.\n\nGenerally, I'm more concerned about the antivaccine movement and the global warming deniers, as these are large scale embedded pockets of ignorance well recognized by the media.  This has given them an air of legitimacy, which is infinitely problematic.  The notion of \"emotional truths,\" and that opinions should be weighed with facts is very damaging.  I'm not talking about legitimate concerns about impacts on communities either; if something can reasonable be expected to affect a community, etc., then it's not an opinion, but a potential complication.\n\nI might be more concerned about what is in my water if I didn't have a job that generally necessitates constant low level exposure to chemicals, some of which are toxic.  For the most part, when people start talking about how you shouldn't put your glasses in the cupboard upside down because they use formaldehyde in industrial processes I tend to shrug my shoulders.  I'm not getting my panties in a knot over such a thing, as we're constantly exposing ourselves to various chemicals.  People often don't realize that their household cleaners present a greater threat than their melamine cupboards. \n\nEdit: To answer your question though about the validity of such a source--maybe.",

You might as well be skeptical of how cars and airplanes work.  There have been a lot of terrible accidents after all.\n\nTo address drug approval though, patent law plays a huge role in this.  Once a company submits a compound for a patent, that's when the clock starts ticking.  If they don't get all their preliminary tests, human trials, approval from the FDA done quick like a bunny, they won't have the drug out on the market in time to recoup the money they spent studying it.  Not to mention most compounds don't make it to human trials.  Not that drug companies aren't robbing people blind, but to chalk it up to greed is a grave oversimplification.  While I'm at it--if you're going to be questioning the safety of vaccines, an informed question to ask would be, \"What about Gardisil?  Wasn't that rammed through the FDA rather quickly?  And why is it approved only in women, despite that both sexes are involved in spreading the disease?\"  Not that I don't think it's a great vaccine, but as I said, there are concerns about it.  Frankly, you're more of a psuedoskeptic than a genuine one--you should be able to go toe to toe with me without any trouble otherwise.  As is, you're just saying, \"Some scientists are bad, some are good, and I can't tell the difference.\"  Frankly, as a member of Joe Public, it's not your job to question science, unless you're going to take the time to actually learn about it.  I don't walk into a mechanics garage and proffer my criticism, because I know fuck all about engines.\n\nAlso, if you look at the Tuskegee experiment, those agitating for change were members involved in the scientific community.  Remember the scandal about the women smashing kittens that PETA was all about?  How do you think they got that footage?  Any animal research facility is locked down--it was people working in the lab who made it happen.\n\nWhy don't you support unions or other protections for lab technicians; that would make a genuine difference.  It's hard to blow the cover of some unscrupulous scientist, knowing that you'll be deporting 5/6 families back to China or Russia, after they've spent so much time making America their home.  Not to mention you're essentially firing yourself, and you may never work in the US again.  Happened to my boyfriend's cousin, not that long ago in fact.  Things like these would precipitate genuine change, rather than feigning your ignorance has some logical philosophical backing.",

Even still, calling anything with mercury \"toxic and harmful\" overlooks important scientific facts. \n\n[Methylmercury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylmercury), a known toxin, is mercury bound to one carbon.  It accumulates in the body because it forms bonds with a particular amino acid.  Thimerisol contains mercury, but does NOT break down into methylmercury.  It breaks down into a different substance, called [ethylmercury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylmercury).  Due to its structure, ethylmercury does *not* form that same bond with the amino acid, and is [eliminated rapidly from the body](http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/index.cfm?id=160).\n\nOversimplifying organic chemistry is easy to do, but it's important to note that extremely similar compounds have vastly different effects on the body.  The compound known as [ibuprofen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen) (the active ingredient in Advil) exists in two forms.  These forms have the same formula, same atoms in the same proportion and assembly, but they are mirror images of each other.  Even though they are very close in so many ways, only one form provides a medical effect.  In a more well known and extreme case, the drug [thalidomide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide) also has two mirror-image forms.  One relieves the symptoms of morning sickness, while the other causes birth defects.\n\nIf just making a mirror image of a molecule has such a significant effect, imagine how much of a biological difference adding another carbon can cause!  Calling any compound with mercury in it a \"known toxin\" is a common practice among anti-vaccine groups, but it's really just FUD.\n\n**Edit:** Fixed links.  I can never remember reddit-markup!",

Certain symptoms can be part of how the disease spreads.  We are taught to cover our mouths when we cough because otherwise we're broadcasting germs.  If you cough less, there should be less risk of spreading the disease.\n\nAlso, if you get a less-severe case, there's a very good possibility that means you have it for less time.  Someone who has a contagious disease for 2 weeks can spread it to more people than someone who has the same disease for 1 week, because you come into contact with more people during a longer period.\n\nAnyway, from what I can dig up, the vaccine doesn't prevent the disease 100% of the time, but it does prevent it [59%-89% of the time](http://www.immunizationinfo.org/vaccines/pertussis-whooping-cough).  So even if it did nothing to reduce the spread from individuals who got the disease, it still prevents individuals from catching the disease, and that prevents the spread of it through a population.",

All states and the District of Columbia require children entering school to provide documentation that they have met the state vaccine requirements, according to background information in the article. As of March 2006, all states permitted medical exemptions to school and daycare immunization requirements; 48 states allowed religious exemptions; and 19 states had a provision for personal belief exemptions, such as religious, philosophical, and any other unspecified nonmedical exemption.\n\n>States that make exemptions widely available to parents, either by offering a personal belief exemption or making the exemption option easy to obtain, may have higher rates of exemptions or may experience substantial increases in exemption rates. Increasing exemption rates can increase individual and community risk to vaccine-preventable diseases, the authors write. The role of exemption policies may be especially important for pertussis, which remains present in certain areas of the United States and has been increasing in incidence during the past decade.\n\n>Saad B. Omer, M.B.B.S., M.P.H., of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, and colleagues conducted a study to determine if the rates of nonmedical exemptions differ and have been increasing in states that offer only religious vs. personal belief exemptions, and if the incidence of pertussis is associated with policies of granting personal belief exemptions and ease of obtaining exemptions. The researchers analyzed state-level rates of nonmedical exemptions at school entry from 1991 through 2004 and data for incidence of pertussis from 1986 through 2004 for individuals age 18 years or younger.\n\n>From 2001 through 2004, states that permitted personal belief exemptions had higher nonmedical exemption rates than states that offered only religious exemptions, and states that easily granted exemptions had higher nonmedical exemption rates in 2002 through 2003 compared with states with medium and difficult exemption processes. The average exemption rate increased an average of 6 percent per year from 1991 to 2004 among states that offered personal belief exemptions. In states that easily granted exemptions, the rate increased 5 percent per year from 1991 to 2004. No statistically significant change was seen in states that offered only religious exemptions or that had medium and difficult exemption processes. However, the researchers also found that easier granting of exemptions was associated with a 53 percent increased incidence of pertussis, and the availability of personal belief exemptions was associated with a 48 percent increased incidence.\n\n>\u201cStates must balance parental autonomy with the tremendous public health benefit of vaccines when considering the types of exemptions allowed and how policies are implemented. An approach similar to the model applied to conscientious objectors to [military] conscription, which focuses on the sincerity of the applicants\u2019 beliefs and includes administrative controls, may provide a reasonable middle ground. Our findings support the need for effective administrative controls over granting nonmedical exemptions. Moreover, state-level policies on nonmedical exemptions and documentation of immunization status should be viewed as part of the efforts to control or eliminate vaccine-preventable diseases,\u201d the authors conclude.\n(JAMA. 2006;296:1757-1763.

Notice how almost every other line in the article talks about the importance of vaccination.  Here's the whole thing:\n\n>Urging Californians to get vaccinated now, Dr. Mark Horton, director of the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), warned today that the state is on pace to suffer the most illnesses and deaths due to pertussis, also known as whooping cough, in 50 years.\n\n>\u201cWhooping cough is now an epidemic in California,\u201d Horton said. \u201cChildren should be vaccinated against the disease and parents, family members and caregivers of infants need a booster shot.\u201d\n\n>As of June 15, California had recorded 910 cases of pertussis, a four-fold increase from the same period last year when 219 cases were recorded. Five infants \u2014 all under three months of age \u2014 have died from the disease this year. In addition, 600 more possible cases of pertussis are being investigated by local health departments.\n\n>Pertussis is cyclical. Cases tend to peak every two to five years. In 2005, California recorded 3,182 cases and eight deaths.\n\n>Pertussis is a highly contagious disease. Unimmunized or incompletely immunized young infants are particularly vulnerable. Since 1998, more than 80 percent of the infants in California who have died from pertussis have been Hispanic.\n\n>The pertussis vaccine is safe for children and adults. Pertussis vaccination begins at two months of age, but young infants are not adequately protected until the initial series of three shots is complete at 6 months of age. The series of shots that most children receive wears off by the time they finish middle school. Neither vaccination nor illness from pertussis provides lifetime immunity.\n\n>Pregnant women may be vaccinated against pertussis before pregnancy, during pregnancy or after giving birth. Fathers may be vaccinated at any time, but preferably before the birth of their baby. CDPH encourages birthing hospitals to implement policies to vaccinate new mothers and fathers before sending newborns home. CDPH is providing vaccine free of charge to hospitals.\n\n>Others who may have contact with infants, including family members, healthcare workers, and childcare workers, should also be vaccinated. Individuals should contact their regular health care provider or local health department to inquire about pertussis vaccination.\n\n>A typical case of pertussis in children and adults starts with a cough and runny nose for one-to-two weeks, followed by weeks to months of rapid coughing fits that sometimes end with a whooping sound. Fever is rare.\n\nHow does that in any way exclude the possibility that vaccination is important in preventing the disease from spreading?  Or are you caught up on the part about recent cases being directly attributed to anti-vax groups?  Because it doesn't really matter what the reasoning is--whether it's ignorance of the need for a booster or a deliberate desire not to get vaccinated--the solution is still the same. ",

I use electricity, some of which comes from coal (although not much in the NYC region), which leads to mercury pollution.  I drive a car about 300 miles a month, which contributes to our dependence on foreign oil, spawns wars, and contributes to global warming.  I feed trolls on reddit, even when I know that it could lead to me being eaten by a grue.  I fly way more often than I should and when I can't get a carbon offset credit I just kinda say \"oh well\".  I indulge in cheap ass McDonald's food even though I've read Fastfood Nation and know about the horrible conditions in meat packing plants and know what it does to my body.\n\nHowever there is a distinct difference between those actions and vaccines.  People who don't get vaccines for their children because of the false belief that vaccines can cause autism are willfully putting their children and the children of others at risk by putting their heads in the sand and cowering from the real science of the issue.  Your issues are different because people acknowledge the risk and society has decided that those risks are worth it -- well except the condom thing, which last time I checked 48% of America thought was a sin, and 2% of America didn't want to acknowledge existed and believed that touching yourself was sinful too.  The benefit-cost analysis of the DPT vaccine (and most childhood vaccines) is so madly positive that you'd have to be willfully ignorant and denying the science to not get them. If there's a redditor who is having problems paying for these vaccines I'm sure that I and dozens of other redditors will gladly help you find the resources to get them -- the county health offices are a great place and were a godsend when my university couldn't offer me the vaccines.\n\nAlso, nice try at trying to make this an illegal immigration issue.  I'm sure that'll provide a lot of reassurance to my friends in Monterey, CA who just had a hell of a scare when their 2 month old got whooping cough.\n\nHere, have a cookie.  It's probably made with GMO wheat and sweetened with Monsanto corn and lard from animal that have known nothing but a cage their entire lives.

You contribute to an unsafe car culture that results in 40,000 to 50,000 deaths every year.\n\nAnd for buying factory-farmed animals, produced by an industry which is a key consumer and overuser of antibiotics which leads to things like MRSA.\n\nAnd what about your irresponsible lack of 100% consistent CONDOM USE?\n\nFor all you know, the vector that infected these kids passed through an intermediate chain of people who WERE vaccinated.  And the source could have been a child from Mexico who didn't have access to vaccination, and the people in-between might have had mild enough cases not to even know what it was.\n\nFor that matter, adults with mild cases of the FLU probably kill thousands of babies with underdeveloped immune systems every year.\n\nMistakes happen and dead to rights you've personally contributed to killing people unintentionally.

Many (dare I say most?) of the children who got sick and died of whooping cough were too young to get the vaccine, and therefore relied on herd immunity.\n\nHowever, idiot (and I use that term lightly here, I should term them sometime much worse) parents believe that they shouldn't vaccinate their kids.  This leads to the loss of herd immunity and a loss of protection for those children who are too young to get the vaccine. The fact of the matter is that if we had everyone, or at least most of the people immunized who should be immunized we wouldn't need to worry about infants with the disease.  They'd get immunized when they're old enough and contribute to protecting the herd. Instead we're seeing newborns and infants getting very sick and dying because of a disease that is 100% preventable.\n\nIgnorance and the desire to spread confusion, on the other hand, sadly appears to be, at best, endemic in the United States.",

At the same time the vaccinations for whooping cough have been around for decades and are very, very *safe* with little to no possible side effects. \n\n>That being said though if I can give myself and my kids some protection against the most serious illnesses why wouldn't I?\n\nI agree completely.  You sound like a concerned parent.  My argument is that there *are* vaccines that come out that are newly manufactured where the companies are trying a new bundling, different fillers, and so fourth.  These have *not* been tested on the general public like something the whooping cough vaccine has been.  Vaccine combos that have not been thouroughally tested *can* have serious side effects on you and your children.  My argument is simply to avoid those and vaccinate yourself and your children with vaccines that have been tested and are *for sure known to be safe*.  \n\nThe hivemind in general disagrees with me.  As soon as non-vaccination for *anything* comes up the reaction is *LOL DOWNVOTE YOU'RE A NUTJOB ALL VACCINES ARE 100% SAFE*.",
