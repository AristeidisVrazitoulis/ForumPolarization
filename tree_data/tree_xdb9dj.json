You\u2019re looking at Google search results man\u2026 not even actual statistics of any kind whatsoever. You could account this to more interests in sudden deaths so more articles, more people talking about sudden deaths, or literally anything of the sort. Could just be the year as well, both by the actual mention of it and when articles came out. A lot influenced Google search results, but I don\u2019t think it truly matters.\n\nAs for the general issue, yeah sudden deaths seem to be on the rise a bit. It\u2019s a scary topic, especially when it comes to causation. I do believe there\u2019s some merit to vaccines accounting for some, but there\u2019s a lot more going on in society than just vaccines at the moment.\n\nEdit: after reading some top comments, seems I\u2019ll have to elaborate on that last point a bit. We\u2019re in a heavy economic recession of sorts, with horrid inflation. People worry a lot more, do a lot more stupid shit, etc. It\u2019s at least a factor to account for as well in this case.",

In the study by Klein et al, the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were safe for the population overall (ie, there was no difference for any of the serious outcomes assessed), but an excess risk of myocarditis/pericarditis was identified for vaccinees aged 12 to 39 years. Anaphylaxis after mRNA vaccination was rare.\n\n[Safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine in a Nationwide Setting](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110475)\n\n>RESULTS  \nIn the vaccination analysis, the vaccinated and control groups each included a mean of 884,828 persons. Vaccination was most strongly associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 3.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55 to 12.44; risk difference, 2.7 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 1.0 to 4.6), lymphadenopathy (risk ratio, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.05 to 2.78; risk difference, 78.4 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 64.1 to 89.3), appendicitis (risk ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.01; risk difference, 5.0 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.9), and herpes zoster infection (risk ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.73; risk difference, 15.8 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 8.2 to 24.2). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a substantially increased risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 18.28; 95% CI, 3.95 to 25.12; risk difference, 11.0 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 5.6 to 15.8) and of additional serious adverse events, including pericarditis, arrhythmia, deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, and thrombocytopenia.\n\n>CONCLUSIONS  \nIn this study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting, the BNT162b2 vaccine was not associated with an elevated risk of most of the adverse events examined. The vaccine was associated with an excess risk of myocarditis (1 to 5 events per 100,000 persons). The risk of this potentially serious adverse event and of many other serious adverse events was substantially increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

VAERS processed 340 522 reports: 313 499 (92\u00b71%) were non-serious, 22 527 (6\u00b76%) were serious (non-death), and 4496 (1\u00b73%) were deaths. Over half of 7 914 583 v-safe participants self-reported local and systemic reactogenicity, more frequently after dose two (4 068 447 [71\u00b77%] of 5 674 420 participants for local reactogenicity and 4 018 920 [70\u00b78%] for systemic) than after dose one (4 644 989 [68\u00b76%] of 6 775 515 participants for local reactogenicity and 3 573 429 [52\u00b77%] for systemic). Injection-site pain (4 488 402 [66\u00b72%] of 6 775 515 participants after dose one and 3 890 848 [68\u00b76%] of 5 674 420 participants after dose two), fatigue (2 295 205 [33\u00b79%] participants after dose one and 3 158 299 participants [55\u00b77%] after dose two), and headache (1 831 471 [27\u00b70%] participants after dose one and 2 623 721 [46\u00b72%] participants after dose two) were commonly reported during days 0\u20137 following vaccination. \n\n>Interpretation\n\n>Safety data from more than 298 million doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine administered in the first 6 months of the US vaccination programme show that most reported adverse events were mild and short in duration.",

But first, they need a doorway into our cells. Coronaviruses are studded with spikes, which grab hold of proteins decorating our own cells like doorknobs. Once attached, the spike undergoes a dramatic transformation, stretching before partially turning inside out to forcefully fuse with our cells.\n\n>Scientists believe that for COVID-19 vaccines to be effective, our immune systems must develop antibodies that prevent this fusion. Such antibodies must target the spike protein in its aptly named prefusion conformation. Unfortunately for vaccine developers, spike proteins are liable to spring from their stubby prefusion shape into their elongated postfusion form on a hair trigger.\n\n>Through a bit of structural biology and persistent protein engineering, McLellan discovered that adding two prolines\u2014the most rigid of the 20 amino acids\u2014to a key joint of a vaccine\u2019s spike protein could stabilize the structure\u2019s prefusion shape.\n\n>\u201cIt is like a spring bent in half,\u201d McLellan says. When the spike protein binds to a human cell, that spring is released, and the two helices and the loop straighten into one long helix that harpoons the human cell and pulls the virus and human membranes close together until they fuse.\n\nThe mRNA spike is [locked into a \"prefusion\" state](https://acs-h.assetsadobe.com/is/image//content/dam/cen/98/38/WEB/09838-feature1-spike.jpg/?$responsive$&wid=700&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2). This prevents the mRNA spike protein from actually binding to human cells, unlike the wild type virus.",
