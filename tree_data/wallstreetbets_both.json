If not, you\u2019re gonna have to come clean to your parents. Be straight with them, don\u2019t try and bullshit it, but also be careful with how you convey it. Tell him you learned about investing into India\u2019s stock market, and thought making money in investing would work out, but that you ended up losing a portion in the process instead due to the economic downturn. Tell him you used the education money and apologize profusely for it, and promise him you will pay him back the amount lost. Also, if you come from a part of India where it is customary, bow and touch his feet asking for forgiveness. Expect to get beaten, yelled at, even disowned depending how they take it. They\u2019ll likely not put anymore money into your future, and it may affect your siblings future as a result. Also expect to not want him to talk to you for a while, and expect to be on your own. But do not get depressed about this, while a lot of people photoshop this for clout, there are people like yourself who are genuine and lost a lot. There\u2019s also guys here in America who go full retard and do drugs, sex, and alcohol then end up dropping out from college which their parents spend $50k per semester sending them to. So at least you\u2019re not in that position. Focus on your education, if you get a good job use that money to invest. But neither a good job or a good marker is likely in the current global market due to the WEF bringing about a \u2018Great Reset\u2019 for their New World Order shenanigans. Good luck.",

The net between the CALLs and PUTs trades provides a credit to your account which is your max profit if all 4 legs expire out of the money. Two legs are guaranteed to always expire out of the money leaving you with the net premium in your pocket.   \nIn my case the options all expire on July 5th. Too late for you for that trade. Some time after 2PM on July 5th, place your Short Iron Condor for options expiring on July 6th. On July 6th, close out your trade as profitably as possible and repeat after 2PM and before 4PM for options expiring on July 8th and so on. \n\nNote: Because Short Iron Condor Spreads  are a Level 3 trading strategy, almost all brokerage firms require you to fill out a margin agreement before they allow you to initiate a this trade.\n\nMay the 4 be with you!",

Instead, what is happening is that they all agree on the underlying premise and ended up being wrong and lost money. They've been losing money since March 2020.\n\nSo why can't you just short a company out of business? Well, it would require the company to be in dire need of immediate capital because shorting a company doesn't make it go out of business. They go out of business by being unable to pay debt.\n\nBut why not short to push the price down and then cover when the price is lower? Because the buyers generally aren't taking leverage.

        "body": "Judging from the average post and comment on here, most of you correctly suspect that the financial service industry and financial regulations have generally fucked you over, but you then seem to think that every possible way you might get fucked, no matter how far fetched, is actually true.\n\nI'm here to tell you that a broker doesn't try to trade against you when you execute a trade, the Fed doesn't directly lend money to hedge funds to short, short ladder attacks don't exist, that naked shorting is not happening, and hedge funds generally underperform the market so they're just as stupid as anyone else.\n\n1. Brokers find counterparties to trade with through market makers. They do not want to take the risk of being a counterparty to your trade, because they have no idea whether you are informed are not. They earn money through fees and in the case of RH, by selling order flow and by having poorer execution than most brokers.\n2. The Fed lends money to banks through the discount window. Yes, it is true that the most recent quantitative easing has benefited asset prices but not the economy, so it's been a bust from a social welfare standpoint and has basically been a net transfer of wealth from people who are newly saving to the already wealthy. (The first QE in 2008 and 2009 may have been necessary, but that's a more complex story.)\n3. Short ladder attacks just don't exist. I don't know what else to say about this one.\n4. Shorting goes above 100% of shares outstanding in the following way: a share is lent to be shorted and sold short and the investor who buys that shorted share lends it out again to be shorted. In theory this could go on arbitrarily high. It's fine to want a regulation that limits the amount of shorting as a percentage of shares outstanding. I think this is sensible and would mitigate volatility but there's no naked shorting going on.\n5. [Hedge funds have been underperforming](https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/study-sheds-light-on-why-hedge-funds-are-struggling/) by 0.8% per annum on a risk-adjusted basis since 2009.\n\nHow are you actually being screwed?\n\n1. While there is not direct regulatory capture of the Federal Reserve, numerous economists that work for the Reserve have thoughts of potentially getting high paying Wall Street jobs. They almost never want to write a paper that just shits all over banks. This and the fact that they speak to banks but do not speak to us directly means that their policies lean towards helping banks. This is isn't some weird backroom moustache twirling bullshit that seems to be pushed around. Unfortunately, it's a bit worse, since it's an endemic cultural problem with incentives that are hard to untangle.\n2. High frequency trading firms / market makers like Citadel, Jane Street, and Renaissance Medallion Fund earn their alpha in the most volatile periods for two reasons: they earn wide bid-ask spreads and the market is highly predictable on a short term basis during those periods, so they're effectively front-running the herd that is leaving or entering a position.\n3. Less of a problem in WSB, but mutual fund companies launch tons of funds and only market the ones that do well obviously. They rely on survivorship bias and luck to drive assets. They make different bets in different funds and they'll certainly have a winner somewhere.\n4. Brokers try to convince you that you can beat the market. The average retail investor does not beat the market. They are the counterparty to the institutional investor who does beat the market.\n\nHow do you avoid being screwed? However boring it is, if you buy and hold a global stock ETF, no one can ever fuck with you. It barely trades.\n\nEveryone SEEMS to be super self-aware of their own intellectual shortcomings (let's call it) but ironically, people then state utter nonsense with supreme confidence and everyone pats them on the back for being correct and \"in the know.\" (\"This guy still thinks that there are two political parties in the United States. Don't you know the parties are owned by the same corporate interests?\" Wow. So insightful and edgy, even though the two parties agree on almost nothing.) It's not that hard to nab a job of some sort at a large asset manager, and the pay isn't bad either. See how it actually is. It's far more mundane and when there's evil, it's banal evil--shutting down the underperforming fund and only mentioning the outperforming ones to prospective clients or trying to explain away bad performance in overly technical terms hoping that your clients think you're smart and don't fire you.\n\nThe industry needs to change desperately. It sucks away talent to do useless bullshit. It often acts as a net transfer of wealth from investor to asset manager. But it's not what you guys think it is at all.\n\nEdit: spelling",

If you want to help buy GME, NOK, BBB, or AMC (though admittedly AMC will go out of business eventually regardless but that's not what this is about). People are holding because if everyone sells, it enables hedge funders to mitigate their losses or even potentially making the short. I read several hedge firms funded their shorts again so it doesn't look like they are giving up. Its a game of chicken at this point.",

I can\u2019t believe the audacity and arrogance that a move like that required really existed in this world (naive of me). It\u2019s like they really just believed they could push us and just win forever with no accountability. Instead they lit a fire that will burn them down...at some point people would have taken profits and gone their separate ways with this, but now they made an enemy of us.

Typically in cases of suspected market manipulation, the SEC and/or FINRA ask for trade reporting and client information from the broker (Blue Sheets, OATS/ACATS reports, client onboarding info, Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Client background reports, etc.). With trade reporting, they match the client details to the \u201ctape\u201d - the records of the trades at the exchanges. I\u2019m guessing a LOT of brokers are about to get the requests for $GME buy and sell orders dated Jan 22nd to today. \n\nThese requests for trade reporting come in all the time, dozens per day, in various tickers and date ranges. Personal note: I\u2019ve actually hand-written the code to automate the responses for several banks whose names we all know. Often there\u2019s no real follow up to these requests - it may just be verification of counter parties or something even less interesting, who knows? The regulators don\u2019t disclose their reasons for the request. HOWEVER, we would occasionally get dropped with SEC requests that had an immediate response requirement, as well as requests for \u201clegal holds\u201d and copies of all client documentation related to certain traders. Depending on the language of the request, it could trigger a cascade of actions: retaining outside counsel, manual review of all relevant transactions by us (relatively) low-wage grunts, a bunch of conference calls with regulators confirming our compliance with both legal requirements and internal policies, and so on. \n\nAnything that seemed \u201coff\u201d would immediately result in some behind the scenes actions you as a retail account holder would never see. Your account could be flagged for daily or even trade-by-trade compliance review, Suspicious Activity Reports could be filed with the SEC (which is a complete black box - we were never made privy to the findings or outcome of those reports unless there was a public announcement by the SEC). Your ability to open new accounts of any type could be slow rolled due to extra review or even blocked. \n\nPart of a background check for the roles I would be applying for is a full review of all of my accounts. I\u2019m sure you could see why I initially backed the fuck out of $BB, but after seeing Leon Cooperman (who had to pay $5M for insider trading) crying about how this was an unfair attack on the wealthy?

In fact, I bought some $GME puts (which I've since sold since somehow they've gone up based on volatility) betting against the crowd here.\n\nHowever, what has started as a decentralized short squeeze has morphed into a class movement. I'm a big populist and think we need big changes in this country, especially a transfer of wealth and power from the elites to the people. When this morphed into a class movement I became obsessed. However, I still wasn't going to buy in because I shy away from speculating on ultra risky stuff like this. But when Robinhood and all the other major brokerages colluded to cause a massive sell off, that's when it became a matter of principle. I've watched all day as the stock has remained relatively stable on very little volume. People are holding despite wall street twisting your arm and trying to make you tap out by only allowing you to sell. It's a beautiful thing to see. I don't think of my purchase as an investment, but as putting my own skin in the game as a fuck you against a rigged system."

When you buy Gamestop, dont just stare at your phone all day. evertime i buy a stock, I gently squeeze my phone between my glute cheeks and set my phone to vibrate every time the shares moves. the tingling keeps me grounded and focused on the present moment. I find my mind wandering on painful past memories or future anxiety, but my new meditation mantra gently reminds me to focus on the present moment and remain mindful of all the boof stocks I'm buying. namestay is the way. Also, and this is super serious, if you've never had a prostate orgasm, this method is great at relieving stress and relieving the backlog of prostate milk youve built while holding Gamestop. Your investment is more than a financial revolution, it's spiritual orgasmic sexual revolution. Sure these hedge funds want your money, but they want even more than that. They want to repress your prostate milk. I'm talking pure spiritual energy that's inside all of you. Milk your prostate and release your tendies.\u00a0 Ladies can also tap into this raw spiritual orgasmic jet fuel by placing the phone on the front of your clitoral hood. My wife's gay boyfriend showed me where this is. many women apparently lack sensitivity in this nether region from Hitachi wand over use. This method can bring back that sensitivity and more.\nGamestop isn't just going to the moon. Its going to the milky way.",

Lets say you bought at retail. now lets say the price speculation made the ps5 worth $5000 each.   If you sell 1 at that price, you have already made your money back on buying 10.  the other 9 that you are holding. just  makes the price of the ps5 stay artificially high.  Also, you gotta imagine that there are no new ps5's being made.  (which is kind of how it is right now)  The short's, promised that they would sell you a ps5 at xxx because they thought that there would be a bunch of ps5's available. and are on the hook to provide those ps5's so they have no choice but to buy whatever there is. even at $5k.  \nHolding on to the stocks keeps the short sellers \"squeezed\". only way to release pressure is to sell.",

It may have been a ploy with the original fake ads, but now it's self sustaining and won't reset on its own.\n\nDo people really have to buy enough *again* to increase the value organically back up to what it was? Overall the ladder schemers have not made or lost money from their own market manipulation, and have more or less their original positions but with their goal accomplished. Ordinary folk have to double down to see only the increase in value they saw from their first effort.\n\nUnless I'm missing something? Is there some sort of mechanism in the algorithm that corrects for this? Any reason the price would go up easier than it did before as a result of the ladder attack?",

The computers of the hedge funds that run the algorithms (HFT) are installed inside the exchange's building to execute trade orders as fast as possible. The servers of these computers are co-located right within the exchange to get the lowest possible latency. A lower latency equals faster (trade) order execution, which the hedge funds can benefit from. The hedge funds pay the exchanges for these spots. It's basically impossible for a retailer to be faster than these bots because the hedge funds' orders are executed faster.",

This is very good news. Yes we took losses the last 2 days as expected that is because of these hedge fund ladder attacks. They are so desperate they are putting everything in their arsenal to drag down the price to put fear in AMC stock holders to sell. A lot of you fell for it!!! Just like a lot of you fell for it with GME. Mark Cuban Billionaire told us to hold!!!! Robinhood is now allowing 1,250 shares of amc. Get multiple brokers and consume and purchase and hold as much amc as you can we are about to take off... if you don\u2019t get in on this opportunity right now you will miss out on these discounted prices of AMC and GME. It was very important for us to hold the line. We can\u2019t let them win. They are very desperate right now. With the legal lawsuits with robinhood they are now tied down.... this is in our favor!!! The squeeze can happen now if we all work together... trust me on this! The patterns are similar to the GME and Volkswagen in 08 pattern.... please hold just trust me on this! If you want to change your families life forever stay according to the plan BUY and HOLD! Our turn is about to come, they are bleeding money these hedge funds.",

The price drop means absolutely nothing AS LONG AS EVERYONE IS HOLDING, this will explode!\n\nThe shirts tried their damndest to drive down the share prices of both $GME and $AMC today. Specifically look at $AMC. With all that volume traded you\u2019d expect a shitload more movement. What they got was **resistance** You could see them continuing the ladder attack after hours when YOU can\u2019t trade. On BOTH stocks. \n\nThe way forward is to tell them to go fuck themselves and BUY that shit up tomorrow. Let them keep punting the football back and forth to one another all day. If they can double down and play the long game SO can we. \n\nThis is not financial advice. I\u2019m just a retard who REALLY likes these stocks.\n\nEdit: **LOOK AT THIS SHIT LOL** https://twitter.com/beijing_bobby/status/1356377066988564486/photo/1\n\nEdit 2: **IF YOU\u2019RE WONDERING IF YOU ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING WITH $AMC EL PRES KNOWS AND IS STILL HOLDING.** \nhttps://twitter.com/Thowe51/status/1356320431142268928?s=20"

The banks mostly, but also businesses and whatever impacts the GDP directly. You can just call them the wealthy or top 1%. \n\nThey\u2019re the benefactors of quantitative easing. As well as the bailouts or stimulus. Sure, some of you apes got a $1200 check. Clap emoji. But that\u2019s billions not trillions. The big T goes to the 1%. \n\nSo basically the money is printed by the Fed for this QE (and stimuluses), which leads to inflation. BUT NOT DIRECTLY! (Loud ape noises) Not yet. For inflation to happen that money has to be circulated (measured by Velocity of Money). What does that mean? It means when apes get the money, it\u2019s worth a lot less. That\u2019s inflation. \n\nSo the 1% gets the magically printed money before inflation when the purchasing power is high. Yay for them. We get it when it\u2019s circulated and the purchasing power is affected by inflation making it much less. Boo for apes. \n\nInflation is about 2% a year these days. That\u2019s 20% every decade. So, for the apes in back, that means every 10 years all the money you put in savings loses 20% of its purchasing power. So you put $100k away in savings, then 10 years later it can purchase $80k what it could purchase when you put it in. This is the system. It wasn\u2019t designed for apes. It was designed for them. \n\nSo they get the money and what do they do with it? They invest, you big silly. The truly moronic of the apes think they just horde it and swim around in it like Scrooge McDuck. No. They invest. They invest mostly in businesses and real estate. Sometimes commodities. \n\nNow... enter the ape. Ape got money. Ape want to invest in these things too. That\u2019s great! They like that! As long as you play by their rules. So they teach you about mutual funds for your 401k, etc. They let the middle class play the stacked game in the stock market, where they again teach you by telling you which stocks are hot on CNBC. \n\nThey know how to manipulate this information so they always win and ape largely loses. (Loud ape noises) So Prometheus delivers ape the internet and ape learns to coordinate. Ape does what 1% does, only with money ape earned. Divided, ape\u2019s money is worth much less because of inflation. They can\u2019t invest like the 1%. The 1% knows this. This is the way it is intended. But together, the ape has more money than the 1%. Even when the purchasing power is weaker, ape has more of it because of their numbers. \n\nNow ape is manipulating the market through yolos. Ape is learning. Ape likes the stocks. 1% can\u2019t stack the deck like they did, so they\u2019re crying like petulant children and using the one thing they know can stop ape: fear. So they tell us we are gonna crash the market. They tell us ape is creating volatility. The entire system is volatile! But if they\u2019re not the winners, then it\u2019s suddenly unfair. And they tell us they\u2019ll flip the game board over and it\u2019ll be our fault for winning. \n\nTruth is, they still win most of the time. But they want to win all of the time.",

And they hard code the IP addresses for the vast number of malicious Microsoft hosts this crap is uploaded to, so you can't block it via a host file. You need an external firewall. \n\nOnce I have Firefox installed, I use Bing to log searches on \"How do I remove any mention of Bing from Windows\" just as a ritual \"fuck you!\"\n\nUltimately I install Ubuntu on any machine I have the right to.

While the liquidity we have raised has substantially extended our liquidity runway, the new debt we have issued, together with the higher interest rate payments that will be required in the future but have largely been deferred, will substantially increase our leverage and future cash requirements. These future cash requirements, like our deferred rent obligations, will present a challenge to our long-term viability if our operating income does not return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Even then, we believe we will need to engage in discussions with our creditors to substantially reduce our leverage. We expect to continue to explore alternatives that include new-money financing, potentially in connection with converting debt to equity, which would help manage our leverage but would be dilutive to holders of our common stock. We expect we will continue to receive from and discuss proposals with all classes of creditors. These discussions may not result in any agreement on commercially acceptable terms.",

OP is not the VP of Stanley Morgan. But the screenshot was apparently taken by someone who received an email by the VP, most likely an employee of Morgan Stanley. We can't say for sure if OP is the employee or if he got the screenshot from an employee. But in any case it is worth asking what is going on because in case this was coordinated or executed by an employee of Morgan Stanley, we have proof that hedge funds or banks actually use social media to gaslight investors.",

I have visited it before to see what it was about after someone linked it and iirc I did comment there once (maybe twice as part of the same thread) about dollar cost averaging IIRC. But I'm sure if you scan my profile with one of those third party extensions used by mods you'll find that's literally the full extent of my participation on that sub. But yes when I have commented on GME since the first peak, it tends to be negative. \n\n\nI used to work in finance (not at Morgan  Stanley but a similar buldge bracket bank, although I suspect revealing that is going to make you think I'm a shill even more now). I was on multiple teams, the first of which was in middle office Clearing (although OTC Credit and Rates not Equities) so I kinda had an understanding of how the plumbing works behind the scenes for trades. The bulk of my GME related comments, while negative, centered on trying to explain how the system worked with things like T+2, the DTCC, collateral calls, Robinhood getting caught with their pants down, etc. Maybe that could be considered that to be FUD but imo that's just trying to explain the financial supply chain.\n\n\nBy the time I left banking I was working front office OTC Credit and Rates, which if you look at this Anastasia lady's LinkedIn, you'll notice is what she does as well. That's why I said I was less convinced she had anything to do with AMC after looking at her profile. At least when I had basically  that same job, granted at a different bank, we had nothing to do with retail equities. These teams are heavily siloed and don't really overlap across different products. I personally don't see why it would be different at Morgan Stanley. \n\n\nAs for OP, the way I see it is there's two possible reasons they could be receiving an email from her. The first is he works on her team, in which case, I doubt he's involved in a conspiracy with Morgan Stanley for the same reasons I don't think Anastasia is. That also explains why he has a Bloomberg. He's using his work computer (which I imagine is going to get him fired when compliance finds this post). \n\nThe second possibility is he works for one of her clients and that's a marketing email (she is in sales after all, half her job is spamming clients with those emails). I guess that could look worse if he works for a hedgefund, and I don't have first hand experience for how siloed it is on the buy side (the institutional investors side of the industry). From what I've heard online and irl is that it's pretty similar though. Teams that trade interest rate swaps and credit default swaps (his team considering he's receiving an email from her) are different from teams that would be involved with buying/shorting stocks. In this case still, thats why he has Bloomberg access and I imagine their compliance is also going to fire him when they see this post. \n\n\nAs far as whether the post itself is misleading, idk it seemed well sourced and thought out to me. Everything was linked to either an SEC filing or a screenshot from Bloomberg. That being said, I don't really follow AMC, I think this might actually be the first time I've talked about that company on reddit really so I'm not exactly in a position to verify or dispute his claims. Regarding the media, like I said I don't really follow AMC so I'll just take your word regarding FUD over the last 2 days.\n\nEdit: also to add, the reason compliance is going to fire him isn't because he used his Bloomberg to back up a reddit post or that he was posting about AMC in general. It's because sending screenshots outside the firm is a huge no no...for the very reason we're even having this discussion. You might accidentally send info in the background that is price sensitive (and if that email is what others have found regarding Virgin Active, I suspect it is price sensitive information)",

While the liquidity we have raised has substantially extended our liquidity runway, the new debt we have issued, together with the higher interest rate payments that will be required in the future but have largely been deferred, will substantially increase our leverage and future cash requirements. These future cash requirements, like our deferred rent obligations, will present a challenge to our long-term viability if our operating income does not return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Even then, we believe we will need to engage in discussions with our creditors to substantially reduce our leverage. We expect to continue to explore alternatives that include new-money financing, potentially in connection with converting debt to equity, which would help manage our leverage but would be dilutive to holders of our common stock. We expect we will continue to receive from and discuss proposals with all classes of creditors. These discussions may not result in any agreement on commercially acceptable terms.\n\n\nEDIT: I feel like I should respond here to some comments below:\n\n\\- Everything I said is factual. It's all linked to the official SEC docs of AMC or Bloomberg as a reliable source. \n\n\\- Its a fact that share count increased to 450m. its a fact that roughly 50m shares are shorted.. .its a fact that even if you add in all the call options you barely get to any squeeze .. these are all facts\n\n\\- the fact that I have access to a Bloomberg terminal does not make any difference\n\n\\- If you really think I want to drive the share price by posting here.. sorry you are bloody stupid then. AMC trades like 2.5bn every day!!.. Mr bag holder dildo with his 50 shares has no influence lol \n\n\\- yes my account is new. I looked at this once my friends asked me whether to invest in AMC or GME. I know AMC very very very well. I never looked at GME. \n\n\\- I find it irresponsible that unsophisticated people with little money gamble away all their savings by being tricked into a Hoax\n\n\\- I did this post so ppl can get the facts right \n\n&#x200B;\n\n/End of Edit\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been flagging dilution at AMC before and I want to touch on this further in this DD.\n\n# 1. AMC increased its share count from roughly 100m to 450m in the last few month alone.\n\nThis is a link to AMC latest quarterly release:\n\n[https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/0a2146ef-7cb0-43b1-b96f-33c1681e146e.html](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/0a2146ef-7cb0-43b1-b96f-33c1681e146e.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Dilution events taken from latest 8K](https://preview.redd.it/5nhq36y0edm61.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=afb291e963b75de557dcfaafd9d87c951ff24211)\n\n**Lets count just how many shares have been issued:**\n\nFrom the above picture: 15+15+20+200+50+44.4 = 344.4 . this compares to a starting share count of 103.8m so total shares out is now 448m (and that does not include all the restricted stock options management issued to themselves)\n\nWhich I estimate is another 6m.\n\n\uf0e8 Bottom line share count went up by 4.5x\n\n\uf0e8 And this is all float.. no institutional holders.. (Wanda converted there B shares to A shares to sell them)\n\n# 2. Furthermore the company will keep issuing more shares.\n\nThey have another 70m left to issue which will likely be issues in the next days to come.\n\nAnd \u2026 here it comes:\n\nThe company just filed an Annul general meeting to increase the share count by another 500m.\n\nSee this link:\n\n[http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/9f348412-ec88-4159-a092-631da0404d66.html](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/9f348412-ec88-4159-a092-631da0404d66.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMC filing to do another 500m shares](https://preview.redd.it/wul8zvh3edm61.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=c73a842dfabc32da7b9491a837069132414a7baf)\n\n# Operationally it\u2019s a severely struggling business:\n\n\\- The company burned through 125m a month in Q4\n\n\\- That burn will step up to 150m per month in H2 as management has stated at yday call.\n\n\\- They have 1bn of cash on hand but that will go down fast\n\n\\- Debt is now higher then pre corona and there is another 450m of unpaid rent\n\n\\- Share count is 4.5 pre covid .. so today\u2019s share price really means around 48USD compred to pre covid dilution \u2013 pre covid it was trading at 6-8USD\n\n\\- Remember AMC wasn\u2019t even able to generate any cash pre- covid\n\n\\- The stock rally has saved the debt holders because AMC might indeed be able to avoid bankruptcy.. but given the dilution the stock is still effectively worthless\n\nThere is not even that much squeeze potential:\n\n# Lets look at the facts:\n\n# 1. Stocks shorted 55.5m ??\n\nThat is a whopping ;) 12.3% of float\u2026. And compares to 260m shares traded yday.. so to cover all shorts you need about 20% of the daily volume.\n\nStock is liquid to borrow\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fof2wnb7edm61.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=c73dcf2434b9d689a2246eabd1af28f5d0359c98\n\nshort interest\n\n# 2. But what about a gamma squeeze ???\n\nAgain lets look at the facts.\n\nThe open interest in all calls is 1.27m .. against that we have 0.684m puts.\n\nLets totally ignore the puts which have a stable effect on the share price.. lets assume those don\u2019t exist.\n\n1.27m calls are equivalent to still a high number of 127m shares\u2026\n\nMany of these calls are out of the money..\n\nBut hey let's assume ALL the calls end up in the money.\n\nThat is 127m shares.. add that to the 55m shorted and you end up at 237m .. which is still only 50% of float!!\n\nAlso this compares to 1!!!!! Daily volume.. far from critical.\n\nMore realistically assuming a 30% delta and 50% put offset its more an extra 17m shares from calls.\n\nThis is not going to the moon.. The fundamentals are not there.\n\nThe reason why dildos get exited is that they look at outdated statistics about the shares outstanding and think it is sooo highly shorted.. but the fact is it isn\u2019t.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lz5zqgi8edm61.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=c528206d8ff289937b709421c10eeb4114a63ec9\n\nlook at open interest.. taken from bloomberg\n\n# Concluding Remarks:\n\nNow go on and downvote.. I expect nothing else from ignorance.\n\nI still hope some ppl find this post before they make stupid mistakes with their savings.\n\nI am just stating the facts.. so don\u2019t accuse me of lying without presenting any evidence.",

The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future.

They literally ran out of shares and had to buy whatever they needed at whatever price was there. With so much of gme still shorted it's going to take a long time for them to clear it.

But most typically its used for businesses to get and track leads, send out email campaigns and track successes on those campaigns (how many email opens, etc). Typically pretty innocent stuff but all data that is likely getting sold off.\n\nI don't get the phone number input - I've worked with MailChimp a few times before and never really saw a way to do anything with phone numbers on there, but thats potentially a feature I simply missed or is new.\n\nedit: after some google-fu, it doesnt seem like MailChimp has a service to send out campaigns to mobile phones via phone numbers. my guess is that its being collected simply to either A) have some person manually call every person, B) some sort of system to read the value into another system to auto-call people or C) is a scam and they are just collecting to sell or some other nefarious purpose.

In the screenshot below, the Options price rose 650%(900% now) today, on an only 5-6% rise so far in stock price. Volatility is through the roof already (107%).\n\nMeaning, before this post / today, the $12.5 Calls were virtually worthless. Meaning the probability they print was very, very low. The stock hasn't been above $12 in over 3 months. If you bought them before this, Congrats you're on your way to big profit, if you didn't and are considering buying them now, consider how IV works and that if this stalls at all on the way up your options will lose a lot of value. \n\nThere's very little fundamental reasoning behind this company \"squeezing\". OP just thinks it will because investors think it's a shitty buy (40% shorted), and \"people like Grills\". \n\n[It's a Trap](https://i.imgur.com/RQdLR4K.png)\n\nEdit: \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Okay, I also enjoy Loss Porn",

You need to time your exit upon squeeze etc. honestly, if youre up and you have positions, you should get out and try trading for a while before you get on squeezes. They get messy and I dont want you to lose money.\n\nI trade options a lot.

Admittedly I am an inexperienced trader, but I have been doing my best to learn since I fomoed in January. \n\nWhat I have learned so far is how much ambiguity exists in the market, along with speculation based on lack of complete data. Inherently, I distrust HF, so in hindsight, I let myself accept conclusions/DD that I did not validate personally. \n\nI hope earnings go well on Tuesday and hopefully it gives GME a little bit of a catalyst. I plan to close my more expensive positions, and let the positions I have already paid off in gains ride.  \n\nI lurked WSB back in the day, and it wasn\u2019t anything close to what it is now sadly. It\u2019s hard to bring up counter arguments without getting attacked. For what it\u2019s worth, I appreciate your effort to point out some of the inconsistencies with the thesis of others.",

The unrealistic and delusional price points and conspiratorial thinking that the hedge funds are out to keep you down are what\u2019s driving some of us crazy. Big money is profiting off this along with retail (Senvest I think made 60% on GME in February). What you guys are hoping for is a whale to come along and buy a metric fuck ton of ITM calls to send this soaring again, and with premiums being what they are that shit doesn\u2019t feel as likely. \n\nAlways have an exit strategy. If the people you are talking to that are still holding don\u2019t have a realistic exit strategy then you\u2019re in an echo chamber and need to find people with different points of view.

They honestly don\u2019t care which way the stock goes. The volatility and liquidity WSB has provided will make butterfly\u2019s and iron butterfly\u2019s highly profitable with very little down side. Not to mention the many other strategies and instruments that are available to hedge funds but not retail. Retail, on the other hand, will get hammered. They don\u2019t need to misinform or manipulate. The volatility and liquidity provided by retail WSB traders is enough for them to eat your lunch no matter which way GME trades. Funny how that works out huh? And folks here think they\u2019re sticking to the man \ud83e\udd23.\n\nAlso the naked short shares were real. But now it\u2019s reading high simply because of so many trades before settlement. It\u2019s for the same reason you can see a stock with 140% institutional investment. More institutions are reporting than reported sold. In this case the clearing houses can\u2019t settle quick enough to register accurate numbers. \n\nBut one thing is clear, more retail investors will lose money from GME than make it. Hedge funds are totally taking advantage of these unique market conditions that they can profit from with very little risk. When you can go both long and short at the same time combined with options, the sky is the limit. If my broker would let me SELL multi leg options on GME I\u2019d have enough tendies to start a chain of KFC\u2019s! I could sell strategies with zero downside as the volume is so high I could construct options strategies that would totally short change the folks buying the contract. All because the liquidity and volume provided by WSB.\n\nGME is an options sellers dream!! The high demand for shares is not WSB pumping the stock silly!! It\u2019s hedge funds selling a myriad of covered and short multi leg options strategies combined with WSB pumping the stock. Who wins in that scenario? Hint, not retail!\n\nExample: What\u2019s the risk to reward ratio of a butterfly above or below current trading value with a $10 spread? Risk is zero!",

Beta in general is supposed to be measured over a long horizon, as it\u2019s used to do CAPM and other types of portfolio allocation. When GME was drifting downward against a backdrop of a bull market, it demonstrated a low beta because its performance just wasn\u2019t connected to its peers in the market.  For a period of time around the January run-up, it had an inverse correlation with the overall market, which is noteworthy but not necessarily causative.  The strength of the correlation also wasn\u2019t that great (R^2).  The beta figure that is reported by sites like Yahoo never really tell you the important parts, like \u201cover what time frame?\u201d or \u201cwith what predictive strength?\u201d  Extreme example, beta measured over a two-day period around an earning miss could show insane inverse beta\u2014just a function of the price readjustment.\n \nBTW, it\u2019s easy to test this by doing a quick regression on GME and SPY.  The negative coefficient shows up around the January squeeze-ish.  \n \nOn another note, the OP that started this beta hype misunderstood the basic premise.  If you want to add negative beta to your portfolio, pick a stock that has positive beta and short it.  To you, the beta will be effectively negative.  That does not imply that a heavily shorted stock would itself have a negative beta as that poster thought.  In fact, I\u2019d expect a heavily shorted stock to have a low beta, just like GME, as the stock tries to track with its peer group but is undermined or dragged by the shorters.",

        "body": "There\u2019s a lot of misinformation going around WSB right now, and the common knowledge is that hedge funds shorting GME are the source of it. Unfortunately, common knowledge isn\u2019t always correct knowledge. The reality is that much of the disinformation being spread on WSB right now is very pro-GME, and the new crowd here, which consists mostly of greenhorn traders (who don\u2019t really understand how the market functions) is lapping it up. The [people \u2014 600 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/) participating in this disinformation campaign often intentionally reach the wrong conclusions after overloading posts with very technical information that most greenhorn traders do not understand, or even just [make terms up](https://postimg.cc/B8W93Yth) \u2014 [Source \u2014 18.5k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5zoos/gme_how_the_dip_today_was_due_to_etf_shares_being/)\n\nThere are many common tricks they use to positively manipulate sentiment surrounding GME. I wrote about it a bit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m68ybj/comment/gr6asm3?context=3). Unfortunately, that post was deleted by Automod when I edited a YouTube link into the text, and the mod team did not respond to requests to restore the post.\n\nRegardless, I\u2019ve noticed many of the same pro-GME talking points being recycled \u2014 often by brand new accounts that have a post history of begging for karma and posting exclusively about GME. You can love the stock, that\u2019s fine, but if you *really* love the stock, it\u2019s important to know how you\u2019re being misled and lied to by posts that frequently hit the front page. In this thread, I\u2019ll be addressing [this post \u2014 21.1k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m79wdx/why_the_gme_moass_mother_of_all_short_squeezes_is/) specifically, and I\u2019ll also be linking to similar shady posts that parrot the same baseless or misleading claims.\n\n**Claim #1: GME is inversely-correlated with the broader market because the squeeze forces institutions to sell long positions to protect against margin calls**\n\nThere does seem to be *some* correlation between GME and the broader market, but this doesn\u2019t imply causation (or shorts getting squeezed). It\u2019s not uncommon for meme stocks to do well while the rest of the market is selling off. [Exhibit A](https://postimg.cc/PvGJgzYY) \u2014 [Exhibit B](https://postimg.cc/1VpXsnrT) \u2014 notice how RIOT\u2019s peak in 2018 coincides with SPY\u2019s trough? That\u2019s correlation, but not causation. Why does this happen? I can\u2019t say for sure, but my guess is that stocks like this have a lot of volatility, so when funds pull out of the broader market, they place their wealth in these volatile stocks as kind of a \u201cstore\u201d of wealth until the sell-off is finished, at which point they cash out and re-enter the market. Just speculating, though.\n\nWhat I *can* prove, however, is that the claim that the broader market and GME are inversely correlated is **complete bullshit**, and it takes only [the barest, most basic amount of research](https://postimg.cc/jDjfQcXS). Here, I\u2019ve overlayed the S&P 500 with GME. If there were any correlation, you would see GME go down roughly whenever SPY went up, and vice-versa. Not good enough? Think GME ought to be valued as a tech company? [Nasdaq similary shows no correlation](https://postimg.cc/VdgMCpXh). Yes, I know the overlays aren\u2019t perfect, but I\u2019m working on an iPad here \u2014 cut me some slack. Regardless, you can see there is **no correlation**, proving that this part of Bows_N_Hoes post is **bullshit**.\n\nFor the record, I *do* think there was an inverse correlation between GME and the broader market back in February. In my opinion, there genuinely was a threat of system collapse. The IBKR chairman himself admitted that. (Request a link to the vid in comments and I\u2019ll provide. I can\u2019t post it in OP or my post will get whacked). In this case, hedge funds likely *did* have to sell some of their positions to free up liquidity so that they could cover or protect their shorts. This led to the broader market falling while GME squoze. As demonstrated, this correlation no longer exists.\n\nNote: This claim is about inverse correlation is the same as [another unfounded claim \u2014 4.4k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6if56/the_mythical_unicorn_aka_extremely_abnormal/) that hit the front page of WSB, and which one of WSB\u2019s mods similarly dismantled.\n\n**Claim 2: The illegal practice of naked short selling is causing the stock to show over 140% ownership**\n\nThe post claims that short shares are being invented out of thin air and sold on the market. While this is theoretically possible (but illegal!), this is pure speculation. So how then, might you ask, can a stock display over 100% ownership? When stocks are shorted, they are *borrowed* from someone who owns the stock, and then sold. Now, the same shares can be lent from one person to another to another. All of the entities borrowind the stock must report ownership of the stock. So, imagine it this way: I lend my dildo to my friend, and then *he* lends that dildo to *his* friend. I would report owning that dildo, my friend would report owning that dildo (albeit temporarily) and *his* friend would report owning that dildo. So you see how one single dildo can become three? [Investopedia even has an article about this](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp ). The same thing is happening to GME, and any claims that higher than 100% institutional ownership being indicative of the illegal practice of short selling is pure speculation, of which no one has yet provided proof.\n\n**Claim #3: No seriously, these \u201csynthetic shares\u201d are real, and are being sold back and forth on the market place!**\n\nDo you know what you get when you Google \u201csynthetic shares\u201d? A bunch of [Indian biomed companies](https://postimg.cc/FYc2syMD) with \u201csynthetic\u201d in their company name. Do you know what happens when you control for these Indian biomed companies?  You get results that are [basically nothing](https://postimg.cc/xcBw2x4X). If \u201csynthetic shares\u201d were a real phenomenon, you wouldn\u2019t have to go digging through this many foreign small-cap biomed companies to find any information about it. And before anyone chimes in, snthetic call options and put options *are* real, but those are **very** different from what OP is claiming.\n\n**Claim #4: Hedge funds are totally getting squeezed by GME\u2019s rise!**\n\nPeople who make this claim often resort to proving it by:\n\n* using complex calculations\n\n* depend on incomplete data\n\n* make suppositions\n\n* discard any data that disproves their claims\n\n[Source \u2014 600 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/)\n\nHowever, we don\u2019t need to do any logical loop-de-loops to prove that GMe doesn\u2019t have an exceptionally high level of short interest. In fact, all we have to do is go to [an old fan favorite of WSB](https://isthesqueezesquoze.com/) to see the true story laid out for us in a very clear, concise argument.\n\nHere, we have a few important metrics:\n\n*Short interest \u2014 16% \u2014 the amount of shares short as a percentage of the float \u2014 while 16% is atypically high, it\u2019s nowhere *near* the purported 100-350% [some suspicious people](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/) with one-month old accounts are shilling.\n\n* Borrow rate \u2014 0.6% \u2014 particularly low. Borrow rates \u2014 that is, the rate people are paid to lend out the stock on a yearly basis \u2014 go up a lot the more a stock is shorted. For reference, RKT was at 20% a few weeks ago.\n\n* Borrow availability \u2014 300,000 shares \u2014 the most heavily shorted stocks often appear as \u201cno shares available for shorting\u201d for a long time \u2014 *days, even* \u2014 since their shares are so in demand to borrow and sell short.\n\nSo there you have it. Three very simple, easy metrics you can use to verify that the stock is not as heavily shorted as some people want you to believe. To believe otherwise would mean you would have to buy in to conspiracies about a wide-ranging collaboration between various market participants and entities with differing aims, ethics, and stakes, involving thousands of people, and all to cover up the true short rate of just *one* stock. [Occam\u2019s Razor, y\u2019all](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNow you have to ask yourself \u2014 do you like the *stock* or do you like the *hype*? Because if it\u2019s the former, then you should not be supporting the people continually spreading disinformation about it. If it\u2019s the latter, then have fun on this wild ride, but don\u2019t lie or support lying to your fellow WSBers. It\u2019s immoral,  and it;s not cute when somekne points out these lies and incosistencies and all you can say is \u201ctl;dr, buying more\u201d.",

Buy long and hold and there\u2019s no further capital requirements.  You only win or lose when you sell or a company goes bankrupt.\n\nYou can\u2019t short and hold without further capital requirements when the price substantially rises.  Besides the interest paid to short, if you get caught in the squeeze you\u2019d either need to cover the capital requirements to maintain the short or be forced to buy at market price.  Kind of like buying long on margin, except your capital requirements are limited to 2x your buy price (price goes from whatever you bought it from to zero).  With a short, your capital requirements if the price goes up are unlimited, and your gains are limited to 2x your buy price.\n\nIf you placed a short now and had 30x+ in further liquidity behind it you might weather a squeeze and make money on the other side.  But nobody does that.  You don\u2019t hold 30x+ liquidity for a possible 2x gain and a 30x+ loss.\n\nEdit:  I was replying to a downvoted post, but in true retard fashion appear to have drunk replied to the OP.

Let me be clear, I'm about to describe a hypothetical situation, this is purely my own theory and is not to be considered as factual or confirmed in any way.  Saying that, I would love to see an investigation.  Here goes my hypothetical:\n\nIs it possible that Melvin Capital only naked shorted some of their GME positions, and that Citadel LLC (the hedge fund) is actually the supplier of a significant portion of borrowed shares that Melvin Capital shorted?  GME stock is now very valuable and Citadel LLC would have a vested interest in Melvin Capital buying back those shares and returning them to Citadel LLC in this scenario.  This would explain why Citadel LLC provided Melvin Capital with a cash injection to help them buy back its shares.  Demand for GME is high due to WSB, and Citadel LLC in this scenario would stand to make a fortune selling it's shares to hungry retail traders.  If Melvin Capital went bankrupt, Citadel LLC (if it indeed was the supplier of some Melvin Capital GME shorted shares) could not recoup the majority of this highly profitable stock.  It further stands to reason in this hypothetical, that Citadel Securities (a Citadel LLC subsidiary which is Robinhood Financial LLC's largest trading partner, accounting for a significant portion of Robinhood's trading revenues) would pressure Robinhood to prevent its customers from buying GME shares and force sell those purchases made on margin.  This would deflate the price on GME allowing Citadel LLC to recoup more  shares from Melvin Capital to sell to retail investors.  In this, again, completely hypothetical scenario; once Citadel LLC is back in possession of it's GME shares, poof!  The restrictions on Robinhood's platform would be lifted and Citadel LLC would be sitting on goldmine.\n\nThe only problem with this completely unconfirmed scenario, is that there is meant to be a business separation firewall between Citadel Securities and its parent company Citadel LLC.  The two businesses are legally required to act as two completely separate companies.  Any sharing of information between the two regarding their positions and strategy would be considered a conflict of interest to the fair market.  I mean that would be highly illegal market manipulation, so of course that wouldn't happen.\n\nBut what do I know? I eat \ud83d\udd8ds and lick \ud83e\ude9fs",

Robinhood caves to pressure as Citadel Securities is 35% of it's revenue.  Once Citadel has GME back, restrictions are lifted and we're buying GME from Citadel.  Solution? Buy all GME so Citadel can't get it back and we deny Citadel as we \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c",

As we also know, Melvin got an emergency cash infusion of $2.75 billion last Monday from Citadel and Point72 to help them with their GME shorts. \n\nOn a post the other day someone sent the following helpful [link with positions hedge funds have](https://hedgefollow.com/stocks/GME).  Did a search for GME and at the bottom of the Top 20 hedge funds that own GME is Citadel With 111.8k shares which is only .01% of their portfolio.  It says their position is new but believe this list is as of Q4 2020.  This is confusing me as this position contradicts their support of Melvin which may be going bankrupt if we have our way.  Unless they are holding to hedge the support of Citadel?   Any thoughts on this?  I want to see both Melvin and Citadel go bankrupt and hate to see one of them profit off GME mooning.\n\nDoes anyone have an updated list of hedge fund positions or a list of what stocks hedge funds are shorting?\n\nTLDR, Why does Citadel have a long position in GME?  I don\u2019t want to see them make a dime off of GME mooning.  \n\nF*ck Melvin! F*ck Citadel! F*ck Shitron! F*ck Robinhood!  They\u2019ve made this personal and I\u2019m not selling till one of them goes bankrupt!  Hold the F*ckin Line!",

GME has developed a loyal following of believers since early 2020. The squeeze depends on people holding, which is more likely with GME.\n\n\ud83c\udf7f still has more shares they're allowed to offer if they want to take advantage of today's action (they issued yesterday when it was only $4-5).\n\nGME the short squeeze is already imminent as a result of major gamma squeezes getting it to where it is.\n\nAll that said, I do think \ud83c\udf7f still has potential. But GME, in my opinion, is almost a sure thing as this point to explode Friday and/or Monday.\n\nI own 15 total call options and 35 shares in \ud83c\udf7f. I took some profit out of it today to take advantage of discounts across the market on other positions I'm in (mainly Lucid).\n\nThe problem is comparing \ud83c\udf7f, which could very well fizzle out tomorrow, to GME, which would require a miracle at this point to backtrack before the squeeze really happens.

The beauty of stocks is that you can own more than one.\n\nAMC opened today at 4x the price, after trending up for days. It bounced around half its ATH of $35, before closing at 300% gain for the day.\n\nGME hit $380 today, up six times its all time high of $63. The current GME price scares away non-autist retail investors, and at that price, new buyers will be expending multiples more capital for the same upward pressure.\n\nIf you don't believe me, look at the numbers. As GME is hitting mainstream and is the big hotness on this sub, AMC also outperformed GME by 165% by close today.\n\nAlso, #saveAMC is already trending as it gains traction across social media. People are actively looking for a new GME they feel they missed the boat on.\n\nhttps://www.thestreet.com/investing/amc-shares-outerspace\n\nhttps://twitter.com/reddittrading/status/1354479260363354117\n\nDespite how low the price already was, it has a record number of shorts: over 38 million. This means another short squeeze isn't just on the menu - it's already starting. It's the third most shorted stock out there, despite its clearly viable future. This doesn't distract from GME's slaughter of hedge funds because it's the next wave of their an hero.\n\nhttps://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/\n\nhttps://highshortinterest.com/\n\nAMC has raised a billion dollars to weather out coronavirus, amid an ongoing \"Safe & Clean\" push. Some studios like WB are moving to parallel releases on HBO Max, but AMC is already throwing out deals to get people in the door. Meanwhile, Hollywood has been sitting on blockbusters after watching Tenet and WW1984 eat shit on streaming:\n\nhttps://variety.com/2021/film/global/amc-raises-debt-financing-1234891278/\n\nhttps://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean\n\nhttps://screenrant.com/tenet-box-office-failure-warner-bros-2021-movies-impact/\n\nTheir debt/equity ratio has also been trending positively, even as coronavirus has intensified. Just a return to the mean suggests ridiculous gain, even ignoring the likelihood of pent-up demand. AMC has legs not just for the next week, but for the next few quarters.\n\nhttps://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMC/amc-entertainment-holdings/debt-equity-ratio\n\nCoronavirus, the main cause for AMC's big downturn, is on the way out as vaccines will be available to all by spring, just ahead of summer blockbuster season.\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-biden-anyone-spring/\n\nIn the long term, after hedge fund shorters lose their ass on GME, brick and mortar game stores will have less of a future, with or without coronavirus. It's easier to digitally download games, and hardware can be bought online and received the next day from any number of retailers. There's no way to mount a 20 foot screen in your house. Unless, of course, you buy AMC stock now.\n\nEdit: lol\n\n> Hi!\n\n> You have been added to r/ControversialClub because this post of yours from r/wallstreetbets was one of the most controversial posts of the last hour on all of Reddit!

He gets it at a good price, about 100k.  Friend sees his new house, and falls in love with it, and offers to buy it.  Guy tells him fine, he'll sell it to him for 150k.  Well a week later Guy has seller's remorse, so he finds Friend and asks if he can buy the house back.  Friend tells him sure, but that he needs to make a profit for it to be worthwhile, so he tells Guy that he can buy it back for 200k.  Well this keeps going on between the two men for months, until one day Friend goes to see Guy to buy the house back from him.  When he makes an offer, Guy tells him sorry, but that a another man offered 1.5 million for it and he sold it off.  Friend is incredulous, and says, \"What?!  You got rid of it?!  But it was making us both so much money!\"",

Also, there is some anomalies because of the historic volatility in the Options Market that causes Options to not change price in the way that would be expected, allowing for Hedge Funds to move in and arb those anomalies, which may include buying shares as well. \n\nHonestly, I don't really care if you follow my advice or not, but you seriously need to be careful here, it will be very hard to squeeze again the way that occured last week. The blow off top squeeze to $1000 plus was likely screwed up by the broker limitations, giving a window for them to escape. You tanked Melvin for 53% - I can PROMISE you, they are no longer in this fucking position, and may have played in a different way. There has also been a massive opportunity here for hedge funds without the targeted exposures to take on the upside of these trades - but the one difference is THEY WILL SELL.

It was 17m alone after hours on Thurs.\n\nNow there are 9,999 other Funds looking at retail holders and trying to figure out how to separate you from any gains you have made.\n\nI have been through 2 iterations of this sub.  2013 and 2020 Pandemic.\n\nThis level of group think is unprecedented and I have no doubt Reddit will shut us down when the reports of total financial ruin come in and make media headlines.\n\nWe have so many invested in GME.

Amirite?\n\nEdit:  *Here is how we know this is going tits up* \n\n- The sub is not considering that Melvin were destroyed by other Funds.  Less than 1% are actively looking at institutions and thinking \"how will they attack my gains\"?\n- The distractions are not being attributed to anything other than Citadel.  Not state sponsored. Not other funds.  It all one homogenous enemy in the subs eyes\n- We have progressed to the QAnon part of our agenda. Yep, the shares are counterfeit and (insert deity) will reveal it ALL at (insert date).  Keep holding! It will be blown open! \n- The sub used to be intelligent people pretending to be dumb..and it declined bit by bit but now it is a festering cesspool of monkeys throwing shit and piss at each other and upvoting magic chants and spells.\n- Most importantly, the monkeys **refuse** to believe the shorts have covered even though volumes last week were 700m.   We lost, the clearing houses and brokers fucked us.  The melt up to $450+ was the squeeze.",

If they can\u2019t deliver the share (because it doesn\u2019t exist) within 3 days, then this gets reported as a \u201cfailure to deliver\u201d. Now, the SEC may look past a few of these because floats do happen, but too many and the SEC is obligated to open an investigation.\n___\n>If Vanguard and Fidelity become the only source for Redditors to buy from, then they can keep moving the doomsday clock forward.\n\n___\n\n>But, this can\u2019t be continued indefinitely.

The only thing that matters is the price of GME when these hedge fucks need to cover their short positions. And let me tell you, that number will be set by us retail investors. Every fucking day will not matter as long as people hold. Tbh Idc if these small paper hand investors sell right now because somebody out there will just buy it back when the levels keep dipping. Thats another thing thats so dumb on the hedge fuck side. They are literally tanking the numbers and giving it out at a discount. I'm pretty sure they are trying to scare as much people into selling and then when they feel like the payoff of delaying the covering of their shorts has reached it's peak they will execute it and pay out the ultimate price that we'll be setting. They are hoping it'll only be in the 700-1k range, it realistically might be around those levels or at least most of the activity will be around those levels but it can be a lot higher if people just keep holding.",

With all the free press Gamestop has gotten and will continue to get, at the absolute minimum this is a $40 stock. \nSo those worried about losing it all, just know this stock is not settling below $40 even if everyone pulls out. Even if it goes below, its going right back over $40 as smart money buys the dip. Now maybe that will change a year or more out if Cohen cant transition this company into the digital marketplace but for this year, this stock has a lot of potential to succeed even after the squeeze.\nSo realistic worse case scenario is you lose 2/3 of the current share value. Best case scenario which we all know is VERY realistic, is that this thing rockets over $1000. Its a once in a lifetime opportunity for a slingshot past Mars! \nPlus, you can stick it to these hedge funds, corrupt businesses, media companies and politicians backing the hedge funds. \n\nI dont know what im taking about, but neither do the people saying this will go back below $20. Hedge funds all over shorted this company initially when it was below $25 and they wont recoup that. No chance. This company has potential to succeed even past the squeeze, dont forget that when making your personal risk analysis",

Because it\u2019s not.\n\nWe also know they\u2019re down BAD. Why?\nBecause they\u2019re attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so.\n\nSo let\u2019s see what tactics they are using:\n\n**Short ladder attacks**:\n\nWhat is a short ladder attack? \nThe big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves. There is little to no volume on those trades, and since no one can buy, it \"looks\" like the stock is plummeting. It\u2019s only effective if we would sell. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ay2s/short_ladder_attack_explained/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall_street_plan_trying_to_psychologically_scare/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nJust look at the volume.

Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD. Obvious shills. There\u2019s tons of them. Always new, or old accounts that suddenly post again. All those people came in just in time when the short ladder attacks started, just to make it look like people are panic selling and convince us to sell:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahqex/notice_the_two_obvious_melvin_employees_time_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\n**Manipulating the Media**: \n\nHere are some News channels caught lying / manipulating the market: (SEC if you read this...)\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8n7o/fake_news/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6e16/cnn_back_off_this_is_a_lie_literally_a_5_second/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9runf/the_silver_squeeze_is_a_hedgefund_coordinated/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8x7g/bloomberg_now_insisting_gme_is_old_news_ha/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\n\nNow let\u2019s get some clarification on **SILVER:**\n\nThere is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver. People don\u2019t seem to realize 3 things:\n\n1. **Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.** GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO)\u00a0\n2. The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make.\u00a0\n3. The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that\u2019s why they\u2019re pushing this narrative in the media.\u00a0\n\nSLV inverting GME: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nThe amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.\n\n**IF** you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that\u2019s just my retard opinion. \n\n**SILVER ISN\u2019T \u201cREDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY\u201c.** You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.\n\nSilver squeeze not happening links: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1o04/there_is_no_silver_short_squeeze_happening_none/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1xhf/guess_who_owns_tonnes_of_slv_options_fuck_citadel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9runf/the_silver_squeeze_is_a_hedgefund_coordinated/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nWell. Let\u2019s see to what extend they fucked up exactly:\u00a0\n\n**Short Version:**\nThe short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails\u2013to\u2013deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.\n\nThere are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.\n\nOn top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options \u2013 both ITM and OTM).  \n\nOnce you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.\n\nLong version here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\n**At these levels it\u2019s NOT about the price, it\u2019s about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession. That\u2019s why they want you to sell so bad.**\n\n\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\n\nLast but not least I\u2019m holding because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I\u2019m holding because I hope to see a better future and I\u2019m holding for all you out there. \nTo the Moon or zero. \n\n\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d APES. STRONG. TOGETHER. \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\n\nDisclaimer: \nThis is not financial advice, I\u2019m literally an ape. I just like the stock. Do your own DD and avoid the fake new and/or resurrected accounts here and the manipulative Media.\n\nEdit: wanted to post a few new posts but it seems like I\u2019m shadow banned. No one can see my posts. \nI don\u2019t know if I got caught in some kind of spam filter.\nu/only1parkjisung can a mod confirm this?"

I believe that this action is in direct response to pressure Robinhood Financial felt from its institutional partners (namely CITADEL), and is in no way representative of a free or legitimate market. While there is inherent risk to investments of all types, Robinhood's removal of the ability to purchase a security/option, and only permitting the sale of a security/option, AFTER allowing the purchasing of such security/option no less than 24 hours ago, constitutes fraud. See clause 13 of FIRNA's prohibited behavior below: \n\n\"13. Using manipulative, deceptive or other fraudulent methods to effect a transaction in, or induce the purchase or sale of, a security.\" ([https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/choosing-investment-professional/prohibited-conduct](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/choosing-investment-professional/prohibited-conduct))\n\nRobinhood Financial's fraud comes in the form of:\n\nA. Deliberately, artificially, and successfully reversing a free market trend by halting the additional purchase of a commodity while allowing the sale of the same commodity\n\nB. Deliberately and arbitrarily affecting the supply of a tradable commodity by prohibiting its purchase in direct response to a market trend. \n\nC. Deliberately and fraudulently encouraging the sale of a commodity, thus directly affecting the demand for such commodity.\n\nD. Colluding and/or being influenced by 3rd party institutional firms to reverse free market trends in attempt to prevent financial loss due to short positions against the tickers GME, AMC, BB, NOK",

They sell data to Citadel LLC who has recently bailed out Melvin Capital Management LP who was heavily shorting the stock. This is a conflict of Interest.

We are already required to acknowledge the inherent risk in the market before purchasing securities. This may have been done to protect people, but it was not the retail investors. A door that only swings one way for retail investors is not a protection, it's attempted incitement of a panic. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price.",

Robinhood has financial ties to Citadel Capital Solutions, a firm that took a financial interest in Melvin Capital as they were losing money on a reckless and over crowded short trade position on GameStop stock. It is my belief that this lockout on specific stocks is directly related to the financial positions their partners have on these stocks, and I can see it as nothing other than blatant market manipulation for personal gain, at the expense of individual retail investors. \n\nI am immediately closing my account with Robinhood, but I am infuriated by the actions taken by the company and strongly suspect that in this process, they have engaged in significant illegal activity through the following:\n\nIntentional and willful conduct designed to defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price and intentional interference with the free forces of supply and demand. \n\nTaking actions that affect the integrity of the market place and prevent price setting by the unimpeded collective judgement of buyers and sellers.",

GME was placed in a \"reduce only\" state, where positions could be exited, but additional shares could not be purchased.\n\nIn addition to this being a gross violation of free market principles, this is also a violation of my rights as a call option holder, as I can no longer exercise my options.\n\nAs defined by them (and understood by the industry at large):\n\n\"Buying to open an options position means that you\u2019re purchasing the contract. You\u2019re the owner, and have the right to place an order to sell the contract back into the market, to exercise the contract, or to let it expire.\"\n\n\\- [https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/options-knowledge-center/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/options-knowledge-center/)\n\nSince their restriction, I can no longer exercise my legally-purchase options, which I maintain is a violation of my options contract.\n\nI believe this was done to manipulate the market at the behest of the firms Robinhood uses to actually execute trades, but that is just my theory.\n\nWhat I do know is that they sold me options contracts with \"the right\" to exercise them, but are now preventing me from doing so.

(Kudos to [Similar lawsuit](https://www.classaction.org/media/taaffe-et-al-v-robinhood-markets-inc-et-al-amended.pdf))\n\nFor today, we are being damaged by not being able to access the markets and buy more shares (which may be market manipulation under [7 USC \u00a79(3)](https://www.classaction.org/media/taaffe-et-al-v-robinhood-markets-inc-et-al-amended.pdf) or [15 USC \u00a778i(a)(2)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78i) since they are artificially affecting demand for multiple securities). Under this part, Robinhood would likely be liable for any profits we could have made by buying more stocks today or, if the price collapses, the losses we took that could have been prevented by large-scale share purchases.\n\nEdit: In discovery we could probably subpoena their corporate communications for the past few days (emails, call logs, etc.) to see if there is any conspiracy to commit market manipulation between RH and any other entities.\n\n(Note: I am not a lawyer).",

You retards do as you wish, feel free to join if you want. Hell, use it as a backup in case something happens to WSB, I don't give a fuck\n\nEdit: Stop giving me these beautiful awards you retards, use the money on GME. \n\nThis is the way. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e.

I have 17.7k liquid money in my TD. Bought 15 shares @327. Waiting for another dip to yolo 12.7k into the rest. I have 18 shares holding on RH with average cost of $112. 1000EOD Boys. Fuck the shorts, fuck the establishment. Melvin and friends can suck my fat diamond encrusted cock. Don't forget to leave RH a nice review on the app store thanking them for your gains\n\nEdit 3: I convinced my mother to yolo her stocks into GME early on @90. She still continues to add onto it and as of now she holds 147+ shares and is profiting well over 60k. I don't know what her cost average currently sits at but if my mother can \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e then so can you. She's more diamond-handed than me. Do your part brothers. We'll all be feasting on tendies from our golden plates and washing it down with Shitron tears as we wipe our asses with Melvin bucks by end of next week.\n\nEdit 4: I can't believe how much this is blowing up. I wasn't expecting it. But while I have the spotlight, I just wanted to thank every single one of you from the bottom of my heart. You tards have done absolute wonders for the community and started a financial revolution fueled by memes and autism.\n I read all these stories about how this community has helped people pay off their debts, care for sick loved ones, allowed people to give back to their local communities, and so much more. You guys are the true unsung heroes of this generation and are some of the most wholesome degenerates i've ever seen. This fight isn't about just tendies anymore, its about justice and equality, it's about sticking it to the corporate elites who run the world. Don't let these greedy scumbags take what's rightfully yours, for too long the little guy has been pushed and shoved around but now it's our time to shine. Keep up the good fight and don't back down. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e for days boys, WE WILL NOT STOP UNTIL WE SEE ELON SHOOT A GME THEMED ROCKET FILLED WITH THE BURNT ASHES OF THESE BASTARDS TO MARS.

POWER TO THE PLAYERS!\n\nEDIT 5: Stop spamming me with awards and upvotes, you retards are crashing my inbox! Put forth all this glorious energy into GME.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: GME to 1,000 EOD, GME 5000 EONW.

I mean, do people still get paid for their shares? Does the squeeze never happen, as they slowly cover their shorts with fake shares over time? What\u2019s the endgame here aside from the hedges (hopefully) getting fucked by the SEC and (hopefully) going to prison? I can\u2019t buy Lambos with morality feel-good points. Do we see $1k/share from this?\n\nI hate to say it boys and girls, but this situation feels like a shell of what it was 2-3 weeks ago. I think the squeeze got too much attention and the suits had time to coordinate and react. I\u2019m not saying a squeeze won\u2019t happen, but I think the lengths they\u2019ll go to in order to prevent it are much greater than anticipated. I actually take the news of Robinhood\u2019s loosening of buying restrictions as a bad sign. I feel like a lot of shorts have covered. Just my opinion. Hope I\u2019m wrong. The billboards were a neat thing though. I\u2019m still going to hold the shares I have left, because it is nice being a part of this. But I feel that the biggest gains have been gotten.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve gotten THREE replies on this comment and each time I go to view/read them they\u2019re gone.

You will be charged for using Robinhood Gold at the beginning of every 30 day period. **In the event You wish to downgrade from Robinhood Gold to Robinhood Instant, You will be able to do that within the Robinhood app. If at any time You wish to downgrade from Robinhood Gold to a regular margin account that is charged on an interest basis only, or a cash account, You will be able to do so by contacting customer service.** You understand that Robinhood Financial may alter the monthly fee and add and/or remove features of Robinhood Gold at any time and in its sole discretion, and will provide You 30 days advance written notice of any changes to its fee structure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRobinhood Financial offers three types of accounts, each designed to suit your investing needs.\n\n## Robinhood Instant\n\nWhen you sign up for a new account, you\u2019ll automatically start with a Robinhood Instant account, which is a margin account. This means you\u2019ll have access to [**instant deposits**](https://robinhood.com/support/articles/360001213883/deposit-money-into-your-robinhood-account/) and extended-hours trading. You also won\u2019t have to wait for your [**funds to process**](https://robinhood.com/support/articles/360001226946/settlement-and-buying-power/) when you sell stocks or make a deposit (up to $1,000).\n\n## Robinhood Gold\n\nA [**Robinhood Gold**](https://robinhood.com/support/my-account-and-login/robinhood-gold/) account is like a Robinhood Instant account, but gives you access to more buying power and larger instant deposits.\n\n## Robinhood Cash\n\nA Robinhood Cash account allows you to place commission-free trades during the standard and extended-hours trading sessions. You won\u2019t have access to instant deposits or instant settlements. You can [**downgrade**](https://robinhood.com/support/articles/360001214603/downgrading-from-gold/) to a Cash account from an Instant or Gold account at anytime.\n\n\\-\n\nThe downgrade page is 404 error\u2019d out. WOW.\n\nThey automatically make all RH accounts margin by giving you access to $1000 instant transfer. All accounts are margin accounts and the shares are loaned out. They say contact them to downgrade, but the page is 404\u2019d out, I think this is the true reason why RH didn\u2019t shut down margin and chose to restrict share purchases. They need to keep loaning our shares to the shorts. The shorts NEED shares from RH to fund their attack. Crazy how much they screw us.\n\nEdit: This seems to be the form that we have to use to turn into a cash account. They make it extremely difficult to turn this off. This is the way.

The Division concludes that the benefits to regulatory and public uses of information from Real-Time Short Position Reporting are likely to be modest. In particular, the Division believes that Real-Time Short Position Reporting and Transaction Marking would provide regulators with little additional information than would already be available from the CAT. However, the Division concludes that the implementation and compliance costs, which could include updating or building a system to collect short position reports, are likely to be significant, even if the information is provided to regulators only. Implementing the CAT will enable the Commission to reassess the extent of any additional benefits that may be derived from requiring Real-Time Short Position Reporting and Transaction Marking, and the costs of any additional infrastructure needed to collect such information. Finally, the Division concludes that a voluntary pilot in Transaction Marking is unlikely to be of much utility. While this report concludes that the short sale reporting regimes studied are unlikely to be cost-effective, the analysis contained in this report should still provide valuable insight to potential future rulemaking regarding short sale disclosure.\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/files/short-sale-position-and-transaction-reporting%2C0.pdf, pg. 114-115",

The early shorts most likely used these to exit. New shorts have been piling in as this ramped up way too quickly, and have made an absolute fortune. With the option chain continually getting bumped up, there was no shortage of room for a MM to generate a naked call, sell to a hedge (not through the market, directly), and use that to \"close out\" the short position.\n\nThey restricted buying so there was no liquidity run. They know the numbers held by retail, which were borrowable and which weren't. They also knew how many they could borrow from institutions or get them to pop free if need be. Once momentum had been blunted and the gamma squeeze prevented, now it became a game of emotionally wear down retail. They knew exactly where we stood Friday and where they did, and they moved with asymmetric knowledge. Retail was stymied longer than necessary, but now is done just to keep a safety valve on it. The option chain is too large now to get a gamma squeeze, so that risk is off the table.\n\nI think they've abandoned plan A of short GME into bankruptcy and now are in the mode of make some profit and get out of the play and leave the evidence so murky and obfuscated that it would take a smart and dedicated investigator (which there aren't any) and a massive amount of congressional pressure changing laws to force the information to rise. And even then, most of the trail will be punted offshore through multiple channels to make it almost impossible.\n\nThe only real hope for change on this, is that a whistleblower from one of the hedge funds comes forward (and I wouldn't count on this).",

They merely show the number of failures to deliver as a snapshot on that specific day.\n\nI haven't been able to verify whether this is the case, but if it is then they were never above 800,000 failures to deliver in one day (not that I'm saying that is a low number).\n\nDoes anyone less retarded than me know if this is correct or not?",

There is far more nefarious shit at play.**\n\nSo this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.\n\nI started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.\n\nWhat was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.\n\nHaving spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf\n\nIn it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:\n\n\"Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A\u2019s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer\u2019s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as \u201creset transactions,\u201d in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm\u2019s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.\"\n\nIt's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.\n\nI 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.\n\nI am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.\n\nMore DD: https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n\nNot a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner\n\nEDIT: Ok, so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up:\n\n* The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively. So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million. What I'm doing is summing all the *debits* to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range. This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts\n\n* I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock. However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor. Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about ~10M. We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME.\n\n* My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect, I got mixed around when I wrote this initially. The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was ~80%. The 120 figure for S3 was correct. \n\n* Please checkout the linked DD - it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can. \n\n* Share this post and the related DD. We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word. \n\n* I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow. Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening.\n\n\nIf I take an L to 0, I take an L to 0. I don't invest what I can't lose. But you can bet your ass I'll be holding till this blows open.\n\nWE LIKE THE STOCK \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udd90\ufe0f"

One APE preferred equity unit represents 1/100th of the underlying preferred stock with regards to voting and economic privilege's.\n\nSo basically, the underlying preferred stock, of which 10,000,000 of were issued, is worth 100x that of an APE unit/the common AMC stock. And guess, what, it's not even listed. They basically have just as many votes as all of retail in both AMC and APE combined due to these 10,000,000 preferred shares that they issued.\n\nSure they need a vote to convert APE into class-a common stock, but retail are not the only ones voting. This is sneaky by AMC, they won't mention the 10,000,000 shares they issued and nobody is talking about this.\n\nHere are some quotes from the filing:\n\n\"The AMC Board is authorized, without further approval, to establish, one or more series of preferred stock...\"\n\n\"On August 4, 2022, the Company filed a Certificate of Designations with the Secretary of the State of Delaware designation 10,000,000 shares of the Company's authorized preferred stock as Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock..\"\n\n\"The issuance of our preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the trading price of our commonstock, restricting dividends on our capital stock, diluting the voting power of our common stock...\"\n\nEdit: Use your brains people, they issued 10mil preferred shares, and they aren't being listed. Who do you think owns these shares? Why do you think these preferred shares have such insane voting privileges, when preferred shares usually have NO voting privileges? Why do you think they issued 10,000,000? Is it because that number is basically exactly how many shares they would need to issue in order to match the 1 billion shares that will be in circulation (of APE and AMC)? Remember, the preferred shares have the voting power of APE x 100. 10,000,000 x 100 is what?? 1 billion. Hm. What a crazy coincidence",

It eventually got to $11, but we may not see that unless other large downward market trends occur at the same time. This stock drops with the S&P and all the major indexes and a drop may be coming after the CPI numbers (high uncertainty if the numbers come out great and if bad then inflation is still a major problem).

I am not early, but others are seemingly stupid giving us the chance to grab puts on the cheap after news which should have tanked the stock price\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nPOST BEGIN: \n\nAs most of us know AMC had earnings on thursday after hours. It was a sought after earnings as AA had been hinting to something big happening, a \u201cpounce\u201d some might say. What this proved to be was a Preferred stock dividend with the ticker $APE (lol). Most people were let down by this, some were excited, but if you look under the hood it is insane how the AMC stock price as of today ended the day up over 18 % and you might think how the fuck did that happen? Earnings sucked balls!  AMC had a shitton of [FTDs due](https://stocksera.pythonanywhere.com/ticker/failure_to_deliver/?quote=AMC) this week as can be seen below, but thats not important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMC Failure to delivers due last week](https://preview.redd.it/mxehqxv44ag91.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1bcb882183c29e836484ba4db7642f1de9364af)\n\nLast year AMC sought shareholder approval for an issuance of an additional 25 million shares to raise cash, but shareholders dissapproved of this as the apes had gotten tired of getting diluted. With AMCs current cash burn rate and their deferred rent payments at the time they did not have a lot of runway left before an inevitable bankruptcy unless they drastically improved their business. The most recent quarter AMC posted a loss to the tune of 121.6 million $, no share dilution approved still, but in comes AA with \u201cthe pounce\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h3j29n094ag91.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=59d214161b1c4ad120a9bd5cc0628cae63403045\n\nWhat this pounce actually turned out to be was a big middle finger to all the investors who disapproved of their requested 25 million share dilution last year. He did not only find a way to get this dilution without shareholder approval. He did not double down, not quadruple down but 100x double down by issuing a new stock which have the exact same voting rights as AMC common stock on the conversion from APE to AMC (lol).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i2nsjn4b4ag91.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=036c24175ab6380e1f0217c858fe7eb1eb7b6eed\n\nThis new ticker which we all know as $APE will give AA and the C-suite the ability to dilute it up to 4.5 billion shares after it has started trading on the NYSE. AA says black on white this was his plan B if investors didnt approve of a dilution (He always finds a way to dilute ;) )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c9rqlw1c4ag91.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=b85d3ade469cfc0f2a1962658407c7b640416510\n\nHe is also no stranger to dilution. Through the late parts of 2021 and first half of 2021 he diluted like his life depended on it as we see in the image below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wynx9sd4ag91.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3b7471f7e02b022634b519182b862a4e2e456a1\n\nSome might say \u201cbut the APE dilution doesn\u2019t matter as AMC wont be diluted so my shares should retain their value\u201d. This is wrong because the $APE shares have literally all the properties AMC have when it comes to the vote for conversion. The \"vote for conversion\" if passed would make it so that one share of APE will be convertable into 1 common share of AMC. And if that vote passes 1 share of ape is identical to 1 share of AMC. You control majority vote through either APE or AMC you control the company. Its literally the same stock, but a different ticker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z3h50dgf4ag91.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=06d5ee53885fe28a6b00ec2b1d4288965ac33820\n\nIn the relevant SEC filing on page 2 we find the following: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2cz2w0fj4ag91.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=a74fc0cded085ec7ac68a708ad3544b83e5e95a8\n\nFrom the same document we have black on white that they can dilute the APE token without seeking any shareholder approval\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jm8gbgbm4ag91.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=120d056291fab55c9b7bf9a9ac3142778d7398d2\n\n So both preferred stock units and common shares get the same voting power and can vote on the common stock amendment. AA can dilute the preferred stock by up to 4.5 billion shares. Assuming retail owns the entire float of AMC (this is not true) that means they will have to buy up after full dilution a minimum of 1.739 billion APE tokens from all dilutions to exclude any chance of being outvoted by any others on the conversion vote from $APE to $AMC common stock. Retail simply does not have that capital, and to be frank they do not own the float on AMC. Last shareholders meeting had a total of 268,775,910 voters as can be seen in the relevant SEC filing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l9gmhkep4ag91.png?width=729&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9fe7726220b88445c73ee355184390ccef64877\n\n What\u2019s even more funny is now during the weekend Adam Aron himself is admitting its a dilution on twitter and is floundering around trying to \u201ccalm\u201d his investors stating this is \\*\\*Good diluton\\*\\* and not bad dilution.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zbmk4svq4ag91.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=98d1faf1e1ae23de7eee4fc24ddfc414d1b32645\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqe4l8ds4ag91.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac810d60a466eab221e3c167e18c0bcb87002dc3\n\n \n\nFrom history AA is gonna dilute APE fast and dilute it hard to raise more capital to use on new acquisitions. Who knows, maybe he buys another unprofitable mine with shareholder raised money.",

But consider that there are more shares short than the company can offer, without severely diluting themselves, the management of the company, and their shareholders. \n\nI agree that GME should issues shares at a high price to fund current and future business operations, but that wouldn't do much against the short positions. If GME for some reason sold shares at a hefty premium, but well below its current price, it's leaving a lot of cash on the table and basically acting against its shareholders. \n\nWhether you like it or not, a publicly traded company has a responsibility (fiduciary duty) to its shareholders first. Diluting shareholders AND offering shares at price substantially lower than market value is asking for shareholder lawsuits. Guarantee you the board and executive team are not looking for that.",

Congratulations.\n\nI am not saying the populist anger isn\u2019t justified or that our system is not flawed or that these hedge funds didn\u2019t fuck up by shorting something with such a large short float. But sometimes it\u2019s good to stay calm and analyze things rationally and consider the following opinions from someone who was burned by the short selling ban in 2008 and lost my shirt with my puts in 2012 betting on a cascading bank failure in European when Draghi announced LTRO. There are a lot of things that can go wrong with the infinite money machine thesis.\n\nThe more the price of GME rises, the likelihood that the SEC will institute a short term trading ban on the stock increases. But vegaseller, you say, we will just Hold and when it resumes  our infinite money wormhole will work again, time is on our side, the shorts have massive margins interests which are compounding.\n\nThe problem will be when a private deal is negotiated between GME management and a short seller consortium. It is highly likely there are already negotiations underway between some individual short sellers and the company on a private deal to issue new shares at a significant premium, although much lower than the current market price. Management will be happy to double the shares outstanding at anywhere from $20-100 shares/share, a considerably discount to the current share price. Their concerns are retiring their existing debts and generating cash on their balance sheet for a pivot rather than maintaining their current shares price.\n\nAnd the higher the run-up in GME share price, the greater the incentive for short sellers to form a consortium and reach a private deals with management and the greater incentive for management to close a deal towards a higher price range. Once a deal is largely settled, they will loop the SEC in to institute a temporary trading halt on the stock. \n\nIf this happens, you guys would be left holding the bag and the share price could easily drop to $10-$50.\n\nThere is no shame in taking some money out. Just here to point out how the shorts can still get out at a much lower cost than you think. Again it\u2019s just food for thought, make your own judgement.",

Oh, and for the love of Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ, take your goddamn shill bots with you. Here\u2019s some gain porn and a rundown on my main lithium plays over the last month for those of you who remember what this sub is supposed to be about.\n\nMy options plays have been primarily focused on LTHM, L.A.C., ALB, PLL, and most recently SQM. As documented on my July 26th post \\[Link\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w820yu/hey\\_retard\\_take\\_that\\_fucking\\_crayon\\_out\\_of\\_your/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w820yu/hey_retard_take_that_fucking_crayon_out_of_your/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), I was holding ALB calls, LTHM calls, and L.A.C. calls at the time, along with a bunch of shares for those twice baked, long-term tendies. By closing bell on August 2nd, I was up about $12k, loving life and draggin my nuts around like I owned the place. Then, the ER for LTHM came along and gave me the ol' dick hammer and put my nuts in a vice. I lost all the options gains from the last week in minutes. Fuckin' options. But it was then, in my darkest hour of lamenting another retarded commodity play and nursing my pancake sack, that I remembered the words of my elders and bought that fuckin\u2019 dip with some more LTHM Sept expiration calls and held on for the ride. And up we rode.\n\nAugust 10-12 I did some profit taking and narrowed my positions to just some L.A.C. Nov calls and my shares of course. I got off a little too early, but better to be early than never as my Uncle Randy always told me. By August 16th I felt like things were running too hot, so I picked the lithium company I liked the least (PLL), and flipped the switch with some OTM Sept puts. Sure as shit, down she went. Sold those off piece by piece over the next few days for nice 2 - 3 baggers.\n\nMost recently, I played some SQM calls after they missed their EPS by less than 3% and tanked (almost like I learned from the LTHM ER... that's a first). Anyone with a brain that's 69% retarded or less would have seen that even though they missed, they were still up 800+ percent YOY on EPS, so this was just a great fuckin\u2019 buy opportunity. I bought Sept and Oct exp calls on the 18th after the ER crash\u2026 FUCK, too early. Kept crashing. But I was sure, so balls to the wall on the 19th baby; deep discounted OTM calls for Sept, Oct, and Dec. Leveraged up, used some of that cruel mistress margin. No sleep all weekend - feelings of excitement mixed with self-doubt - Sunday night anxiety on a whole other level. Then came Monday, then came Tuesday, then \\*I\\* came Wednesday. Made a month's salary in just my RH account alone in less than 3 days, so like an only half-idiot investor I took some profits and am now playin the rest on house money. \n\nHere are some green lines & numbers for you if you're not big on reading.\n\n[  $8,600 on July 25th](https://preview.redd.it/p4fkcxhf1rj91.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c5deffa587b98b723ecb7d4fefc7fbccd043ba1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[  $11,040 on July 25th](https://preview.redd.it/exw2whvk1rj91.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=8816070d038e205b7bcc5feed21c193c71fea8ca)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[  $37,800 on July 25th](https://preview.redd.it/2ahu8zbo1rj91.png?width=1073&format=png&auto=webp&s=f966979199f9157cd57ebf94705568d4dcdf4da9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those of you who made it this far: I think we are going to see ATH\u2019s on most lithium stocks in the coming days/weeks, so I\u2019m still in. Just google lithium spot prices and tell me that shit ain\u2019t gearing up for a moon shot. Current options holdings are fifteen L.A.C. 11/18 $30C, ten SQM 9/16 $110C, two SQM 10/21 $120C, three SQM 12/16 $110C. My positions on shares remains largely unchanged. I am holding 900 total shares of Lithium Americas (500 in IRA, 400 in brokerages), 50 shares of Albemarle, 275 shares of Livent, 250 shares of Sigma, and 50 shares of Sociedad Quimica. I did make a few minor acquisitions with 1000 shares of Arena Minerals, 900 shares of Magnis Energy, and 150 shares of Nano One Materials as well. Good luck, and god speed you autistic fucksticks.",

Luna being delisted from the coin exchanges is just the beginning. There were a lot of companies that got delisted in the 2008 crash, and many more throughout 2008-2012. That means that if you bought the dip, and the company gets delisted, the money you spent dollar cost averaging has vanished into thin air. Like a fart in the wind, POOF. Gone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat if I told you, that this crash is not a bail out, but a bail in. You see the dip buyers in 08, held on to their stocks and got rewarded by a bail out. What if I told you, that your dollar cost average dip buying strategy gets liquidated to save the company. THAT! Is a bail in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMorons will refuse to believe it can never happen. Albert Einstein once said, compound interest is the greatest mathematical discovery of all time. Lets play pretend. Lets pretend that there were 30 million young bucks who bought dip in lets say Apple, in 2008. Apple was like 30-50 cents in 08, can't remember. Now Apple has went from 50 cents to $150 in 12 years. Oh btw not only that, the dip buyers have now acquired 25% compound interest if they held. Now comes the bear market...If I was the owner of Apple or I was the main strategist, id let the stock go to $1, just like Luna. Now we file for bankruptcy and id tell Daddy Powell, \"No no don't bail us out, because if you bail us out we will still have these fat leeches with 25% compound interest\". \"Daddy Powell? Pretend like you're fighting inflation and can't bail us out, while we use this card over here. This card says Bail in. We will liquidate our own investors and start over\".",

The govt had too much control and fucked up all sorts of stuff. That is (mostly) settled.\n\nThe issue is real estate, and specifically leveraged government finance vehicles.\n\nBasically, the CCP told all the local govts to go fuck off if they wanted to get a big loan. Small ones only. But the various local authorities needed $$$ to develop themselves, and investors wanted some sort of foundation before investing.\n\nCue LGFVs and their promise foe delivering $$$ as they were \"private companies\" which could get loans not just from the CCP but from all over the place. Not just loans, but also attract investors not looking in local govt financing. Because, after all, this is just a \"private company\".\n\nSo local chinese communities now how private, decentralized, unrecorded loans. What could go wrong, right?\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nThe base drop came when the CCP *tried* to get an estimate on LGFVs and badically shit their pants realizing even their low estimates were metric fucktons that they knew the local govts couldnt handle. And by that point developing land had become a sort of default investment not just for international investors into china, but even local chinese investors.\n\nTheir entire local development was funded on mountains of unregulated debt and the CCP has been america-ing the debt and playing kick the can, but between the LGFVs and  actual private companies getting overwhelmed, the chinese housing and real estate market is one gigantic timebomb nobody wants to acknowledge, because doing so is akin to acknowledging how every mortgage rating agency leading up to 2008 was full of shit.",

Instead, they are full of new builds that were bought as investments. They're also a symptom of mismatched supply and demand.\n\"These homes being empty means they are sold out to investors and buyers, but not occupied by either the owners or renter,\" Xin Sun, a senior lecturer in Chinese and East Asian business at King's College London, told Insider.\nOn the supply side, Sun said, the government gets big sales revenue from leasing out land to developers. \"This gives the government very strong incentive to encourage development instead of limiting it,\" he said.\n\n\nChina can stop a transaction. The government can change the number of years you have to own a home. Or if prices are too low, the government won't give you a certificate of sale,\" Gan said. \"That is what's happening now.\"\n\"You won't see the price drop substantially, but you will see the transaction volume drop massively,\" he added. \"They'll stop the sale. By doing that, they can prevent the look of a massive price drop. They can prevent the crash.\"",

Heres why.\n\nChina imminent collapse.\n\nWar in Russia.  Nato escalations. \n\nWorld wide shortages. \n\n Cryptocurreny collapse.\n\nLet me start with \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 \n\nChinas economy has run rampant for the last 20 years.  The United States borrows trillions from China.  However, China is in a deeper bubble than we have ever seen.  \n\nChinas main source of economy is in real estate.   Do you know there are abaondoned sky scrapers in China right now?  Its like detroit had a baby with dubai.  They built a city for 10 million people and cant even get 100,000 to buy the properties. The banks print out real estate loans more than Jpow is printing out singles.\n\nThis happened in dubai as well, I'm not sure on current affairs but i remember all the sports cars like Ferrari and Mclarens left abandoned in parking lots and the desert after they defaulted and left country before they got their heads chopped off. (Serious arab law)\n\nToday you can explore abandoned high rises in china, some half constructed abandoned.\n\nIn 2021 Q4 484 chinese businesses defaulted on their major real estate payments. (This should be double digits)\n\nOn top of all of this, covid has run absolutely rampant to the point they are locking people in \ud83c\udf4e factories and can't leave.  This may be what pops the bubble but I would not put a nickel of my burger king check into any China owned companies. Have you all tried to buy a car lately?  You cant.  China and all of the nafta companies aren't producing near enough goods.  If you can't sell you cant make tendies.\n\nIf and when the bubble burst it will shake up an already rattled global economy with the \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 war.   I think this year possibly next the united states will enter into the war. \n\nAlready ships like the USS Kearsarge are in route to the Baltic Sea arrived 24hours ago\n\nI would guess a 5-10 trillion dollar loss on NASDAQ overnight is possible could be this year if announce of the war, I'm sure it will start with a russian attack that hits american troops, a plane or an embassy.  The moment this happens (it will) you need to start shorting before the boomers pull out of their 401k.  \n\nIf you already havent pulled out of your 401k consider it, transfer it to a roth ira or something like S&P500 on td ameriteade thats setup for retirement where you can pull out quickly. \n\nOn top of that the ticking time bomb of China we got a goold old great depression cooking.  \n\nAnyways boys\n\nPositions:\nLockheed\nRaytheon",

        "body": "First, I'm not talking about any squeeze potential, which can happen to either/both stocks. I'm interested in the business models of these companies.\n\n**Intro**\n\nI think many people are familiar with the RKT/UWMC feud after the RKT squeeze put both in the spot light. UWMC issued an ultimatum to mortgage brokers to stop working with other companies, which supposedly 90% of their existing broker partners agreed to. Many people here and on other subreddits are invested, and claiming each of these companies are significantly undervalued. I just want to put things into perspective from the business model side and future outlook side. \n\n**Business Model - direct lending and broker lending**\n\nFirst, let's talk about their business models. RKT is fairly diversified a number of lending businesses, with their TPO division for brokers but majority of their mortgage lending business direct to consumer. On the other hand, UWMC only deal with mortgage brokers, who make their cut between the lender and consumer. \n\nIn general, consumers with good credit and who has long standing existing banking relations with a bank or credit union will go there first. They may compare a few lenders to get the best rate, but generally working with lenders directly, especially if they know someone in the business. Only when you have a special circumstance on your credit history/rating or when you can't get a satisfactory loan directly from your local lenders, then your realtor may suggest going to a broker. Brokers make money because they may be able to get you a loan that otherwise you may not (or shouldn't) qualify for. This actually contributed a lot to the mortgage default crisis in 08. \n\nWhen I bought my first house I had a special circumstance for my loan application and couldn't get the loan size that I wanted with lenders, and my realtor suggested we can go find brokers who can find high interest rate loans of that size, some of them even from private lenders. Luckily we were able to find a credit union that could work with us. But you get the gist - mortgage brokers sometimes work with (and sometimes prey on) people with low credit who can't loans directly from lenders, and this is what they get paid for. Not all brokers are bad, but there is definitely a \"car salesman\" feeling from them. In the end, I would think the loans that brokers push through are in general more risky than direct to consumer loans. I don't work in the business but people who do could find some statistics. When rates starts to rise, and also after the mortgage moratorium end, the first to default will be these higher interest rate loans from brokers. I think RKT is positioned better than UWMC in a higher interest rate environment.\n\n**Innovation and growth**\n\nThis will go hand in hand with the valuation section below. Brokers, no matter what they are brokering, are a thing of the past. With information and technology, the trend is definitely for individuals to browse and pick on their own. This is not to say everything should be automated. Especially for a big purchase like a house, professional help is needed and this is why realtors still have a job even with the rise of Zillow and Redfin etc. But professional help is really only need for getting legal things done and for things that requires tacit skills like negotiating prices on an offer. Mortgage requirements are for the most part set in stone and rates are mostly non-negotiable. So what is the job of the broker? They just aggregate information for you, which technology is poised to do just as well, if not better. Technology also brings transparency so everyone's competing on a level field; you don't need to \"know a guy\" to get your loan at the best rates for your situation. This kind of no frills experience is the new way of doing business and led to the rise of Zillow, Carmax, lemonade, etc. RKT is trying to do that and this is what will transform the mortgage industry, not someone like UWMC, who is just trying to squeeze both the brokers and consumers to get more profits in the short term and stay alive.\n\n**valuation** \n\nA lot of people are talking of each companies valuations relative to many metrics like sales and earnings. You cannot compare these ratios to the tech and meme growth stocks that we are all so familiar with. Just go to finviz and put in P/S under 4 and see how many companies show up. If a company doesn't have high margins and/or potential for exponential growth, they will not and should not carry a huge P/S ratio. For UWMC, I don't see any way this company can grow very fast or innovate, especially given their hostile attitude towards their own broker partners. For RKT it's harder to say whether their technologies like the mostly automatic underwriting process, and also their attempt to have good UI and customer service, is enough to be deserving of a high valuation. But at least I do see them transforming the traditional mortgage business and I think they stand a high chance of maintaining their rapid growth as more tech-savvy people start to purchase homes.\n\n**Summary**\n\nDon't just buy into UWMC because they spiked later than RKT and they \"seem like an undervalued\" stock. A quick look at the different approaches of these two companies clearly reveals who is the innovative \"sleeping giant\" and who is the boomer stock. While both may be good speculative short term plays, if you are serious long term investor I would take a long and hard at these companies.\n\nNot financial advice, just my 2 cents on these two hot tickers. I'm holding RKT shares and leaps, invested before the spike, sold some profit and hold the rest for medium to long term.",

They essentially wrote them a blank check, while at the same time Congress was pushing low income housing legislation under the guise of \"Everyone should be able to buy a house\".\n\nThe issue was far more related to government taking on risk, pressuring banks to issue loans, and then acting all shocked that banks weren't more risk-adverse.\n\nThe lesson to be learned from 2008 was let banks fail, don't take on their debt, and don't try to push people into the housing market who couldn't afford homes because you find it sad they're not homeowners. Big business taking advantage of the situation is practically an afterthought in the whole scheme.",

A few of the things that stood out to me were A: how draining it all was for him, and B: How much of a mentor/dad he is to Stephen and John Oliver. \n\nAt one point he was asked if he felt like he was missing out having left the business right before Trump, and he compared it to having been a \"shit miner\" for years and years, and then finding out that a giant meteor made of shit was hurtling towards earth with the finest shit ore the world has ever seen. People would ask him, do you feel like you're missing out, and he'd reply \"I'm out of the shit business\". \n\nCan't say that I blame him. Part of what made his show so compelling was how invested he was in everything. At some point it felt like he was fighting against traditional news to bring some real change. I can't imagine how draining it must have been to watch those institutions slowly collapse anyway (despite his best efforts) then start pointing the finger at \"comedy news\" as the source of the problem. \n\nI get more reliable news from Late Night shows, podcasts, and reddit these days than I could get through most cable news outlets anyway, and he had a lot to do with that.

The entire first paragraph sets up their post by basically saying \"What I'm about to tell you is something that *surprised* a (totally real) friend of mine who is also a fellow psychologist.\"  That's called an **appeal to authority**, which he uses to preface his own amateur analysis of a comedian's tv show.  \n\nActual, educated professionals don't preface their posts with some unnecessary scenario about a conversation they had as a thinly veiled low-key way to tell us they're an expert in something.  It's wholly unnecessary and extra.  Have you ever noticed that actual professionals usually leave their sources and experience for the end of the comment?  Something like \"Source: 24 years experience as a clinical psychologist\". That's because after spending 8-12 years in higher education (you need a PhD to be a professional psychologist btw) writing countless papers- some peer reviewed- and a dissertation it's ingrained into their heads how to properly present an argument and cite sources, which are generally left for the end of a paper or footnoted.  Starting an analysis with an appeal to authority is something a well educated person doesn't do, at least not unless they're deliberately trying to deceive you.  He would have learned this as an undergrad.\n\n>  And it accomplishes this by maintaining a strict adherence to a roughly 20-second cycle in which a stimulus is presented, and a response is cued.\n\nlmao!  That's their big reveal!  Stimulus and response!  You know, that normal response mechanism we all learned about in high school, but the writer presents as some nefarious tool for brainwashing?  We're to believe that simple stimulus and response was enough to \"surprise\" their (again, totally real) psychologist colleague.   \n\n> in fact it is almost such a perfect technical accomplishment that I would almost have to admire it on technical grounds\n\nOh my gosh *the smug.*  No one talks like this.  Not even actual psychologists who might have a right to be smug while talking about their field.  He's trying way too hard to sound educated and he's out of his element.",

GME is the real deal; but check for yourself  using   \"float short\" under \"screener\" and \"custom\"\n\nSpread  the knowledge of how to do your own DD and identify squeeze opportunities.  \nIf the sub gets locked again you'll know what to do.\n\nDon't let them spread us too thinly.",

Finally after enough public shaming from Stewart, McConnell and the senate passed the bill like, only 4 years ago (keeping in mind 9/11 happened all the way back in year 2001). \n\nIn the time between the event and the passing the bill (approx. 15 years), many of those first responders died because they couldn't afford medical treatment. \n\nSo it is not surprising that Stewart is fired up about more political / government corruption like the GME situation.",

Everyone DOES win when the stock is fairly valued and shareholders\u2019 value grows as the company\u2019s does. But when the stock is in a market bubble with nothing pushing up the value but more people buying in, then it\u2019s bound to sell off at some point. People who bought in are bound to lose. Even without the brokers restricting trades, this sell off was bound to happen. This is basic finance 101. Most of you who bought in were bound to lose your money anyways, just like people who bought the dot com bubble at the top, just like people who bought the VW short squeeze, D***c***, etc. The brokers didn\u2019t want to restrict trades on these stocks - they were made to by their clearing houses because the clearing houses didn\u2019t want to be on the hook for when most of you tards became insolvent. They simply were not equipped for the market entering this level of volatility.\n\nOG WSB would never have garbage like this getting upvoted to the front page. Your money is your money.

But yeah, literally all of this was called in advance and then it literally happened, so I'm not too worried about it. 6,000,000+ new people in this sub that weren't here when it started to pick up and weren't able to soak up all the information prior to the mainstream explosion, therefore are less educated on the situation and are more prone to folding.",

They are short ladder attacking. Think of this as 2 dudes passing shares back and forth over and over for 1 dollar less each time. The latest trade gets updated and it looks like the price is falling, but it's really just two dudes being idiots. They are trying to create FAKE volume in order to scare people to sell, creating REAL volume.\n\nThe sad thing is, it probably worked a bit today. The other thing is, myself and many others BOUGHT MORE. Why? BECAUSE THEY ARE STILL WAY OVERSHORTED.\n\nAlso, don't discount the fact that the whole fucking world came together to save gamestop, and there is massive \"social citizen\" collatoral that Gamestop has gained in this massive event. That singlehandedly means that any smart CEO will capitalize on this and turn Gamestop into an e-sports giant.\n\nThere were memes about Ninja turtles growing up and taking care of their old pal Splinter, and those memes are real. The world has got gamestop and we will help it recover.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because it's VERY LIKELY that $100 share price is very very good entry point, not just to fight the over-shorted stock, but also simply as a long term hold.\n\nThese prices just make it easier to go long on GME, and that actually being a smart play.\n\nLet these greedy fucks bleed out, the lower this goes, the more I buy, and many others also. And there's only 65M shares. That's 1 share per 65 million people. I myself represent hundreds of those people. How many others also do?\n\nTLDR, the language in this subreddit is a meme and to an outsider makes us look stupid. But there are a lot of smart people here, who understand that today changed everything. And the thing that changed is that it is VERY EASY to hold $100 GME for FUCKING DECADES",

Why are you all acting like you're losing? Because you literally fell victim to your own pump and dump scheme. This is literally the only way I can think of that a basically fraudulent act can be both completely unwitting but also wildly unprofitable. \n\nThe answer is you're acting like you're losing because you are, and it's because some of you are profoundly stupid, some of you just got caught up, and some of you are nihilistic and/or predatory.\n\nEDIT: I should clarify something. I'm not saying this to gloat. I don't have a horse in this race. I stay away from the stock market. I don't like risk. But I see in the comments that some guy put his life savings in at $327. I have no idea how much money that is, maybe his savings were 10k, maybe 100k. He bought in at $327 and now it's at $90. This guy lost three fucking quarters of his life savings and there's no guarantee that he's going to get it back. That breaks my fucking heart. I live like a monk so that I could squirrel away 30k in case whatever. Buy a house, buy a car, have a kid, not eat goya beans every night for the rest of my life. Whatever. If a bunch of people on the internet goaded me into putting all of that into stocks for an irrelevant, brick and mortar retailer *as a fucking joke,* I would blow my head off. Fundamentally he (and others) have nobody to blame but themselves for getting on the carousel but you're all perpetrating a really sick and unfunny joke.",

Market markers and hedgefund friends are going to use stocks that they own and trade them very very quickly with each other at low low prices. The supply is still low, they are only trading a couple hundred or thousand stocks, but the system can\u2019t recognize that its the same stocks being traded. Its just seeing the amount of times the same stock is being traded. So one stock being moved 5 times the system, sees as 5 different stocks, and therefore think the supply is high. \n\nThing is, this only drives the price down. It doesn\u2019t matter though, since you as someone who is holding isn\u2019t selling at that price. It doesn\u2019t matter what the price is at if no one is selling. See, the price decrease because the same stocks are being traded constantly tricking the system into thinking its multiple stocks being traded once, however since the price is too low for the people who are holding the other stocks they are not selling. The supply is still low. \n\nWhy is this important? It is important because the hedge funds need to buy your stocks to close their positions. They literally cannot close their shorts unless they buy your stocks. This is why you are supposed to hold your stocks, no matter how low the price is. The price is a facade, they want you to sell at a price they are setting. If you are not selling even though the price is low, they cant buy. If they can\u2019t buy, they can\u2019t close their shorts. If they can\u2019t close their shorts, they\u2019ll have to pay interest. And if the interest becomes too much, they are going to be forced to buy your stocks at whatever price you offer. This is the squeeze. \n\nThe squeeze starts when the hedge fund can\u2019t afford to trick the system anymore since the interest on their shorts are getting too much. They\u2019ll have to pay whatever we ask of them. If no one sells until 1000usd, they are going to be forced to pay that. If no one sells until 10000usd, they\u2019ll have to pay that amount instead. When they are forced to close their positions, they will flood the marketplace with orders to buy. This is going to skyrocket the stocks, and the price will keep rising until people start selling. However, if you sell during the short ladder attacks, the squeeze wont happen. The price set during the attacks isn\u2019t the actual price. It\u2019s the price thats tricked into the system. \n\nThis is why you HOLD no matter how much the price goes down. If everyone holds, there is no supply and if there is no supply it doesn\u2019t matter how low the price is SINCE THERE IS LITERALLY NO ONE FOR THE HEDGE FUNDS TO BUY FROM so they can\u2019t close their positions, they\u2019ll have to keep paying for the interest and at some point, they WILL have to BUY YOUR STOCKS no matter the price.",

(They also have more than 300B in Debt)\n\nOvershadowed by the recent infinite money glitch known as $GME and $AMC, $DB experienced THREE gigantic scandals in one week.\n\n1.

Projected Price using Benjamin Graham Formula\n\n1a. SQR ((15)(1.5)(.1)(0.2939)) = 0.81 (actual value per share)\n\n2. P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)\n\n2a. ((16.70)(0.1)) = 1.67 (intrinsic value)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis means the actual *value* of the stock is *Drumroll Please...*\n\nBetween  $0.81 - $1.67\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf my math is correct (and it probably isn't), then this means that Deutsche Bank's stock is MASSIVELY overvalued and is due for a market correction (hence the AMAZING shorting opportunity). Also, if I am wrong please correct me - I only would like to learn more about the market, so I can eventually lose $5,000,000 in an earnings call.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent Price = 10.12\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not want to mess up the momentum of $GME or $AMC, I am only posting this because in the same way that we LIKE those stocks, I think we should also be open to DISLIKING some of the worst stocks on the market. Especially stocks with ties to CNBC and the other hedge fund assholes who have enslaved us with debt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Full Disclosure: I do not have access to margin with my brokerage therefore limiting my ability to make this trade. I also lack the capital to do so. This post is not intended to be financial advice, rather an analysis of current market conditions.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Sources:\n\n1.

The slv battle is mostly being fought by the gold bugs aka the boomers aka people with more money than us. They've been inspired by our movements, so they want to stand up and do something right. It's just that they don't believe in buying GME at $400 a share or whatever price it may be tomorrow. These boomers know and believe in Silver because they were around when fiat was backed by any physical asset such as gold and silver. It makes more sense for them to buy gold and silver for what they believe in. Not everyone is an autists who can throw money at GME even if it's at hundreds of dollars per share. Full disclosure. I'm an autist and I bought GME shares for the cause.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point is stop bashing these boomers for trying to do something they believe in. Let them do whatever the fuck they want with SLV. You don't have to buy if you don't agree. They support our cause and we should support their cause as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApes power!",

Marijuana ain't goin anywhere and neither am I. \ud83d\ude0e. \n\nWhat's up apes, autists, retards, degenerates, and every other person with fuckin \ud83d\udc8e\ud83c\udf46's. I first want to say my 5 shares of GME at $310 love every last one of you idiots, and *I'm NOT FUCKIN LEAVIN*. Our job isn't done, but at this point it's a waiting game for Melvin to realize this sub **will stay retarded longer than they stay solvent** We *like* this stock, and we *like* that game. In the words of the wise Papa Chamath \"I will win.\" \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\n\n**BUT WHAT ABOUT AFTER THE SQUEEZE IS SQUOZE?** What are you planning to do with your platter of tendies and squeeze cheese? Looking for ideas? Hear me out retards about a stock I like, and no I'm not gonna TLDR. I need the smart apes to hear me out. \n\n\n*I'm sorry SLVer surfers, but I am not one of you* ** *plus y'all are looking awful botty and shilly.* **\n\nCanopy Growth Corp $CGC. ~~We could force a national conversation about marijuana reform and free millions of people, from reddit.~~ On top of being a great company **that is already the official sports drink for TWO NBA teams** they represent a unique opportunity to make tendies, continue to make an impact on the world around us with our tendies, **and free fellow retards**. While we have all eyes on us, instead of taking on JP Morgan, let's help out the **millions** of future retards currently sitting in prison wishing they could join our moon missions. The current administration promised a lot prior to the election, and I think we need to help our fellow retards missing out on our revolution(s). APES TOGETHER STRONG. \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d \n\n~~\"BuT CaN We SqUeEzE tHem??\" **Yes, retards we fookin can.** To the tune of 1 billion dollars at the moment, and that's assuming those shorts didn't attend Melvin Short Academy and not learn how to close a position. They think stonks go down, but we know they only go down because of them. Stonks literally only go up.~~\n\n**No one wants to be seen as targeting shorts** and I want to make it clear, that is NOT the intention here. This is a company with wildly large\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 **catalysts**\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 coming very soon, and already starting to boil. **EVERYONE SHOULD DEMAND TO KNOW THE SHORT LOGIC** instead of defending long positions, especially with an amazing year ahead. Why would you short this stock? To me it's probably the same people who think weed turns you into a couch. You know the commercial. \n\nIf you're still reading, here comes the fookin \ud83d\ude80's:\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80[Majority Leader Chuck Schumer Spoke About Passing The MORE Act](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/chuck-schumer-says-marijuana-reform-bills-are-being-merged-as-congress-moves-to-legalize/) in an interview last week, and [tweeted about it afterwards](https://twitter.com/SenSchumer/status/1354601621670522882?s=20) . **This keg is ready to blow it just needs a little retard push** but it doesn't end there. There's more clear catalysts, and I again **do not understand the short thesis**\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n[Mexico is preparing to LEGALIZE marijuana THIS fucking April, 420 motherfuckers](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.borderreport.com/regions/mexico/mexico-puts-legalization-of-marijuana-on-hold/amp/) . Mexico would become the world's largest recreational marijuana market in the world, which ~~IS GOD DAMN MASSIVE~~ I guess you could call a catalyst for a recreational marijuana company, like $CGC. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80[They currently have a 15B market cap](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CGC/) in an industry that is expected to have [18% compound annual growth rate through 2025](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-cannabis-market-to-hit-47-billion-by-2025-301048501.html) .
