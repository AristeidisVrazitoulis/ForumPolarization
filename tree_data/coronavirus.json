One of the newest subvariants, called BA.2.75.2, can evade immune responses better than all earlier forms of Omicron.\n\n>For now, BA.2.75.2 is extremely rare, making up just .05 percent of the coronaviruses that have been sequenced worldwide in the past three months. But that was once true of other Omicron subvariants that later came to dominate the world. If BA.2.75.2 becomes widespread this winter, it may blunt the effectiveness of the newly authorized boosters from Moderna and Pfizer.\n\n>Every time SARS-CoV-2 replicates inside of a cell, it might mutate. On rare occasions, a mutation might help SARS-CoV-2 replicate faster. Or it might help the virus evade antibodies from previous bouts of Covid.\n\n>Such a beneficial mutation might become more common in a single country before fading away. Or it might take over the world.\n\n>At first, SARS-CoV-2 followed the slow and steady course that scientists had expected based on other coronaviruses. Its evolutionary tree gradually split into branches, each gaining a few mutations. Evolutionary biologists kept track of them with codes that were useful but obscure. No one else paid much attention to the codes, because they made little difference to how sick the viruses made people.\n\n>But then one lineage, initially known as B.1.1.7, defied expectations. When British scientists discovered it, in December 2020, they were surprised to find it bore a unique sequence of 23 mutations. Those mutations allowed it to spread much faster than other versions of the virus\n\n>Within a few months, several other worrying variants came to light around the world \u2014 each with its own combination of mutations, each with the potential to spread quickly and cause a surge of deaths. To make it easier to communicate about them, the W.H.O. came up with its Greek system. B.1.1.7 became Alpha.\n\n>Different variants experienced varying levels of success. Alpha came to dominate the world, whereas Beta took over only in South Africa and a few other countries before petering out.\n\n>What made the variants even more puzzling was that they arose independently. Beta did not descend from Alpha. Instead, it arose with its own set of new mutations from a different branch of the SARS-CoV-2 tree. The same held true for all the Greek-named variants, up to Omicron.\n\n>It\u2019s likely that most of these variants got their mutations by going into hiding. Instead of jumping from one host to another, they created chronic infections in people with weakened immune systems.\n\n>Unable to mount a strong attack, these victims harbored the virus for months, allowing it to accumulate mutations. When it eventually emerged from its host, the virus had a startling range of new abilities \u2014 finding new ways to invade cells, weaken the immune system and evade antibodies.\n\n>\u201dWhen it gets out, it\u2019s like an invasive species,\u201d said Ben Murrell, a computational biologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.\n\n>Omicron did particularly well in this genetic lottery, gaining more than 50 new mutations that helped it find new routes into cells and to infect people who had been vaccinated or previously infected. As it spread around the world and caused an unprecedented spike in cases, it drove most other variants to extinction.\n\n>\u201dThe genetic innovations seen in Omicron were far more profound, as if it was a new species rather than just a new strain,\u201d said Darren Martin, a virologist at the University of Cape Town.\n\n>But it soon became clear that the name \u201cOmicron\u201d hid a complex reality. After the original Omicron virus evolved in the fall of 2021, its descendants split into at least five branches, known as BA.1 through BA.5.\n\n>Over the next few months, the subvariants took turns rising to dominance. BA.1 went first, but it was soon outcompeted by BA.2. Each one was distinct enough from the others to evade some of the immunity of its predecessors. By this summer, BA.5 was on the rise.\n\n>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration responded by inviting vaccine makers to produce booster shots that included a BA.5 protein along with one from the original version of the virus. Those boosters are now rolling out to the public, at a time when BA.5 is causing 85 percent of all Covid cases in the United States.\n\n>But BA.5 could be fading in the rearview mirror by winter, scientists said. Omicron has continued to evolve \u2014 likely by sometimes jumping among hosts, and sometimes hiding for months in one of them.\n\n>Since these new lineages belong to Omicron, they haven\u2019t gotten a Greek letter of their own. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re just a slight twist on the original. Antibodies that could latch onto earlier forms of Omicron fare poorly against the newer ones.\n\n>\u201dThey could arguably have been given different Greek letters,\u201d Dr. Robertson said.\n\n>BA.2.75.2 is among the newest of Omicron\u2019s grandchildren, identified just last month. It\u2019s also the most evasive Omicron yet, according to Dr. Murrell. In lab experiments, he and his colleagues tested BA.2.75.2 against 13 monoclonal antibodies that are either in clinical use or in development. It evaded all but one of them, bebtelovimab, made by Eli Lilly.\n\n>They also tested the antibodies from recent blood donors in Sweden. BA.2.75.2 did substantially better at escaping those defenses than other Omicron subvariants did.\n\n>The researchers posted their study online on Friday. Researchers at Peking University reached similar conclusions in a study posted the same day.
