If you hit the jackpot prize, I kill you on the spot. If you don't win the jackpot, you get absolutely nothing, but can continue on your way. If the jackpot prize was only a 0.5% chance of being hit, would you be worried about accidentally being forced to play this game when you leave the house? If you knew I was wandering around and handing out these tickets, wouldn't you want to do whatever you can to avoid being given a ticket?\n\nI know it's cliche, but you can also think of vaccines like seat-belts in cars. They are a wonderful invention that provide protection for us, but they aren't a magical forcefield that prevents all bad outcomes. Sometimes a drunk driver hits us head on, or we lose traction and wrap the car around a tree. Seat-belt or not, you can still be gravely injured, or even killed. Does that mean it isn't worth bothering with a seat-belt?\n\nVaccines will help you at least some amount on an individual level, but they also help on a macro level too. The slower that covid spreads (vaccines help prevent some number of infections by requiring a higher viral load), the fewer people get those lottery tickets. It also means fewer mutations, which means more predictability and higher likelihood of better treatment options.\n\nSo yeah, it's worth it for everyone to get the vaccine, even the lower risk population.",

That totally makes sense! It totally didn't have anything to do with the fact that I have multiple autoimmune diseases or that the virus has had ample time to mutate into new strains. It also couldn't possibly have to do with the fact that so many people have rallied against vaccination and refused to get them / social distance / mask, which gave COVID even more opportunity to mutate into more contagious variants.\n\n\nYeah, I'm not blaming the vaccines for anything but keeping my infection more mild than it would of been.  Vaccines are one of the best tools we have to mitigate the damage and spread of COVID. They may not work 100%, but I'll take any boost I can get over none at all.

Bragging actually needs facts in order to be proper bragging!\n\nExamples: \nWhen your friends talk about how they couldn't get the sold our tickets to their favorite concert without buying it marked up, saying \"I got even better tickets than yours, and I paid wayyy less than what you paid.\"\n\nIn a thread about how difficult it is to pay off student debt, saying \"I didn't go to college and I make $200k per year. I don't have any student loans, so I can afford a 3k sqft house.\" \n\nIn a thread about smokers dying from lung cancer, saying \"I smoked 3 packs a day for 30 years, and I am still alive with no health issues whatsoever. I never tried quitting.\" \n\nAll of those separate statements can be true facts. But it's still bragging that you have or experienced something better than others, and it's pointless other than to make yourself feel good and others feel sad. Many of us had unvaccinated relatives who died from covid after and even before the vaccine even came out. So your saying what you did is bragging that you are better than they are. \n\nI hope you have the self-awareness to understand that there was a reason you posted what you did, and it's not just to \"share facts\".",

I was told not to bother repeat testing and I was supposed to have a procedure Sept 2, but because \"i have covid\" they won't do it or touch me for 4 weeks post positive PCR. Also they won't retest me on Sept 27 (during pre-admission testing). I've lost faith in the @ home tests. And I am beginning to doubt PCRs. Why not retest me in 4 weeks?? Weird. Is it because it's possibly faulty and i may be falsely positive.. i don't know, I don't think they really know unfortunately. It's just all contrary to what we've been told to do, or what to expect etc. Just infuriating.

That I was of excellent health and fitness so I just didn't worry about it. Of course I realized something could still happen but seemed like the odds were not high enough for me to worry about it. Ended up getting Covid twice and worst I suffered was two days of fever.\n\nIt has been a strange journey because when you follow the news you get the impression that you sometimes are observing life on different planets. It's just such big contrasts. In Sweden no lockdowns and very little masking. Was like a 6 month period were we had a bit of widespread mask usage but other than that very few masks in sight. Very I live you literally see no one using a mask for the last 5 months. See like a handful of them at the most per week.\n\nAt the same time we have people who have been isolating, hardly been out for over 2 years and completely overturned their life. And all the while I have just been living my life normally as have many other swedes. It's strange.\n\nI realize people here will think I'm an idiot but I don't care. Sure it could have been a bad choice to keep living my life during the pandemic. Maybe I lucked out? However in my circle of friends and family I don't know anyone who has suffered a lot from Covid ( of course they got sick but not badly so). A lot of those I surround myself with are fitness nuts though but have many that are not. Had one person tell me they had a decline for a couple of months in fitness performance after Covid but other than that nothing when it comes to long Covid. Pretty much everyone has had Covid and among my elderly relatives no one seems to have had lingering effects. No deaths and no hospitalizations.\n\nIt's strange. Different worlds like I wrote.\n\n(to long post but oh well, bored)",

Haven't been a problem.\n\nI guess the important thing in my opinion is that everyone is respected and no one is forced to do anything against their will. So if someone wants to go workout in the gym they should be able to for example. It's crazy to deny people taking care of their physical and mental health by shutting them out of gyms.\n\nAlso no one who like me isn't worried about Covid shouldn't be pressured and bullied to get vaccinated. Was a lot of blame and demonization cast on unvaccinated people earlier and that shouldn't have happened.\n\nSo if you guys want to keep masking and getting boosters I fully support it.

Those numbers are not in the range of very unlikely. And having had Covid X times without problems unfortunately doesn't tell you about the next one, just check the subreddits here with people fine after first infection and getting wrecked after 3rd or 4th.\n\nI don't want to sound mean with this post, I just hope it might save someone from this fate.

Obviously it's not going to be the same risk for everyone.\n\nI am unvaccinated ( don't care about downvotes so go ahead) and I have lived my life as normal during the pandemic. Reason I didn't get a vaccine was because I'm at a very high fitness level, basically highest amateur level in cycling. Sure I could still get very sick/die but the odds of that happening is very low. I can't compare my situation to someone who is overweight/elderly/have diabetes etc.\n\nHave had Covid twice and worst I suffered was two days of fever. In hindsight I am happy about my decision. It's not unreasonable to think that the vaccines would have caused me to feel ill a greater number of days than Covid has. Sure, like I wrote, something could have happened, but it's like that with so many things in life we do regularly without thinking twice about them. Many things have risks. I don't want to obsess about risks that are very unlikely.\n\nTo me it just didn't seem worth it to get a vaccine for something that most likely wouldn't affect me that much. I would have had to take time off training if I did get vaccinated. Can't do hard cardio training the days following a vaccination ( did 20 hours a week of cycling  for example this winter).\n\nSame thing with masking. Have only used one like less than say 10 or so times in total. Sure it might protect some but it's not worth it to me to have a mask on for 365 days a year just to avoid getting sick for a little bit. I rather get sick a couple of times a year than disrupt my life ( if we assume that masking would prevent it which is far from a guarantee). \n\n( also not an american, perhaps I would have felt forced to take the vaccines if I live in the US not sure)",

At this stage, I'm doing what I can to avoid contracting it, while making some exceptions to keep myself (and immediate family) happy and social (i.e. occasional patio meal or drive-in movie). What I'm HOPING for is to see some studies or data that can give me something more to go off of in terms of long covid. It seems like more and more data is being captured and sifted through now, so that's a good sign. But this whole '2-50% chance' of getting 'long covid' (which is loosely described as any covid symptom lingering longer than 12 weeks, it seems) and includes ALL symptoms from itchiness or malaise to degradation of brain matter or inflammation of your heart is just too up in the air for me.  \n  \nI would LOVE to know what MY risk is. Maybe it can't be exact, but even a super high level ballpark. Okay, white male, 35-45, no known health issues or medications, non-smoker, non/light-drinker. Is there a 1 in 10 chance of 'getting' long covid? Is that a 1 in 10 chance of ANY symptom (even occasional, mild fatigue?)? Is it a 1 in 10 chance of brain implications? 1 in 10,000 for cardiovascular issues? Where are we at in determining the impact of multiple reinfections? If I'm going to pull off the bandaid and 'reintegrate', is it okay if I get covid six times over the next year? Is that 6 times riskier than getting it once? Or 600 times, as reinfections are exponentially more harmful?  \n  \nSo I guess my answer is I'm waiting and seeing. Which, I know, is vague, I just don't know yet exactly what I'm hoping to see.  \n  \nI've told my wife I expect I'll have a good idea of where I'm at over the next couple of months. We've been virtually restrictionless all summer, but it really feels like we're starting a true test now. Offices are mandating people back in, more kids than ever throughout the pandemic are back in class without restrictions, and we're going to get some updated vaccines soon. My guess is, either not much has changed by Winter (in which case, I may open up to doing more) or, there is a *massive* uptick in infections, hospitalizations, work/school absences - in which case, I'll feel relieved for holding back, but depressed as fuck that this is still not improving as much as I'd like it to.  \n  \nAnywho, thanks for asking - hope you and yours keep healthy and happy, regardless of your approach!",

You have a better chance of stopping the virus invasion before it can get too deep into your body's borders.\n\nIf you haven't had a vaccination then it has to start doing that on its own from scratch with no military advisors or weapons stockpiles while the virus is actively taking ground in your body and is killing your cells by turning them into industries to support its invasion and expansion. Your immune system is stuck throwing the hand grenades it has used against previous colds at the virus' tanks while making a fighting retreat until one of its defense firms can produce a weapon that can punch through the tanks' armor. That can take a while, if it ever happens at all, and by then the virus might have captured enough of your body's centers of industries to make your entire internal nation collapse.\n\nIt's important to understand that this isn't perfect, just a big statistical advantage in your chances of success. If you run that war in millions of different timelines then there are going to be some where you're prepared and still lose due to any number of other factors not going in your favor, and there are going to be some where you're unprepared and still manage to luck into anything from finding the right counter weapons on the first try to encountering an undermanned virus invasion force. You're still way more likely to win in the former scenario than the latter, and if you're going to be forced to play the same gamble continuously then you play the odds if you want to win.",

I caught covid this year so I'm pretty sure it was a different strain than yours, and I lost my taste/smell for only a short while. But I remember being depressed because it was just... Missing. No clogged nose etc. All your descriptors are words I've used to describe that experience and when I asked some others I knew who had lost taste/smell they said similar things - muted, texture, sweetness, \"memory\" of taste. \n\nThe one thing that really stood out to me was a Mediterranean garlic sauce and pita bread that I had purchased from a local restaurant before getting sick. In a period where things tasted like \"nothing,\" it tasted like *something.* I was amazed. I don't normally count garlic as a \"spicy\" food either. My brother told me he tasted some whiskey, but he told me it was just \"spicy water\" to him. I could tell my tea was sweetened, which was interesting.\n\nI'm not sure if continuously assaulting your senses with garlic sauce is the way, but who knows. At least you'll taste something. Good luck and hope you recover sometime soon \ud83e\udd1e",

Every community that has had the tightest lockdowns has seen Covid ripping through the populace once restrictions are lifted. Even countries with cultures of masking have seen record breaking waves over the last year.\n\nLet me address this in more detail.\n\ntl;dr version: some countries used NPIs to control original covid; covid now is more infectious and their NPIs are no better, usually weaker, so of course covid is running loose.\n\nlong version:\n\nMasking isn't a binary thing, where you do it or don't do it.  It's a sliding scale -- multiple sliding scales, really: how good is your mask? your fit? Do you cover your nose?  How often do you wear it?  Do you take it off to eat out or attend parties?  And other NPIs are a scale too: how much do you social distance, what exceptions do you make?\n\nA nearly perfect culture of masking would be wearing N95s any time you're out of your household. No bars, no unmasked gyms or parties, restaurants surviving on take-out/delivery/outdoor dining.\n\n*No one* has done that.  In 2020 a bunch of places did the latter things, but people were wearing cloth masks.  Some countries required FFP2, but that was later after restaurants opened, also those are earloop masks so not the best.\n\nJapan masks *a lot more* than the US, certainly, but it's mostly surgical masks, and the restaurant/entertainment industries haven't collapsed, so it's not like they're avoiding high-risk situations.\n\nAlso, the same level of NPIs can stop, or not, different viruses: even the US's lame efforts killed off two flu seasons!  But not covid, because covid is harder.\n\nThe best countries *did* have different combinations of NPIs that controlled or even eliminated original covid.\n\nThen they got vaccines.  Many of them relaxed to varying degrees.\n\nThen Delta came.  It's *more infectious*, plus a bit of immune escape.  Without vaccines, you would need *stronger* NPIs to contain it, and everyone had *weaker* NPIs.  But they also had vaccines that mostly worked.  Japan and Korea still had relative Delta outbreaks -- vaccination and their original NPIs weren't enough to control Delta.  But it was close enough that some minor changes did control it.\n\nVaccination rates went up even more, and people relaxed more.\n\nThen omicron came.  It's at least as inherently infectious as Delta, *and* it laughs at prior immunity.  So you've got a handful of countries that were able to control original covid with some NPIs... but against a more infectious strain, and with NPIs that were no stronger and often weaker, yeah it runs completely loose.\n\nCould they control it again? Probably.  But apart from China, *no one* is trying.  *No other country* has gone \"hmm, this disease is more infectious, we should crank up our NPIs\".  Instead they're all resting on vaccination.  At most some countries are at least sticking to whatever NPIs they still had at the time (like Japan's masking culture), vs. the many countries that are totally giving up.  But since those NPIs + vaccination barely contained Delta, it's not surprise that NPIs + ineffective vaccination aren't containing omicron.\n\nWhat would it take to control omicron?  Well, in terms of immunity *vs. infection*, it's like we're back in early 2020.  So you'd have to back to what worked in 2020, and then some: not just mask mandates, but shutting down bars and indoor dining again, possibly even some lockdowns again.  Remote schooling again, or else school with strong masking and improved ventilation and stuff like outdoor or silent dining, and regular testing.\n\nShould we do all that?  I won't say that; the vaccines *do* still work to mostly keep people from dying.  But it's what would be needed to stop infections against omicron.  2020 immunity vs. infection, so 2020 measures.\n\nBeing 'careful' does work for sufficient values of careful: most of my friends still haven't had covid at all, and hospitals that keep using N95s masks and other precautions, still don't have covid patients infecting their staff.\n\nMaybe the new omicron vaccine will change what's needed, though I'm somewhat skeptical, partly because we're not giving enough of it: one smaller dose, vs. two larger ones like the original doses.",

I have more floaters, my vision is funky. Everything slightly shimmers. If I look at a nightlight in my peripheral vision, it flickers like a candle. I have tremors. My sleep was real bad. Still is but slightly better. Right side of my face feels weird. Have to put glaucoma drops in now cause high eye pressure. Side of cheek by nose twitches when one eye is closed. Severe anxiety and panic is an understatement. I checked myself into a pysch ward at the end of March. And after I came out I thought I was having partial aware seizures (auras) because I got these panic attacks, worse than before out of nowhere. The scariest feeling. Not like a typical anxiety attack. And I'm just brushed off. I know doctors hate when you say I researched something. I don't know more than doctors. They studied for years. But I am confident I'm more intelligent than some doctors. Got a 4.0 in my premeds. And not to sound conceited, but it was a cakewalk for me. I really should see a rheumatologist and get to the bottom of if I do have some type of autoimmune issue.",

Having mild seasonal allergy triggered asthma and OSA, having a common cold drop into my lungs isn't uncommon, so I weathered it at home, using my rescue inhaler and cpap to assist my breathing. My conversations with a friend in Europe turned to the novel virus found in Wuhan, and how people were using breathing exercises and herbs/vitamins to treat it. I added those to my regimen. But when my pulse/ox dropped to 94%, I suspected pneumonia and nearly called for an ambulance, sleeping in a chair, afraid to lie down. Then my fever broke, for the second time, I waited 24 hrs, then returned to work, wearing a mask, and dependent on my inhaler and menthol cough drops to control the lingering cough. 2 months later the first Covid19 case was detected nearby, and my friend started talking about neural effects, the smell/taste loss, I tested myself on a few strong ones, like citrus/mint/cinnamon and discovered that this was also a lingering symptom. I had severe back pain that I had attributed to returning to overworking, had an xray, and found lower lung damage/congestion. After a lung function test, my taste buds looked like bubble wrap, that turned to the grand canyon. My doctor started me on high dose Vit D. And I am now depending daily on my inhaler. \nI have cognitive issues with memory and vocabulary recall. A chronic convergence deficiency in my right eye that constantly weeps, and chronic nerve pain.\nI can't say it's long covid without a proper titer/genome sequencing, if that's even possible, but I went from being an active hiker/weightlifter, to having to stop halfway up a flight of stairs to catch my breath and rest my legs.\nMy doctor told me it is possible to have long coronavirus symptoms. I have had multiple PCR and antigen tests for CV19 over the past 2 1/2 years all come back negative. I returned to work fulltime a year ago, after the first vaccine, to a warehouse reporting multiple cv19 pos cases weekly, they were providing masks and had incentives for vaccination, but then dropped the mask mandate and have been removing plexiglass barriers and distance requirements since then. \nI know this is anecdotal, but atm I am fully vaxed/boosted twice and being 5 months out from my last shot, looking forward to getting the 5th, an omicron specific booster. With each shot I have seen improvement in my long haul symptoms that return in the form of a bad cold, sore throat, cough, fatigue, as the vaccine protection appears to subside. \nNew cases reported daily at my workplace. I continue to mask, distance and wash/sanitize. And people stare in disbelief.\nThere are links I could add, you'll find most of them on NIH speaking to long covid19, that describe my condition. My doctors continue to treat the symptoms, it's all I can afford. Dr. David Agus has been an invaluable source of information and reassurance. You can follow him on Community and text him directly like I do. His IG @davidbagus The number is in his Bio.\nPlease continue to protect yourselves at whatever level you can. Vet all sources of information and take care and be compassionate around people like me who are struggling. I appreciate it. My elderly Mom and 99 yr old grandfather appreciate it. I remain optimistic, looking forward to endemic CV19, and annual vaccine boosters and general health improvement worldwide. \nSorry for the long post. It's just the tip of the iceberg for myself and many others working alongside you, unable to afford self isolation, as government assistance was removed last year. Please be kind.\nEOM\n[Edited for multiple typos/grammatical errors].",

If you lose your sense of taste or smell, or worse, will they care? I bet they won't. If you end up with brain fog, and can't fully perform, will they be sympathetic and keep you on?

It was impractical to carry them all on you, all the time. At the same time, the people most likely to own stock certificates (merchants of some kind) could also be away from their homes when they find a buyer, and I don't mean \"just down the street\". Options contracts facilitated transactions by letting a buyer a seller agree on a nominal price for the certificates, to be delivered at some point in the future (usually within 1 year, often within months or weeks), but still give the buyer a to choose not to execute the contract if it was no longer a transaction they wished to make (hence the name: \"option\").\n\nBut stock traders being the degenerate gamblers they so often are began actually trading the stock options contracts themselves. You can get into the math on this, but basically, options contracts have an insane amount of leverage, and can exert a ton of pressure on stock prices - without any actual justification for those pressures. This causes price swings, which in turn encourages day trading and high frequency trading, and all of these drive the demand for continuous 'beat last quarter' performance. \n\nIf you were to eliminate, or at least strictly regulate, the trading of options contracts, you'd see a lot of volatility in the markets just evaporate. Then, the main reason people would be buying stocks would have more to do with the company, not whatever the various derivative markets around that company's stock look like.",

                        "body": "\"The world has been elated by the roll-out of multiple highly effective vaccines that prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Developing effective vaccines in under 12\u00a0months after the genome of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was made publicly available is a remarkable scientific tour de force. Over 3.1 billion vaccines against COVID-19 have been administered globally and over 67% of adult Americans have received at least one vaccination.\n\nThe origins of this historic accomplishment can be traced back directly to publicly funded innovations in basic science research and biotechnology. Because these critical contributions are often given inadequate attention in public discourse, we sought to review the origins of COVID-19 vaccines and the global implications of the risky, decade-long taxpayer investments that made this moment possible.\n\nKatalin Karik\u00f3, a Hungarian-born scientist, came to the United States in 1985. She reports being overlooked and scorned at the University of Pennsylvania1\u00a0as she was trying to develop messenger RNA (mRNA) technology to redeploy cellular mechanisms to create proteins that could be used for a variety of clinical purposes. She faced the challenges of working with synthetic RNA, which was easily destroyed before reaching its target cells and it frequently elicited an overwhelming immune response that could pose a danger to patients. In 2005, after a decade of trial and error, she and her colleague Drew Weissman published a seminal paper2\u00a0showing that modification of select nucleosides could suppress the body\u2019s recognition of synthetic RNA, avoiding a dangerous immune cascade. To accomplish this work, Karik\u00f3 and Weissman were supported by $2.3 million in grants for 6 projects from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\n\nThis finding caught the attention of Derrick Rossi, a stem cell biologist who initially thought it may be the key to growing stem cells. He shared it with his colleagues at Harvard and MIT, and they co-founded the biotech startup Moderna in 2010.1\u00a0Meanwhile, a husband-wife duo of Turkish-German physicians, Ugur Sahin and \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci, co-founded BioNTech in Germany in 2008.3\u00a0Sahin, an oncologist and inventor, co-founded Ganymed Pharmaceuticals to develop individualized cancer immunotherapies with \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci, a physician-immunologist. They sold Ganymed for $1.6 billion in 2016.3\u00a0In 2013, they hired Katalin Karik\u00f3 as senior vice president at BioNTech to oversee development of their mRNA technology with the goal of pandemic preparedness.1\n\nNearly every vaccine against COVID-19 currently being used to inoculate billions of people globally targets the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus\u2014a pre-fusion protein used by the virus to infect host cells. The structure of this protein was discovered by Barney Graham, the current deputy director of NIAID Vaccine Research Center, and his colleagues.4\u00a0He started this work by investigating a failed 1966 vaccine against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).5\u00a0He and his colleagues isolated the RSV fusion protein and discovered that pre-fusion antibodies were substantially more potent than the post-fusion antibodies used in the unsuccessful vaccine. In 2016, Graham and colleagues, including Jason McLellan, Kizzmekia Corbett, and Andrew Ward, published a description of the complete prefusion spike protein of a human betacoronavirus,4\u00a0HKUI1, which is related to viruses that cause SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and now to SARS-CoV-2. During this time, Graham received considerable government support for his research. He began in 1991 as a microbiologist and immunologist at Vanderbilt University. In 2000, he was recruited to the NIAID Vaccine Research Center. He and his colleagues received over $8.4 million in NIAID funding for 24 projects that contributed to their spike protein discovery.\n\nWhile the NIAID was funding these basic science innovations, the US Department of Defense was making high-risk investments in RNA vaccine technology through its Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In 2011, DARPA awarded CureVac (a Sanofi-affiliated company) and In-Cell-Art $33.1 million to advance their vaccine platforms and test candidate products.6\u00a0In 2017, CureVac researchers published the first phase I clinical trial demonstrating that an mRNA vaccine could induce functional antibodies against a viral antigen, the rabies virus.7\u00a0In 2013, DARPA awarded Moderna $25 million toward developing RNA vaccines against the viral diseases Zika and Chikungunya, validating the concept that mRNA sequences could be used to produce a secreted human protein and potentially scale antibody responses against a specific target in the human body.6\n\nThese foundational advances were funded in part by US taxpayers and laid the groundwork for the COVID-19 vaccines the world is racing to get into as many arms as possible. Without these investments, it would have been far more challenging to achieve the rapid and remarkable success we have seen with mRNA vaccine development during this pandemic.\n\nIn addition to US federal investment, there were substantial contributions by numerous other scientists, clinical trialists, research support staff, and tens of thousands of diverse volunteer clinical trial participants, all of whom were instrumental in advancing mRNA vaccines from their initial discovery to the inoculation of millions globally. Pfizer\u2019s often-repeated statement that it invested ~ $2 billion and did not receive any government research funding to develop its vaccine paints an incomplete picture, because its partner BioNTech received $445 million in funding from the German government to assist with COVID-19 vaccine development. BioNTech is now licensing the NIH\u2019s patented pre-fusion spike protein technology.\"\n\nhttps://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpt.2344",

That is *despite* the size of the study, and not because of it.  \n\nTo anyone familiar with precise writing, there's a very big difference between what they wrote: \"Finally, although this study was conducted in multiple sites and included more than 1,300 participants, findings from the study sample might not be generalizable to all populations\" and a hypothetical alternative sentence \"Finally, because the study only included 1,300 participants, findings from the study sample might not be generalizable to all populations.\"  There's a very key function that the word 'although' has there, and it contradicts what you wish that said.\n\nSo, again, none of the five points they list is because the \"size of the study\" was a limitation, let alone that there was a \"super small sample size\", they said that there may be groups that this isn't representative of *in spite of* the sample size being more than 1300 participants in multiple locations. And they're not even saying that they believe this to not be generalizable, but that they're allowing that may be the case.\n\nThe confidence intervals are what highlight that you don't understand what you're talking about. That you either do not have the ability to comprehend what the paper says or you refuse to acknowledge what it says. The impact of sample size is reflected in the confidence intervals. Small sample sizes do not artificially create statistically significant results when correctly handled, because they create very large confidence intervals. So a statistically significant result in a small sample size (where the confidence interval is large) is belying that it's far more likely to be a very significant effect in a targeted study, not that it's a non-effect. The result of a small sample size is that a real signal is far more likely to not rise to the level of statistical significance, not that a random deviation rises to the level of statistically significant.",

                        "body": "\"The world has been elated by the roll-out of multiple highly effective vaccines that prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Developing effective vaccines in under 12\u00a0months after the genome of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was made publicly available is a remarkable scientific tour de force. Over 3.1 billion vaccines against COVID-19 have been administered globally and over 67% of adult Americans have received at least one vaccination.\n\nThe origins of this historic accomplishment can be traced back directly to publicly funded innovations in basic science research and biotechnology. Because these critical contributions are often given inadequate attention in public discourse, we sought to review the origins of COVID-19 vaccines and the global implications of the risky, decade-long taxpayer investments that made this moment possible.\n\nKatalin Karik\u00f3, a Hungarian-born scientist, came to the United States in 1985. She reports being overlooked and scorned at the University of Pennsylvania1\u00a0as she was trying to develop messenger RNA (mRNA) technology to redeploy cellular mechanisms to create proteins that could be used for a variety of clinical purposes. She faced the challenges of working with synthetic RNA, which was easily destroyed before reaching its target cells and it frequently elicited an overwhelming immune response that could pose a danger to patients. In 2005, after a decade of trial and error, she and her colleague Drew Weissman published a seminal paper2\u00a0showing that modification of select nucleosides could suppress the body\u2019s recognition of synthetic RNA, avoiding a dangerous immune cascade. To accomplish this work, Karik\u00f3 and Weissman were supported by $2.3 million in grants for 6 projects from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\n\nThis finding caught the attention of Derrick Rossi, a stem cell biologist who initially thought it may be the key to growing stem cells. He shared it with his colleagues at Harvard and MIT, and they co-founded the biotech startup Moderna in 2010.1\u00a0Meanwhile, a husband-wife duo of Turkish-German physicians, Ugur Sahin and \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci, co-founded BioNTech in Germany in 2008.3\u00a0Sahin, an oncologist and inventor, co-founded Ganymed Pharmaceuticals to develop individualized cancer immunotherapies with \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci, a physician-immunologist. They sold Ganymed for $1.6 billion in 2016.3\u00a0In 2013, they hired Katalin Karik\u00f3 as senior vice president at BioNTech to oversee development of their mRNA technology with the goal of pandemic preparedness.1\n\nNearly every vaccine against COVID-19 currently being used to inoculate billions of people globally targets the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus\u2014a pre-fusion protein used by the virus to infect host cells. The structure of this protein was discovered by Barney Graham, the current deputy director of NIAID Vaccine Research Center, and his colleagues.4\u00a0He started this work by investigating a failed 1966 vaccine against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).5\u00a0He and his colleagues isolated the RSV fusion protein and discovered that pre-fusion antibodies were substantially more potent than the post-fusion antibodies used in the unsuccessful vaccine. In 2016, Graham and colleagues, including Jason McLellan, Kizzmekia Corbett, and Andrew Ward, published a description of the complete prefusion spike protein of a human betacoronavirus,4\u00a0HKUI1, which is related to viruses that cause SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and now to SARS-CoV-2. During this time, Graham received considerable government support for his research. He began in 1991 as a microbiologist and immunologist at Vanderbilt University. In 2000, he was recruited to the NIAID Vaccine Research Center. He and his colleagues received over $8.4 million in NIAID funding for 24 projects that contributed to their spike protein discovery.\n\nWhile the NIAID was funding these basic science innovations, the US Department of Defense was making high-risk investments in RNA vaccine technology through its Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In 2011, DARPA awarded CureVac (a Sanofi-affiliated company) and In-Cell-Art $33.1 million to advance their vaccine platforms and test candidate products.6\u00a0In 2017, CureVac researchers published the first phase I clinical trial demonstrating that an mRNA vaccine could induce functional antibodies against a viral antigen, the rabies virus.7\u00a0In 2013, DARPA awarded Moderna $25 million toward developing RNA vaccines against the viral diseases Zika and Chikungunya, validating the concept that mRNA sequences could be used to produce a secreted human protein and potentially scale antibody responses against a specific target in the human body.6\n\nThese foundational advances were funded in part by US taxpayers and laid the groundwork for the COVID-19 vaccines the world is racing to get into as many arms as possible. Without these investments, it would have been far more challenging to achieve the rapid and remarkable success we have seen with mRNA vaccine development during this pandemic.\n\nIn addition to US federal investment, there were substantial contributions by numerous other scientists, clinical trialists, research support staff, and tens of thousands of diverse volunteer clinical trial participants, all of whom were instrumental in advancing mRNA vaccines from their initial discovery to the inoculation of millions globally. Pfizer\u2019s often-repeated statement that it invested ~ $2 billion and did not receive any government research funding to develop its vaccine paints an incomplete picture, because its partner BioNTech received $445 million in funding from the German government to assist with COVID-19 vaccine development. BioNTech is now licensing the NIH\u2019s patented pre-fusion spike protein technology.\"\n\nhttps://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpt.2344",

Now that there's an updated vaccine, there's no indication of if or when it'll be available to kids. So parents of little kids will again be pushed along by the dismantling of whatever societal covid protections remain, while not being allowed the protections that everyone else has access to.

The tweaks to the new vaccine mirror the changes that occurred in BA.4 & BA.5 themselves. If those changes were to lead to ADE, we'd see that first in the millions of people who have experienced infection from one of those strains. Could some future variant figure out how to exploit the antibodies? Maybe?

But let me list the differences in situations.\n\nThe 30k was a double blind carefully controlled study. It was an efficacy study, which showed the vaccine to be extremely effective, and also insuring safety for side effects of incidence about 1/5000. \n\nGetting the vaccination is a benefit/risk choice. At the time, the Uk varisnt was around iirc, and the % chance of getting hospitalized if you got it was much higher. Therefore, you would have been ready to accept a slightly unsafer vaccine (although, after jabbing millions, it proved to be extremely safe, much more than the ~1/5000 that the trial could ensure, and then there was really no reason for anyone not to get it).\n\nNow, for this vaccine :\n-There has been no efficacy study. Previously, smaller studies about booster with omicron spike didn\"t show a dramatic increase in protection from infection. In any case, without efficacy study we simply do not know how well does this vaccine work. There are educated guesses with antibody measurements, but those do not always correlate with protection, the only way to know efficacy is to do the study.\n- Most people have either gotten covid, the jab or both. Couple that with the fact that omicron produces much milder symptoms and for people in good health, the chances of complications by covid have dropped significantly. For me, a healthy guy in his 20s who is vaccinated and gotten omicron, the chance of complication by a further infection are very low (looking at hospitalisation per million, its probably on the order of 1/10M in my case).\n-Compare the above odds with a vaccine that yes, had a safety study, but on 600 participants. While unlikely, if there was a serious side effect with 1/1000 incidence, it would not appear in such a study. However, it will definitely be noticed once a million people get the jab.\n\nI really don't think this is a hot take, it is pure probabilites and risk/benefit.
