In March, the group reported that the vaccine appeared to protect mice and monkeys that had been exposed to an array of coronaviruses.\"\n\nThe paper cited in this article: Mosaic RBD nanoparticles protect against challenge by diverse sarbecoviruses in animal models https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq0839",

Having mild seasonal allergy triggered asthma and OSA, having a common cold drop into my lungs isn't uncommon, so I weathered it at home, using my rescue inhaler and cpap to assist my breathing. My conversations with a friend in Europe turned to the novel virus found in Wuhan, and how people were using breathing exercises and herbs/vitamins to treat it. I added those to my regimen. But when my pulse/ox dropped to 94%, I suspected pneumonia and nearly called for an ambulance, sleeping in a chair, afraid to lie down. Then my fever broke, for the second time, I waited 24 hrs, then returned to work, wearing a mask, and dependent on my inhaler and menthol cough drops to control the lingering cough. 2 months later the first Covid19 case was detected nearby, and my friend started talking about neural effects, the smell/taste loss, I tested myself on a few strong ones, like citrus/mint/cinnamon and discovered that this was also a lingering symptom. I had severe back pain that I had attributed to returning to overworking, had an xray, and found lower lung damage/congestion. After a lung function test, my taste buds looked like bubble wrap, that turned to the grand canyon. My doctor started me on high dose Vit D. And I am now depending daily on my inhaler. \nI have cognitive issues with memory and vocabulary recall. A chronic convergence deficiency in my right eye that constantly weeps, and chronic nerve pain.\nI can't say it's long covid without a proper titer/genome sequencing, if that's even possible, but I went from being an active hiker/weightlifter, to having to stop halfway up a flight of stairs to catch my breath and rest my legs.\nMy doctor told me it is possible to have long coronavirus symptoms. I have had multiple PCR and antigen tests for CV19 over the past 2 1/2 years all come back negative. I returned to work fulltime a year ago, after the first vaccine, to a warehouse reporting multiple cv19 pos cases weekly, they were providing masks and had incentives for vaccination, but then dropped the mask mandate and have been removing plexiglass barriers and distance requirements since then. \nI know this is anecdotal, but atm I am fully vaxed/boosted twice and being 5 months out from my last shot, looking forward to getting the 5th, an omicron specific booster. With each shot I have seen improvement in my long haul symptoms that return in the form of a bad cold, sore throat, cough, fatigue, as the vaccine protection appears to subside. \nNew cases reported daily at my workplace. I continue to mask, distance and wash/sanitize. And people stare in disbelief.\nThere are links I could add, you'll find most of them on NIH speaking to long covid19, that describe my condition. My doctors continue to treat the symptoms, it's all I can afford. Dr. David Agus has been an invaluable source of information and reassurance. You can follow him on Community and text him directly like I do. His IG @davidbagus The number is in his Bio.\nPlease continue to protect yourselves at whatever level you can. Vet all sources of information and take care and be compassionate around people like me who are struggling. I appreciate it. My elderly Mom and 99 yr old grandfather appreciate it. I remain optimistic, looking forward to endemic CV19, and annual vaccine boosters and general health improvement worldwide. \nSorry for the long post. It's just the tip of the iceberg for myself and many others working alongside you, unable to afford self isolation, as government assistance was removed last year. Please be kind.\nEOM\n[Edited for multiple typos/grammatical errors].",

Although we used a valid forensic method to establish the biological age in the examined groups [20,31], adopting other methods which evaluate a large set of CpGs might be preferable [26,40]. However, the application of such procedures is undermined by the elevated cost and relative complexity and therefore may not be feasible at the laboratory level in many hospitals.",

Biontechs development really was german government money and then they licensed the production off to Pfizer in many world regions due to lacking production capabilities. What the us got from this deal mainly was a huge boost in production capabilties so that they could vaccinate first.\n\n(with an emergency order until april 2021 which did not let the production out, Canada in that timeframe was served by europe back then for instance)\n\nMost of the moderna research however was funded with US tax dollars.\n\nSo yes both are greedy fucks, pfizer biontech raking in billions on top of publicly subsidized research and moderna topping it with patent lawsuits!\n\nNone of them have invented this type of vaccination btw. this is way older!",

Taxes have paid the license fees, but if we are talking about origination / financing of the actual research, nearly all of that happened via European researchers supported (albeit not enthusastically) at American institutions. \n\n*Moderna tried to license the patents for modified mRNA that UPenn had filed in 2006 for Karik\u00f3\u2019s and Weissman\u2019s invention. But it was too late. After failing to come to a licensing agreement with RNARx, UPenn had opted for a quick payout. In February 2010, it granted exclusive patent rights to a small lab-reagents supplier in Madison. Now called Cellscript, the company paid $300,000 in the deal. It would go on to pull in hundreds of millions of dollars in sublicensing fees from Moderna and BioNTech, the originators of the first mRNA vaccines for COVID-19. Both products contain modified mRNA.*\n\nSource: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02483-w",

Moderna then created one for omicron and have been doing trials and testing for it  since it emerged and been updating it as omicron mutates. because only a small change to the RNA strand is needed they were able to keep updating it throughout the testing and trials without having to start over again, they will release within a few weeks a vaccine optimized  for BA5.   \n\nModerna can literally get the sequence for a new variant and have a vaccine developed and ready for production with 48hours. the problem is the regulations and testing needed. takes 8-10months minimum.",

It almost makes no sense.\n\nPfizer will make something like $30 billion per year off their vaccine, and when I say 'their' vaccine, I mean the one they got by making a deal with BioNTech for research they already took the initial risk on, and potentially violating Moderna's patent (the lawsuit will determine that). \n\nThe mRNA tech for Moderna and BioNTech came from UPenn's publicly funded research. But Pfizer had an ace in the hole - Trump's former head of the FDA Scott Gottlieb helped usher Pfizer's vaccine across the finish line by interfacing with the agency he ran just months before moving to Pfizer.\n\nIt almost makes no sense.\n\nSo I understand Pfizer wants to make $30 billion in order to fund all the projects that don't give a good ROI. They're not pricing the drug based on how much it cost to develop and manufacture - they're pricing whatever the market will bear. That's how you maximize profits and minimize losses, which is exactly the C Suite's job. Anything less is violating their fiduciary duty to their shareholders - that's how the system works. Shareholder value, executive compensation. That drives decision making.\n\nSo let's not pretend they're focused on innovation and ROI is somehow an afterthought.",

Money isn\u2019t even relevant enough to be an afterthought. Instead, tackling nasty disease and pathogens with novel approaches or technologies is constantly on the mind of every scientist I\u2019ve had the pleasure of interacting with. \n\nAt the corporate level, sure, they care about profits. However, from my experience at a top 5 biotech company in the US, the driving force is always innovation because ultimately that will bring profits. Therefore they invest in top quality scientists, and those scientists are overwhelmingly there because they want to help people. \n\nThe scientists that care about money end up leaving for venture capital firms or tech companies that pay 2-5x the salaries.

We all want something that will enable us to go back pre-pandemic, and surely this isn't it. \n\nIt's touted effectiveness has waned substantially between the first dose in 2020 and now because the virus has changed so much, some calling it essentially a new virus again so it's hard to imagine there can't be a better solution.",

Even in regard to the new Oct shot, which showed a benefit of increased antibody binding, it's not clear that this modest increase is meaningful in terms of outcomes.  To my knowledge there's been no large scale study comparing outcomes of the bi-valent vax vs ancestral virus vax, as this would be expensive and take a looong time. \n\nThe ancestral virus vax given in multiple doses is still surprisingly effective. The body naturally diversifies the b-cells ( b-cells produce antibodies) in response to repeated exposure to a given antigen, a process called \"affinity maturation\".  These b-cells variants are potentially targeted at viral variants, the greater the number of exposures to the antigen (i.e. multiple vaxes) the broader and more encompassing of variants, your response gets.  And in fact studies show the subjects with 4 vaxes produce greater binding to Omicron than those with 3, and 3 greater than 2.  \n\nSo the question becomes is it worthwhile to incur the expense and time to retool and produce a new vax formula?  Does +X more binding from a vax with an Omicron variant ( given that Omicron itself might become extinct not long after the new vax is released), really mean better outcomes?",

The only thing that matters here is what's actually in play, and that would be an outdated ~2.5 year old vaccine (I say this based on the discovery of the first covid-19 virus which is what this is based on) that's hardly helping anybody at this point and it sure is a funny coincidence that they've been dragging their asses when the funding ended.\n\nIf it was a purely virtuous endeavor, for one we wouldn't be seeing articles like this, and secondly, these companies wouldn't leave everybody this vulnerable by forcing us all to resort to using vaccines based on the first variant which is long extinct and essentially a different virus at this point. They've left those of us that care about being protected desperate and forced to use shit that isn't working effectively any longer. You don't even see this for flu, which uses an older technology to produce those vaccines. Miraculously they are ready every year.\n\nThey started from nothing, square one, some time in 2019 and had sequenced the virus (Yes a novel, or brand new virus) in December of that year, and then around a year later the first shots were given to the public on 14th of Dec 2020.\n\nFast forward to today 621 days later (Or 1 year, 8 months, 13 days) and currently we are still using the first, unmodified vaccine. What happened to their motivation? What is the excuse? What happened to all of these supposed advantages of MRNA? I thought they could sequence it and have something ready in such a short time period? Bureaucracy put a stop to that, but seriously? Longer than the time it took to create the first vaccine? I have to call bullshit.\n\nI can understand it taking this long to produce a vaccine the first go, but where is the progress? Considering the timeline alone, we have regressed as it has taken even longer than the first time to produce anything. To the point that it is a real risk that the virus is outpacing vaccine production and we fall into cycles of administering vaccines based on extinct variants.",

If that holds up, we'll see a 5 month decrease in time before shots in arm, and a much greater decrease for those under 18.

That isn't how any of this works at all.\n\nYou sound like you don't have any valid points to backup your argument.  \n\nWhy wouldn't solely greed driven companies release new variant specific vaccines regardless of effectiveness if they could?  Each new variant shot would be more income as people would want the new shots.  The only thing in the way of this is the testing and approval... which as pointed out, but you seem to want to ignore the logic of, requires the bulk of the time and excludes new vaccines that aren't adequately effective.\n\nIt's not like as if they didn't develop new variant vaccines.  They did.  They spent money on R&D for this.  They weren't effective in the tests and not submitted for approval.  As a result, they received no income from new rounds of variant specific vaccines.",

People that never had an interest on how drugs are made until covid think that it's always like covid. The vaccines and drugs that have come out during covid are the exception. Not the rule. The norm is that it takes years/decades to develop a new drug. It can take billions of investment by companies to do that.\n\n> They prioritize only profit, and that gives them a competitive advantage, so they win the capitalist dog fight 95 times out of 100.\n\nThey prioritize drugs that work. Since a drug that doesn't work is useless and thus can't make a profit. Less than that in fact, it turns into a money pit.\n\n> Whatever way you slice it, you've introduced a middle-man which will frequently go against what is best for society.\n\nWhatever way you slice it, companies produce more benefits for society now than anyone has ever done before.\n\n> Millions die of starvation while corporations throw away more than enough food to feed the world, because it's less profitable to feed the hungry than to dump tonnes of food waste.\n\nBillions are fed because companies produce food. If you want to blame someone for food dumping, don't blame the companies, blame the governments. Which insist that they dump that food or simply not plant it at all. They pay them not to plant.\n\n> My water and energy is held by a private profitable corporation. There is only one choice, I can't go and get water from anywhere else.\n\nYes you can. You are just demonstrating the it's not my fault, it's everyone else's fault mentality that is so endemic now. The lack of personal responsibility.\n\nThanks to for profit companies, there is no longer a monopoly on energy and water. You can make your own energy with solar panels. Remember when I said I've been on solar for decades. Now, you can make your own water too. Using solar power no less.\n\nI see the trend here. You think I'm defending the evil for profit companies. Yet I'm the one actually taking on my small personal role in making the world a better place. You rail against how bad the world is and yet you prop up everything you are condemning. How ironic.

They prioritize only profit, and that gives them a competitive advantage, so they win the capitalist dog fight 95 times out of 100.\n\nAnd what do you do when the private corporations use their immense wealth to lobby governments to prioritize roads, and neglect public transport?\n\nWhatever way you slice it, you've introduced a middle-man which will frequently go against what is best for society. The point of human endeavour should be to benefit humanity, not to make a privately-owned profit, and maybe help humanity along the way. And it very frequently doesn't work. Millions die of starvation while corporations throw away more than enough food to feed the world, because it's less profitable to feed the hungry than to dump tonnes of food waste. Millions die homeless on the streets while there are more empty homes than there are homeless people, because it's more profitable for private landlords to leave the homes empty. Companies get monopolies and you have no choice who to pay for. Companies lobby governments to sell off their public infrastructure and the natural resources of the earth. My water and energy is held by a private profitable corporation. There is only one choice, I can't go and get water from anywhere else. The literal natural water of the ground is held for random by private companies, until you hand over a profit to them.\n\nAnd let's not pretend that this is the natural order of the world. This is a specific set of economic conditions that have arisen in the recent few hundred years. Early man wasn't sitting there thinking \"well I don't want to discover fire or invent the wheel because there's no profit incentive!\".\n\nAnd let's not forget that most of the few good things that private companies do, they have to do, and fought against them at every step. If they had their way we'd still be on 7 day weeks, with children dying down the mines and in chimneys, with 0 days holiday a year, and next to no pay (or literal slavery). Every single one of these things was forced upon the capitalist companies against their efforts. What's the point of them? They're parasites that get in the way of human progress, let's bin them off",

From a mom and pop restaurant opening on the corner(small business loan/grant) to someone going to college(finance aid/pell grant) to semiconductor manufacturers(chip act).

Stop driving as much. Take the bus. I have. I stopped driving more than 2000 miles/year 20 years ago. Now I'm down to less than 1000 miles/year. I only use the car now when I have to move something bigger than I can fit in on bike/scooter. I started riding electric bikes/scooters 20 years ago before it was cool. Charged using solar, even 20 years ago. It's easy to blame the dealer, the oil companies, but it's really the junkie, the consumer, that perpetuates fossil fuels being dredged up. If there was no demand, there would be no need to dredge up supply.\n\n> Sometimes profit and benefit aligns, and that's nice\n\nIf you want profit and benefit to align. Then it's up to you and the rest of the consumer to demand that. People demand that others change when the change is up to them. Companies find profit where people are willing to spend their money. So if you want them to find profit where you find benefit, then show them that by voting with your dollars. Of course you are doing that right?",

Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna said it had patents from 2010 to 2016 on the mRNA technology that made its Spikevax shot possible but that the other two companies copied the technology without permission.\r  \n\r  \nModerna said it\u2019s filing suit in the US District Court in Massachusetts and a regional court in Germany. The complaints couldn\u2019t immediately be verified in court records.\r  \n\r  \nModerna said it\u2019s not asking the courts to pull the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine from the market nor to block future sales. The company is seeking damages for the period starting March 8 of this year and says it will not seek damages for Pfizer\u2019s sales to 92 lower- and middle-income countries.\n\nMore: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/moderna-says-its-suing-pfizer-biontech-over-covid-vaccines",

She's, if I'm correct, recognized as a pioneer in mRNA.\n\nAlso, Moderna's vaccine uses more conservative approach, described in literature.\n\nDifferences: \n- design of 5\u2032-UTR\n- design if codon optimization\n- design of 3\u2032-UTR\n\n\n- \"Moderna\u2019s mRNA-1273 has taken the fundamentalist strategy and replaced all GAA codons by GAG.\"\n\n- \"In contrast, Pfizer/BioNTech\u2019s BNT-162b2 took the liberal strategy, and left 14 GAA codons unchanged (Table 3).\"\n\n- \"Moderna has consistently applied the fundamentalist strategy for all codon families in mRNA-1273, whereas Pfizer/BioNTech has consistently used the liberal strategy in codon optimization for BNT-162b2.\"\n\n- \"The fundamentalist strategy will necessarily generate higher CAI or ITE\u00a0values than the liberal strategy. However, the liberal strategy might lead to more efficient translation elongation if there are too many codons demanding the most abundant tRNA, as I discussed before.\"\n\n- \"The design of the 5\u2032-UTR of BNT162b2 took the first approach by incorporating the 5\u2032-UTR of human \u03b1-globin (5\u2032-UTR is identical between human HBA1 and HBA2) with a minor modification of the Kozak consensus (Figure 2A).\"\n\n- \"Moderna\u2019s mRNA-1273 \u201cpasted\u201d the 110-nt 3\u2032-UTR of human \u03b1-globin gene (HBA1) between the last stop codon and a poly(A) tail.\"\n\n- \"The design of the 3\u2032-UTR of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine is a combination of SELEX and borrowing from nature. The objective is to find naturally occurring RNA segments that perform better than the 3\u2032-UTR of human \u03b2-globin mRNA [54].\"\n\n\nIf I'm correct, Moderna had help of US health institutions which have knowledge probably from university environment.\nKatalin Karik\u00f3 had been at US university so I think Amercian universities and agencies are the common ground if anyone had stolen anything.\n\nAfter all, I think it's a finite amount of approaches when one take into account time, technology, costs, etc.\n\nAlso, the proposed improvements for both vaccines and comparision had been part of the research study - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8310186/",

Now that there's an updated vaccine, there's no indication of if or when it'll be available to kids. So parents of little kids will again be pushed along by the dismantling of whatever societal covid protections remain, while not being allowed the protections that everyone else has access to. I get that a large percentage of parents choose not to vaccinate, but I want the option available to those of us who do want to.",

But let me list the differences in situations.\n\nThe 30k was a double blind carefully controlled study. It was an efficacy study, which showed the vaccine to be extremely effective, and also insuring safety for side effects of incidence about 1/5000. \n\nGetting the vaccination is a benefit/risk choice. At the time, the Uk varisnt was around iirc, and the % chance of getting hospitalized if you got it was much higher. Therefore, you would have been ready to accept a slightly unsafer vaccine (although, after jabbing millions, it proved to be extremely safe, much more than the ~1/5000 that the trial could ensure, and then there was really no reason for anyone not to get it).\n\nNow, for this vaccine :\n-There has been no efficacy study. Previously, smaller studies about booster with omicron spike didn\"t show a dramatic increase in protection from infection. In any case, without efficacy study we simply do not know how well does this vaccine work. There are educated guesses with antibody measurements, but those do not always correlate with protection, the only way to know efficacy is to do the study.\n- Most people have either gotten covid, the jab or both. Couple that with the fact that omicron produces much milder symptoms and for people in good health, the chances of complications by covid have dropped significantly. For me, a healthy guy in his 20s who is vaccinated and gotten omicron, the chance of complication by a further infection are very low (looking at hospitalisation per million, its probably on the order of 1/10M in my case).\n-Compare the above odds with a vaccine that yes, had a safety study, but on 600 participants. While unlikely, if there was a serious side effect with 1/1000 incidence, it would not appear in such a study. However, it will definitely be noticed once a million people get the jab.\n\nI really don't think this is a hot take, it is pure probabilites and risk/benefit. I lose almost nothing to wait a few months to ensure that the jabs safety and efficacy.\n\nOf course, for more vulnerable people, it is another story, and the balance of probabilities might change.",

As a medical provider, a common trope that we see is that people are often open to a change for a window and we can encourage them to make good long term choices in that window.  If you can place an alcoholic in a detox program directly from the ED,  they will go.  If they fit sent home and told that someone will call them in a few days, they go back to drinking and the window for positive change closes.  My experience is that often times unvaccinated patients are no different.  No every unvaccinated person is screaming about Tom hanks eating babies.  A lot of them just got bad information.  I get a lot of my patients vaccinated against tetanus, influenza, COVID by just having the vaccines on site and being able to discuss the risks and benefits at the bedside with them.  But a common point of pushback that we get from unvaccinated patients is that the current vaccines are years old and several mutational generations removed from the current circulating strains and not nearly as effective against the current strains as they were originally in late 2020.  And they are right.  Telling them that in order to qualify for a covid vaccine which is tailored to the current circulating strain that they must first get a 2020 covid vaccine, wait 3 to 4 weeks, then get a second 2020 covid vaccine, then wait again, then they qualify for an up to date seasonal covid vaccine is just going to result in a lot of my patients saying \"ah fuck it\" and continuing to be unvaccinated.  We should be making it as easy as possible to get vaccinated if we want to encourage more people to get vaccinated and minimize the circulation of covid.  Telling people \"you snooze, you lose\" just results in unvaccinated people continuing to be unvaccinated which helps no one.",

I\u2019m 34 and he is in his 40s. His kids had a higher reaction. Both stayed home from school the next day with chills, headache, and weird leg weakness. All symptoms went away in 24 hours for them. I spoke to them though and the leg weakness just might be a genetic thing because their youngest (14 & 18) told me he gets weakness in his legs when he is sick from colds and has had it happen since he was much younger. I had never personally heard of that or dealt with that symptom myself but it seemed normal for him so I shrugged it off. The father got the updated pfizer shot, his oldest got moderna, and youngest pfizer. \n\nAll four of us got our shots over a three day period and it did not seem like there was a huge amount of people getting it. When I went there were 5 people waiting to get theirs and about half the appointments taken for that day online.",

Most of us (myself included last month) came down with covid post vaccination anyways and it sucked, but more or less like an average flu.\n\nThe vaccines paired with the relative mildness of newer strains and the reopening of the world has made covid more of an afterthought in most people\u2019s minds. In my circles it seems that the only people still taking precautions are older relatives. If I were to walk into a store right now I\u2019d bet that only 10-20% of people there are still wearing masks. I think the average person is just willing to take the risk of getting it now.",

If you had a bad reaction to the shot *and* you still had a symptomatic COVID infection, it sounds like the infection would've been *far* worse if you hadn't gotten the shot first.\n\nThe extreme reactions to the shot are typically caused by your immune system's overzealous response. That is similar to the \"cytokine storm\" issue that was more commonly seen before the vaccines were available.\n\nIf your immune system was already primed in a way that has been clearly demonstrated to reduce frequency & severity of the illness and you *still* had a severe reaction to the third shot *and then* had a symptomatic COVID infection, then it sounds like you may very well have been hospitalized by COVID if you hadn't been relatively recently boosted.\n\nThis is the problem with any kind of preventative measure. Prevention has a cost, and *when it works best* the cost of that prevention is worse than the cost of the problem you're seeking to prevent.\n\nImagine doing maintenance on a bridge: you spend a ton of time and money, and *the greatest possible success* is that the bridge doesn't do anything differently - it just stays a bridge. That maintenance took a ton of effort, and it may well have kept the bridge from collapsing, but you don't get to see that. You just see a bridge, same today as it was yesterday. Even if you would've died due to the averted bridge collapse, the only feedback loop that exists for you is that the bridge maintenance cost a ton of money, taxes probably went up, and the bridge just... sits there...\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nPrevention works. Your immune system freaked out when it was primed with a safe dose of relatively inert proteins. What do you think it will do when it suddenly needs to respond as the virus spreads anywhere in your body it can find a foothold & your immunity from prior infection / vaccination has waned dramatically?",

My partner didn't even have a sore arm this time.\n\nLooks like our experience isn't just anecdotal, but is backed up by the data presented at the ACIP meeting, which also noted a large decrease in the number of side effects reported for the Omicron bivalent booster compared to the monovalent primary series and boosters (slide 9 of [this pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/06-COVID-Miller-508.pdf)).",

That totally makes sense! It totally didn't have anything to do with the fact that I have multiple autoimmune diseases or that the virus has had ample time to mutate into new strains. It also couldn't possibly have to do with the fact that so many people have rallied against vaccination and refused to get them / social distance / mask, which gave COVID even more opportunity to mutate into more contagious variants.\n\n\nYeah, I'm not blaming the vaccines for anything but keeping my infection more mild than it would of been.  Vaccines are one of the best tools we have to mitigate the damage and spread of COVID. They may not work 100%, but I'll take any boost I can get over none at all.  But hey, keep trying to undermine vaccines - it's really helping us win this battle against COVID, right?",

She fully knew how cautious we've been and why, and yet here we are. Fuck.\n\n\nI hope your recovery gets better soon. It's times like these that it's hard not to be frustrated / angry / etc. - but I am thankful that we made it far enough to survive thanks to the advances in treatment.

Bragging actually needs facts in order to be proper bragging!\n\nExamples: \nWhen your friends talk about how they couldn't get the sold our tickets to their favorite concert without buying it marked up, saying \"I got even better tickets than yours, and I paid wayyy less than what you paid.\"\n\nIn a thread about how difficult it is to pay off student debt, saying \"I didn't go to college and I make $200k per year. I don't have any student loans, so I can afford a 3k sqft house.\" \n\nIn a thread about smokers dying from lung cancer, saying \"I smoked 3 packs a day for 30 years, and I am still alive with no health issues whatsoever. I never tried quitting.\" \n\nAll of those separate statements can be true facts. But it's still bragging that you have or experienced something better than others, and it's pointless other than to make yourself feel good and others feel sad. Many of us had unvaccinated relatives who died from covid after and even before the vaccine even came out. So your saying what you did is bragging that you are better than they are. \n\nI hope you have the self-awareness to understand that there was a reason you posted what you did, and it's not just to \"share facts\".",

I tested at home again August 29 came out negative. Had a PCR test Aug 30 still positive. This past weekend I was at urgent care for lingering symptoms. I was told not to bother repeat testing and I was supposed to have a procedure Sept 2, but because \"i have covid\" they won't do it or touch me for 4 weeks post positive PCR. Also they won't retest me on Sept 27 (during pre-admission testing). I've lost faith in the @ home tests. And I am beginning to doubt PCRs. Why not retest me in 4 weeks?? Weird. Is it because it's possibly faulty and i may be falsely positive.. i don't know, I don't think they really know unfortunately. It's just all contrary to what we've been told to do, or what to expect etc. Just infuriating. I am definitely still having symptoms, congestion, headache, brain fog,  the worst is that I can't smell or taste anything at all!",

Ended up getting Covid twice and worst I suffered was two days of fever.\n\nIt has been a strange journey because when you follow the news you get the impression that you sometimes are observing life on different planets. It's just such big contrasts. In Sweden no lockdowns and very little masking. Was like a 6 month period were we had a bit of widespread mask usage but other than that very few masks in sight. Very I live you literally see no one using a mask for the last 5 months. See like a handful of them at the most per week.\n\nAt the same time we have people who have been isolating, hardly been out for over 2 years and completely overturned their life. And all the while I have just been living my life normally as have many other swedes. It's strange.\n\nI realize people here will think I'm an idiot but I don't care. Sure it could have been a bad choice to keep living my life during the pandemic. Maybe I lucked out? However in my circle of friends and family I don't know anyone who has suffered a lot from Covid ( of course they got sick but not badly so). A lot of those I surround myself with are fitness nuts though but have many that are not. Had one person tell me they had a decline for a couple of months in fitness performance after Covid but other than that nothing when it comes to long Covid. Pretty much everyone has had Covid and among my elderly relatives no one seems to have had lingering effects. No deaths and no hospitalizations.\n\nIt's strange.

I can\u2019t just stop seeing loved ones who have to take public transportation with a ton of unmasked people to get to their jobs.\n\nI don\u2019t have solutions to any of this, but I\u2019ve spent too many hours thinking about it, and I just can\u2019t stand the situation anymore. Suffering more permanent damage would eliminate the small bits of enjoyment I\u2019m able to get out of life in spite of my illness.\n\nI\u2019m just curious how other people with chronic illness are coping with this, and how they\u2019re navigating this scary reality. Because I wish there were some obvious way to properly handle this situation, but I can\u2019t see one.",

So the gym I work in has for example been open all through the pandemic and no masks in sight either in the gym. Haven't been a problem.\n\nI guess the important thing in my opinion is that everyone is respected and no one is forced to do anything against their will. So if someone wants to go workout in the gym they should be able to for example. It's crazy to deny people taking care of their physical and mental health by shutting them out of gyms.\n\nAlso no one who like me isn't worried about Covid shouldn't be pressured and bullied to get vaccinated. Was a lot of blame and demonization cast on unvaccinated people earlier and that shouldn't have happened.\n\nSo if you guys want to keep masking and getting boosters I fully support it. For me the pandemic is over, it never began in fact ( for me personally).",

Long Covid does not care about how fit or young you are, part of it is probably autoimmune related, that's why.\n\nSo in all honesty it's absolutely useless to make a personal assessment based on fitness or health. \nSpanish flu killed more young than old. \nYou would ask yourself again in your mind if you shouldn't have worn a mask even if you get the \"mild\" and prevalent (> 5%) Long Covid which leaves you still able to work. Those numbers are not in the range of very unlikely. And having had Covid X times without problems unfortunately doesn't tell you about the next one, just check the subreddits here with people fine after first infection and getting wrecked after 3rd or 4th.\n\nI don't want to sound mean with this post, I just hope it might save someone from this fate.

Obviously it's not going to be the same risk for everyone.\n\nI am unvaccinated ( don't care about downvotes so go ahead) and I have lived my life as normal during the pandemic. Reason I didn't get a vaccine was because I'm at a very high fitness level, basically highest amateur level in cycling. Sure I could still get very sick/die but the odds of that happening is very low. I can't compare my situation to someone who is overweight/elderly/have diabetes etc.\n\nHave had Covid twice and worst I suffered was two days of fever. In hindsight I am happy about my decision. It's not unreasonable to think that the vaccines would have caused me to feel ill a greater number of days than Covid has. Sure, like I wrote, something could have happened, but it's like that with so many things in life we do regularly without thinking twice about them. Many things have risks. I don't want to obsess about risks that are very unlikely.\n\nTo me it just didn't seem worth it to get a vaccine for something that most likely wouldn't affect me that much. I would have had to take time off training if I did get vaccinated. Can't do hard cardio training the days following a vaccination ( did 20 hours a week of cycling  for example this winter).\n\nSame thing with masking. Have only used one like less than say 10 or so times in total. Sure it might protect some but it's not worth it to me to have a mask on for 365 days a year just to avoid getting sick for a little bit. I rather get sick a couple of times a year than disrupt my life ( if we assume that masking would prevent it which is far from a guarantee). \n\n( also not an american, perhaps I would have felt forced to take the vaccines if I live in the US not sure)",

What I'm HOPING for is to see some studies or data that can give me something more to go off of in terms of long covid. It seems like more and more data is being captured and sifted through now, so that's a good sign. But this whole '2-50% chance' of getting 'long covid' (which is loosely described as any covid symptom lingering longer than 12 weeks, it seems) and includes ALL symptoms from itchiness or malaise to degradation of brain matter or inflammation of your heart is just too up in the air for me.  \n  \nI would LOVE to know what MY risk is. Maybe it can't be exact, but even a super high level ballpark. Okay, white male, 35-45, no known health issues or medications, non-smoker, non/light-drinker. Is there a 1 in 10 chance of 'getting' long covid? Is that a 1 in 10 chance of ANY symptom (even occasional, mild fatigue?)? Is it a 1 in 10 chance of brain implications? 1 in 10,000 for cardiovascular issues? Where are we at in determining the impact of multiple reinfections? If I'm going to pull off the bandaid and 'reintegrate', is it okay if I get covid six times over the next year? Is that 6 times riskier than getting it once? Or 600 times, as reinfections are exponentially more harmful?  \n  \nSo I guess my answer is I'm waiting and seeing. Which, I know, is vague, I just don't know yet exactly what I'm hoping to see.  \n  \nI've told my wife I expect I'll have a good idea of where I'm at over the next couple of months. We've been virtually restrictionless all summer, but it really feels like we're starting a true test now. Offices are mandating people back in, more kids than ever throughout the pandemic are back in class without restrictions, and we're going to get some updated vaccines soon. My guess is, either not much has changed by Winter (in which case, I may open up to doing more) or, there is a *massive* uptick in infections, hospitalizations, work/school absences - in which case, I'll feel relieved for holding back, but depressed as fuck that this is still not improving as much as I'd like it to.  \n  \nAnywho, thanks for asking - hope you and yours keep healthy and happy, regardless of your approach!",

That doesn\u2019t mean that every person who catches Covid is getting long Covid. The people who catch Covid and are fine, aren\u2019t out in the street screaming \u201clook, I was fine!\u201d Most just move on. It\u2019s easy to see the repeat reports and assume things are much worse than they are.\n\nThat said, I also agree that we haven\u2019t had as much reporting around long Covid outcomes for omicron specifically and including all vaccinations (and the vax, which I know is too knew to say anything for sure anyway). Does that mean people have just stopped caring? Or does it mean the evidence isn\u2019t there to support that folks getting Covid now are also getting long Covid?",

Now, maybe that's relevant and maybe it isn't, but vaccines vs. no vaccines, and Delta vs. Omicron seem like relevant differences between then and now.  \n  \nI've also seen *VERY* little with respect to what type of person is most likely to suffer from it. Are 90% of the sufferers eldery? Diabetic? Obese? Smokers? Etc. Personally, I'm fine with continuing to mask if I'm indoors, and I'm more than happy to continue working remotely, but I do feel like coming up on 3 years in, I have little to no idea of just how seriously I should be taking this. The overwhelming majority seem to be in the \"I'm vaxxed. That's enough.

You have a better chance of stopping the virus invasion before it can get too deep into your body's borders.\n\nIf you haven't had a vaccination then it has to start doing that on its own from scratch with no military advisors or weapons stockpiles while the virus is actively taking ground in your body and is killing your cells by turning them into industries to support its invasion and expansion. Your immune system is stuck throwing the hand grenades it has used against previous colds at the virus' tanks while making a fighting retreat until one of its defense firms can produce a weapon that can punch through the tanks' armor. That can take a while, if it ever happens at all, and by then the virus might have captured enough of your body's centers of industries to make your entire internal nation collapse.\n\nIt's important to understand that this isn't perfect, just a big statistical advantage in your chances of success. If you run that war in millions of different timelines then there are going to be some where you're prepared and still lose due to any number of other factors not going in your favor, and there are going to be some where you're unprepared and still manage to luck into anything from finding the right counter weapons on the first try to encountering an undermanned virus invasion force. You're still way more likely to win in the former scenario than the latter, and if you're going to be forced to play the same gamble continuously then you play the odds if you want to win.",

I caught covid this year so I'm pretty sure it was a different strain than yours, and I lost my taste/smell for only a short while. But I remember being depressed because it was just... Missing. No clogged nose etc. All your descriptors are words I've used to describe that experience and when I asked some others I knew who had lost taste/smell they said similar things - muted, texture, sweetness, \"memory\" of taste. \n\nThe one thing that really stood out to me was a Mediterranean garlic sauce and pita bread that I had purchased from a local restaurant before getting sick. In a period where things tasted like \"nothing,\" it tasted like *something.* I was amazed. I don't normally count garlic as a \"spicy\" food either. My brother told me he tasted some whiskey, but he told me it was just \"spicy water\" to him. I could tell my tea was sweetened, which was interesting.\n\nI'm not sure if continuously assaulting your senses with garlic sauce is the way, but who knows. At least you'll taste something. Good luck and hope you recover sometime soon \ud83e\udd1e",

Every community that has had the tightest lockdowns has seen Covid ripping through the populace once restrictions are lifted. Even countries with cultures of masking have seen record breaking waves over the last year.\n\nLet me address this in more detail.\n\ntl;dr version: some countries used NPIs to control original covid; covid now is more infectious and their NPIs are no better, usually weaker, so of course covid is running loose.\n\nlong version:\n\nMasking isn't a binary thing, where you do it or don't do it.  It's a sliding scale -- multiple sliding scales, really: how good is your mask? your fit? Do you cover your nose?  How often do you wear it?  Do you take it off to eat out or attend parties?  And other NPIs are a scale too: how much do you social distance, what exceptions do you make?\n\nA nearly perfect culture of masking would be wearing N95s any time you're out of your household. No bars, no unmasked gyms or parties, restaurants surviving on take-out/delivery/outdoor dining.\n\n*No one* has done that.  In 2020 a bunch of places did the latter things, but people were wearing cloth masks.  Some countries required FFP2, but that was later after restaurants opened, also those are earloop masks so not the best.\n\nJapan masks *a lot more* than the US, certainly, but it's mostly surgical masks, and the restaurant/entertainment industries haven't collapsed, so it's not like they're avoiding high-risk situations.\n\nAlso, the same level of NPIs can stop, or not, different viruses: even the US's lame efforts killed off two flu seasons!  But not covid, because covid is harder.\n\nThe best countries *did* have different combinations of NPIs that controlled or even eliminated original covid.\n\nThen they got vaccines.  Many of them relaxed to varying degrees.\n\nThen Delta came.  It's *more infectious*, plus a bit of immune escape.  Without vaccines, you would need *stronger* NPIs to contain it, and everyone had *weaker* NPIs.  But they also had vaccines that mostly worked.  Japan and Korea still had relative Delta outbreaks -- vaccination and their original NPIs weren't enough to control Delta.  But it was close enough that some minor changes did control it.\n\nVaccination rates went up even more, and people relaxed more.\n\nThen omicron came.  It's at least as inherently infectious as Delta, *and* it laughs at prior immunity.  So you've got a handful of countries that were able to control original covid with some NPIs... but against a more infectious strain, and with NPIs that were no stronger and often weaker, yeah it runs completely loose.\n\nCould they control it again? Probably.  But apart from China, *no one* is trying.  *No other country* has gone \"hmm, this disease is more infectious, we should crank up our NPIs\".  Instead they're all resting on vaccination.  At most some countries are at least sticking to whatever NPIs they still had at the time (like Japan's masking culture), vs. the many countries that are totally giving up.  But since those NPIs + vaccination barely contained Delta, it's not surprise that NPIs + ineffective vaccination aren't containing omicron.\n\nWhat would it take to control omicron?  Well, in terms of immunity *vs. infection*, it's like we're back in early 2020.  So you'd have to back to what worked in 2020, and then some: not just mask mandates, but shutting down bars and indoor dining again, possibly even some lockdowns again.  Remote schooling again, or else school with strong masking and improved ventilation and stuff like outdoor or silent dining, and regular testing.\n\nShould we do all that?  I won't say that; the vaccines *do* still work to mostly keep people from dying.  But it's what would be needed to stop infections against omicron.  2020 immunity vs. infection, so 2020 measures.\n\nBeing 'careful' does work for sufficient values of careful: most of my friends still haven't had covid at all, and hospitals that keep using N95s masks and other precautions, still don't have covid patients infecting their staff.\n\nMaybe the new omicron vaccine will change what's needed, though I'm somewhat skeptical, partly because we're not giving enough of it: one smaller dose, vs. two larger ones like the original doses.",

BA.1/2 infection confers 75-80% protection from BA.4/5 protection. So there\u2019s a balancing effect where people who were careful all along are now at highest risk (most BA.4/5 cases are first-timers).",

Severe anxiety and panic is an understatement. I checked myself into a pysch ward at the end of March. And after I came out I thought I was having partial aware seizures (auras) because I got these panic attacks, worse than before out of nowhere. The scariest feeling. Not like a typical anxiety attack. And I'm just brushed off. I know doctors hate when you say I researched something. I don't know more than doctors. They studied for years. But I am confident I'm more intelligent than some doctors. Got a 4.0 in my premeds. And not to sound conceited, but it was a cakewalk for me.

It's really hard to understate how hard it is to pass legislation with zero votes to spare.  Any objection by any senator could derail the whole bill and there really isn't a lot that leadership can do to persuade.  Democrats had to vote down several really good amendments to the act so that the tightrope they were walking to keep every vote stayed level.  Just one or two more senators would have meant a much bigger bill.\n\nI really appreciate how hard it is to feel connected to a group in Washington who seem to have a tough time delivering what you want to happen.  Aside from the obvious covid safety issues, for me climate change is that existential threat that we're not doing enough for, and it looked like we weren't going to make any progress under Biden for a while there.  But once you get more involved in a political party (or really any organization) it becomes more obvious why things are happening and what needs to change to make that happen.  And so I knew that we are really in an incredible situation here where Democrats have fought like hell for us, and are just now starting to get the recognition for it instead of the constant dooming, and where efforts from people like you and me really could be the tipping point to make a much better future.  Through things like canvassing, phone banking, text banking, or just donating, it can really turn the tide and give our representatives the tools they need to make a bigger difference.\n\nAnyway, I'll get off the horse here.  I'm really passionate about this because we're at such a crossroads in history.  But hopefully my rant above helps you to understand why I'm a firm believer in giving time and money to Democrats right now.",

I think it's $20-25 per dose with mass purchasing programs going on now.   Covering ordering, distribution, etc on top of doses and administering the vaccine will probably put it in that range.\n\nIf I recall correctly, $100-150 is about what insurance was billed for vaccines I've gotten in the recent past (Hep A, Tdap, etc).  Flu vaccine is $20-25 I think.  COVID vaccines that require special handling will increase the price (though I don't know how much they differ from other vaccines now that temperature requirements have been relaxed).\n\nAs far as I know, ACA compliant insurance is required to pay vaccines at 100% if they are given per the CDC recommended schedule.  I imagine that would apply to COVID vaccines as well.  We're just going from a somewhat streamlined purchasing program coming from tax dollars to a less streamlined insurance approach.  Which is highly likely to continue to drive premiums up, so we just pay for it less efficient and more expensive way.  And those that are uninsured are probably screwed unless there are government programs that continue to cover it for them.",

That being said, if I knew our vaccine program was only going to be funded through 3/4ths of 2022 I would have preferred that $35b to be put into the national vaccine program so that seniors like my aunt wouldn't have to incur any more medical expenses than she already has this year.

I'm not saying America is perfect or even agreeing with the decision being made in this article. It's just that it's being used as a buzzword which, in my opinion, de-legitimizes the experiences of those living in legitimately horrible countries that have no regards whatsoever for their people. When America was permanently funding vaccines that were going to waste we were in a corporate oligarchy because we were just wasting government money to boost company profits. Now we're not funding them permanently and we're in a corporate oligarchy because they're going under the blanket of normal insurance. Do you not see how you can't have it both ways?",

If you get it at all two weeks a year is pretty standard. After you work a place for a long time (my company six years) you get more...three weeks. We go up to a month after like fifteen years.

Eventually they figured it out and told me it was in the parking lot out back - apparently the assumption was still that you were still driving there, as the city only listed the address and name of the food pantry. Then I got vaccinated for free outdoors - no tent or anything, just a table and some chairs- and they gave me a certificate in case I needed proof.\n\n>I was super grateful, but I guarantee most people would not go through this much trouble if they are not high risk. And not everyone lives somewhere like this.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/totou7/the_us_powers_down_its_covid_defenses/i2hr2ib/\n\nSo relatively easy as these things go - I didn't have to sell a kidney, go without food, walk for eight hours, or anything like that, which is the kind of choice many people make every every day. Despite that, it can still be hard enough that many people won't manage to do it, so it was not 'very easy' in my mind.",

                                                            "body": "Funny issue here: if you have several policies to choose from, check the numbers closely. \n\nWe have several options & once I looked at the numbers in-depth I realized two of the options were shockingly similar in coverage, with an unexpected twist: the \"cheap\" one that is partnered with the HSA is pretty much objectively better coverage than the HMO option with the same company. Normally with an HMO you pay a higher premium but then you don't pay out of pocket, whereas \"cheap\" High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) that go along with HSAs have a cheap premium but you gotta pay out of pocket for basically everything until you hit your deductible. Once you hit your deductible (several thousand dollars) then your coverage ends up being basically the same as the HMO.\n\nThe unexpected twist: by opting for the HDHP and *planning on paying the entire deductible each year*, my family saves about the same amount of money *on premiums alone* as if we were to purchase the HMO that has a $0 deductible. So on the one hand you're paying a bajillion dollars in insurance premiums & on the other hand you're paying a bajillion dollars out of pocket until you hit your deductible. Since the coverage is basically the same after you've paid off the deductible, at that point it *seems* like it would be a wash, right? If you know you're gonna pay the full deductible anyway, why does it matter if you're paying it as a premium vs paying as a healthcare bill? An HSA lets you pay healthcare expenses with pre-tax dollars, but your insurance premiums are also deducted from your paycheck with pre-tax dollars, so there's no clear benefit there either way.\n\nThe big difference is a totally separate number on your plan: the annual Out of Pocket Maximum. On our plans, the Out of Pocket Maximums is *technically* the same for the HMO and the HDHP, but in reality they're quite different. How does that work? A stupid caveat for how health insurance billing works:\n\n**In calculating how much you've paid toward your Out of Pocket Maximum, they only include the amount you've paid toward treatment. Insurance premiums don't count.** \n\nSo if the HDHP has an Out of Pocket Maximum of $3k per year and a deductible of $2k, by the time you've paid off the deductible you've *also* paid 2/3 of the Out of Pocket Maximum. So since the coverage is basically identical once the HDHP deductible is paid & the HDHP deductible is less than the amount of money saved in premiums, you're basically choosing between an out of pocket maximum of $1k or $3k. If something major happens that requires a lot of uncovered healthcare spending, *you come out ahead* by purchasing the HDHP than by purchasing the HMO.\n\nThe only situation I can come up with that makes the HMO more cost effective is if you change your health insurance halfway through the year or something relatively unusual like that.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nWith my health insurance, paying for \"good coverage\" is just a pointlessly more expensive version of paying for \"cheap coverage that doesn't cover as much\", even when you need to use your insurance a lot. All the \"good coverage\" does is smooth your payments out over the year & ensures you pay the hospital more money.",

Private insurance companies are already dictating which doctors they will reimburse for at a reasonable rate vs the ones that you\u2019re more than welcome to see, for the tender price of your entire month\u2019s salary. They set an ever-evolving  Rx formulary that dictates the drug manufacturers they are willing to cover vs the ones you have to pay $100s or $1,000s for your monthly supply. They can and will reject a medically sound plan and force medical providers to make secondary accommodations which would be considered substandard to the proposed treatment. You might be forced to attempt numerous \u201cprequalifying\u201d methods of treatment before they will approve what a specialist MD is recommending as their frontline option. I was bedridden for much of the 6mo span that it took before a rheumatological hospitalist could provide the \u201curgent\u201d consultation request from my primary care provider. It turns out eczema will resemble a moderate-severe systemic autoimmune disease (ie, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, SLE) if not properly addressed by an underqualified family medicine practitioner. You might lose your capacity to use your hands and feet in the most basic capacities (holding/opening things, bearing your body weight in order to walk, etc), if the atopic dermatitis is left to its processes for some extended period, and you can expect to endure visible musculoskeletal deformation as you are waiting for that specialist assessment. All of the things that are claimed to be a hazard of socialized medicine are already happening. Except currently, we\u2019re paying significant sums out of our own pockets to get fucked over.",

So my advice is that if you don't have insurance, try and get it now while you still can. just remember a normal healthy person only needs two primary shots and 1 additional booster 4 months later to be fully immunized, and those who are moderately immunocompromised needs 1 additional, second booster 4 months after the first booster and that's it.",

It was impractical to carry them all on you, all the time. At the same time, the people most likely to own stock certificates (merchants of some kind) could also be away from their homes when they find a buyer, and I don't mean \"just down the street\". Options contracts facilitated transactions by letting a buyer a seller agree on a nominal price for the certificates, to be delivered at some point in the future (usually within 1 year, often within months or weeks), but still give the buyer a to choose not to execute the contract if it was no longer a transaction they wished to make (hence the name: \"option\").\n\nBut stock traders being the degenerate gamblers they so often are began actually trading the stock options contracts themselves. You can get into the math on this, but basically, options contracts have an insane amount of leverage, and can exert a ton of pressure on stock prices - without any actual justification for those pressures. This causes price swings, which in turn encourages day trading and high frequency trading, and all of these drive the demand for continuous 'beat last quarter' performance. \n\nIf you were to eliminate, or at least strictly regulate, the trading of options contracts, you'd see a lot of volatility in the markets just evaporate. Then, the main reason people would be buying stocks would have more to do with the company, not whatever the various derivative markets around that company's stock look like.",

This is often known as \"basic research\" (basic as in towards fundamental scientific understanding, not because it's simple or easy), and drug companies are famous for not funding it themselves. In fact, frequently, pharma companies won't bother producing medically useful drugs if they aren't *as* profitable as potential alternatives, e.g. RISUG/Vasagel, *tons* of [insulin formulations](https://hbr.org/2017/04/how-pharma-companies-game-the-system-to-keep-drugs-expensive), and numerous other examples where they see a new research discovery as a threat to one of their existing pipelines (which are slow/expensive to establish, but the free market is *supposed* to take care of that; the trouble is that US pharma is anything but a free market).",

                        "body": "\"The world has been elated by the roll-out of multiple highly effective vaccines that prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Developing effective vaccines in under 12\u00a0months after the genome of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was made publicly available is a remarkable scientific tour de force. Over 3.1 billion vaccines against COVID-19 have been administered globally and over 67% of adult Americans have received at least one vaccination.\n\nThe origins of this historic accomplishment can be traced back directly to publicly funded innovations in basic science research and biotechnology. Because these critical contributions are often given inadequate attention in public discourse, we sought to review the origins of COVID-19 vaccines and the global implications of the risky, decade-long taxpayer investments that made this moment possible.\n\nKatalin Karik\u00f3, a Hungarian-born scientist, came to the United States in 1985. She reports being overlooked and scorned at the University of Pennsylvania1\u00a0as she was trying to develop messenger RNA (mRNA) technology to redeploy cellular mechanisms to create proteins that could be used for a variety of clinical purposes. She faced the challenges of working with synthetic RNA, which was easily destroyed before reaching its target cells and it frequently elicited an overwhelming immune response that could pose a danger to patients. In 2005, after a decade of trial and error, she and her colleague Drew Weissman published a seminal paper2\u00a0showing that modification of select nucleosides could suppress the body\u2019s recognition of synthetic RNA, avoiding a dangerous immune cascade. To accomplish this work, Karik\u00f3 and Weissman were supported by $2.3 million in grants for 6 projects from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\n\nThis finding caught the attention of Derrick Rossi, a stem cell biologist who initially thought it may be the key to growing stem cells. He shared it with his colleagues at Harvard and MIT, and they co-founded the biotech startup Moderna in 2010.1\u00a0Meanwhile, a husband-wife duo of Turkish-German physicians, Ugur Sahin and \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci, co-founded BioNTech in Germany in 2008.3\u00a0Sahin, an oncologist and inventor, co-founded Ganymed Pharmaceuticals to develop individualized cancer immunotherapies with \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci, a physician-immunologist. They sold Ganymed for $1.6 billion in 2016.3\u00a0In 2013, they hired Katalin Karik\u00f3 as senior vice president at BioNTech to oversee development of their mRNA technology with the goal of pandemic preparedness.1\n\nNearly every vaccine against COVID-19 currently being used to inoculate billions of people globally targets the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus\u2014a pre-fusion protein used by the virus to infect host cells. The structure of this protein was discovered by Barney Graham, the current deputy director of NIAID Vaccine Research Center, and his colleagues.4\u00a0He started this work by investigating a failed 1966 vaccine against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).5\u00a0He and his colleagues isolated the RSV fusion protein and discovered that pre-fusion antibodies were substantially more potent than the post-fusion antibodies used in the unsuccessful vaccine. In 2016, Graham and colleagues, including Jason McLellan, Kizzmekia Corbett, and Andrew Ward, published a description of the complete prefusion spike protein of a human betacoronavirus,4\u00a0HKUI1, which is related to viruses that cause SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and now to SARS-CoV-2. During this time, Graham received considerable government support for his research. He began in 1991 as a microbiologist and immunologist at Vanderbilt University. In 2000, he was recruited to the NIAID Vaccine Research Center. He and his colleagues received over $8.4 million in NIAID funding for 24 projects that contributed to their spike protein discovery.\n\nWhile the NIAID was funding these basic science innovations, the US Department of Defense was making high-risk investments in RNA vaccine technology through its Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In 2011, DARPA awarded CureVac (a Sanofi-affiliated company) and In-Cell-Art $33.1 million to advance their vaccine platforms and test candidate products.6\u00a0In 2017, CureVac researchers published the first phase I clinical trial demonstrating that an mRNA vaccine could induce functional antibodies against a viral antigen, the rabies virus.7\u00a0In 2013, DARPA awarded Moderna $25 million toward developing RNA vaccines against the viral diseases Zika and Chikungunya, validating the concept that mRNA sequences could be used to produce a secreted human protein and potentially scale antibody responses against a specific target in the human body.6\n\nThese foundational advances were funded in part by US taxpayers and laid the groundwork for the COVID-19 vaccines the world is racing to get into as many arms as possible. Without these investments, it would have been far more challenging to achieve the rapid and remarkable success we have seen with mRNA vaccine development during this pandemic.\n\nIn addition to US federal investment, there were substantial contributions by numerous other scientists, clinical trialists, research support staff, and tens of thousands of diverse volunteer clinical trial participants, all of whom were instrumental in advancing mRNA vaccines from their initial discovery to the inoculation of millions globally. Pfizer\u2019s often-repeated statement that it invested ~ $2 billion and did not receive any government research funding to develop its vaccine paints an incomplete picture, because its partner BioNTech received $445 million in funding from the German government to assist with COVID-19 vaccine development. BioNTech is now licensing the NIH\u2019s patented pre-fusion spike protein technology.\"\n\nhttps://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpt.2344",

Specifically, they are noting that there may be some populations that these results couldn't be extended to because while the study was large enough to provide robust results, there may be groups that this isn't representative of. That is *despite* the size of the study, and not because of it.  \n\nTo anyone familiar with precise writing, there's a very big difference between what they wrote: \"Finally, although this study was conducted in multiple sites and included more than 1,300 participants, findings from the study sample might not be generalizable to all populations\" and a hypothetical alternative sentence \"Finally, because the study only included 1,300 participants, findings from the study sample might not be generalizable to all populations.\"  There's a very key function that the word 'although' has there, and it contradicts what you wish that said.\n\nSo, again, none of the five points they list is because the \"size of the study\" was a limitation, let alone that there was a \"super small sample size\", they said that there may be groups that this isn't representative of *in spite of* the sample size being more than 1300 participants in multiple locations. And they're not even saying that they believe this to not be generalizable, but that they're allowing that may be the case.\n\nThe confidence intervals are what highlight that you don't understand what you're talking about. That you either do not have the ability to comprehend what the paper says or you refuse to acknowledge what it says. The impact of sample size is reflected in the confidence intervals. Small sample sizes do not artificially create statistically significant results when correctly handled, because they create very large confidence intervals. So a statistically significant result in a small sample size (where the confidence interval is large) is belying that it's far more likely to be a very significant effect in a targeted study, not that it's a non-effect. The result of a small sample size is that a real signal is far more likely to not rise to the level of statistical significance, not that a random deviation rises to the level of statistically significant.",

                        "body": "\"The world has been elated by the roll-out of multiple highly effective vaccines that prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Developing effective vaccines in under 12\u00a0months after the genome of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was made publicly available is a remarkable scientific tour de force. Over 3.1 billion vaccines against COVID-19 have been administered globally and over 67% of adult Americans have received at least one vaccination.\n\nThe origins of this historic accomplishment can be traced back directly to publicly funded innovations in basic science research and biotechnology. Because these critical contributions are often given inadequate attention in public discourse, we sought to review the origins of COVID-19 vaccines and the global implications of the risky, decade-long taxpayer investments that made this moment possible.\n\nKatalin Karik\u00f3, a Hungarian-born scientist, came to the United States in 1985. She reports being overlooked and scorned at the University of Pennsylvania1\u00a0as she was trying to develop messenger RNA (mRNA) technology to redeploy cellular mechanisms to create proteins that could be used for a variety of clinical purposes. She faced the challenges of working with synthetic RNA, which was easily destroyed before reaching its target cells and it frequently elicited an overwhelming immune response that could pose a danger to patients. In 2005, after a decade of trial and error, she and her colleague Drew Weissman published a seminal paper2\u00a0showing that modification of select nucleosides could suppress the body\u2019s recognition of synthetic RNA, avoiding a dangerous immune cascade. To accomplish this work, Karik\u00f3 and Weissman were supported by $2.3 million in grants for 6 projects from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\n\nThis finding caught the attention of Derrick Rossi, a stem cell biologist who initially thought it may be the key to growing stem cells. He shared it with his colleagues at Harvard and MIT, and they co-founded the biotech startup Moderna in 2010.1\u00a0Meanwhile, a husband-wife duo of Turkish-German physicians, Ugur Sahin and \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci, co-founded BioNTech in Germany in 2008.3\u00a0Sahin, an oncologist and inventor, co-founded Ganymed Pharmaceuticals to develop individualized cancer immunotherapies with \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci, a physician-immunologist. They sold Ganymed for $1.6 billion in 2016.3\u00a0In 2013, they hired Katalin Karik\u00f3 as senior vice president at BioNTech to oversee development of their mRNA technology with the goal of pandemic preparedness.1\n\nNearly every vaccine against COVID-19 currently being used to inoculate billions of people globally targets the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus\u2014a pre-fusion protein used by the virus to infect host cells. The structure of this protein was discovered by Barney Graham, the current deputy director of NIAID Vaccine Research Center, and his colleagues.4\u00a0He started this work by investigating a failed 1966 vaccine against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).5\u00a0He and his colleagues isolated the RSV fusion protein and discovered that pre-fusion antibodies were substantially more potent than the post-fusion antibodies used in the unsuccessful vaccine. In 2016, Graham and colleagues, including Jason McLellan, Kizzmekia Corbett, and Andrew Ward, published a description of the complete prefusion spike protein of a human betacoronavirus,4\u00a0HKUI1, which is related to viruses that cause SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and now to SARS-CoV-2. During this time, Graham received considerable government support for his research. He began in 1991 as a microbiologist and immunologist at Vanderbilt University. In 2000, he was recruited to the NIAID Vaccine Research Center. He and his colleagues received over $8.4 million in NIAID funding for 24 projects that contributed to their spike protein discovery.\n\nWhile the NIAID was funding these basic science innovations, the US Department of Defense was making high-risk investments in RNA vaccine technology through its Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In 2011, DARPA awarded CureVac (a Sanofi-affiliated company) and In-Cell-Art $33.1 million to advance their vaccine platforms and test candidate products.6\u00a0In 2017, CureVac researchers published the first phase I clinical trial demonstrating that an mRNA vaccine could induce functional antibodies against a viral antigen, the rabies virus.7\u00a0In 2013, DARPA awarded Moderna $25 million toward developing RNA vaccines against the viral diseases Zika and Chikungunya, validating the concept that mRNA sequences could be used to produce a secreted human protein and potentially scale antibody responses against a specific target in the human body.6\n\nThese foundational advances were funded in part by US taxpayers and laid the groundwork for the COVID-19 vaccines the world is racing to get into as many arms as possible. Without these investments, it would have been far more challenging to achieve the rapid and remarkable success we have seen with mRNA vaccine development during this pandemic.\n\nIn addition to US federal investment, there were substantial contributions by numerous other scientists, clinical trialists, research support staff, and tens of thousands of diverse volunteer clinical trial participants, all of whom were instrumental in advancing mRNA vaccines from their initial discovery to the inoculation of millions globally. Pfizer\u2019s often-repeated statement that it invested ~ $2 billion and did not receive any government research funding to develop its vaccine paints an incomplete picture, because its partner BioNTech received $445 million in funding from the German government to assist with COVID-19 vaccine development. BioNTech is now licensing the NIH\u2019s patented pre-fusion spike protein technology.\"\n\nhttps://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpt.2344",
