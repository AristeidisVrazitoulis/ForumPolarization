Current knowledge and epidemiology show that the virus variants for SARS-CoV-2 cause increasingly mild symptoms for fundamentally healthy children and young people, and that immunity in the group is very high.\n- Overall, we see that the need for care as a result of covid-19 has been low among children and young people during the pandemic, and has also decreased since the omicron virus variant began to spread. At this stage of the pandemic, we do not see a continued need for vaccination in this group. Therefore, we are removing the recommendation on general vaccination against covid-19 for ages 12 to 17, says S\u00f6ren Andersson, head of unit at the Public Health Agency.\n\nThe decision means that from 1 November 2022 only children in special groups with increased sensitivity to covid-19 are recommended and thus offered vaccination against covid-19. It is about individuals within groups that are judged to be more sensitive to respiratory infections in general, or have a significantly reduced immune system. These groups are defined by the Swedish Pediatric Association.\nFor fundamentally healthy children and young people, SARS-CoV-2, according to the Public Health Agency and representatives from the pediatric profession and the Swedish Pediatric Association, can be considered a common respiratory virus in this phase of the pandemic.\n\nThe general recommendation on vaccination against covid-19 is only removed for fundamentally healthy children in the 12-17 year age group. For those who have turned 18, the recommendation for adults applies, that you should take three doses to have basic protection against covid-19.\nThe Public Health Authority's decision has been made after dialogue with representatives of relevant organisations, including the Swedish Association of Pediatricians and the National Program Area (NPO) for child and adolescent health. The state of knowledge and the epidemiology of covid-19 is continuously monitored. In the event of a possible change in the situation for children and young people in Sweden, the recommendations may change.\u201d\n\nGoogle translation of article.",

The reason is the very low risk of serious illness and death from covid-19 in children and young people. In the future, vaccination against covid-19 is recommended for children in special groups.  \nDuring the pandemic, few children and young people have become seriously ill from covid-19. Current knowledge and epidemiology show that the virus variants for SARS-CoV-2 cause increasingly mild symptoms for fundamentally healthy children and young people, and that immunity in the group is very high.  \n\\- Overall, we see that the need for care as a result of covid-19 has been low among children and young people during the pandemic, and has also decreased since the omicron virus variant began to spread. At this stage of the pandemic, we do not see a continued need for vaccination in this group. Therefore, we are removing the recommendation on general vaccination against covid-19 for ages 12 to 17, says S\u00f6ren Andersson, head of the unit at the Public Health Agency.\"",

The way it was organized was, if we do not take into certain exceptions like when returning from outside Sweden, that as soon as people could just go and test themselves. There were plenty of places and never had there been any decline in testing stations, quite the contrary. The longer the state had to organize testing stations, the more opportunities existed.   If people do not want to test themselves, which they were supposed to do as soon as they had any symptoms, then it can depend on mainly two reasons: 1: they didnt want to do it. 2:they didn\u2019t have any symptoms. \n\nSure, some might have skipped doing it because  they didn\u2019t want to. But the vast majority simply because they didn\u2019t have symptoms. So can we please stop spouting any other ideas. Nothing has changed, the data is there. Stop importing US politics and applying it to EU nations, which most of the time (not always) have a somewhat sane, none polarized political situation",

This is made harder if the data is eventually provided, but wasn\u2019t available at the time (e.g., situations where data may be collected but unpublished, due to policy or changes in reporting periods.)\n\nAsking someone to prove that the data doesn\u2019t exist is asking them to prove a negative. That is the problem that I see with what is being asked. I am not suggesting one way or another that anyone is right or wrong about the availability. \n\nIf there are reports where the publishing authority claims it is no longer publishing or collecting data that might be useful, but if no announcement is made and it just stops appearing (or appears after a lengthening of the release cycle), a page or dataset of historic data doesn\u2019t necessarily prove that newer data doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIf they aren\u2019t believed, which is perfectly fine, it is much simpler and definitive to dispute the claim by proving that the data does exist (proving a positive).",

Even Scandinavia. \n\nThis statistic is basically destroying any argument you have about how they tried to skewer the numbers. \n\nThey basically always tested just symptomatic people, it was free and anyone could take it at any time. So that if there were any doubts they would not go to work. They stopped widespread testing when the pandemic was \u201cover\u201d in February this year, as in almost no one was in the hospitals. \n\nBut before that there was never any restrictions on testing. \n\nWorth to note is that we have a vaccinations coverage of 85% of the populations which is one of the highest in the world. Comparable to US 79% (if my source is correct) \n\nOne giant cause of our high mortality rates, was because of our elderly care that has been privatized, lots of people working odd hours resulting in lots of people meeting every patient instead of just a select few. It was a disaster basically. \n\nThey were slow, and slacked on the contact testing. Slow to implement stuff, and lots of other issues. \n\nThere is definitely stuff they could have done different. I\u2019m not arguing against that. But that was not the question here was it. It was stated that they stopped testing and they only did so after years of Corona, when hospitalization rates were down. \n\nSo no, they have not skewered the numbers. They have openly said exactly how they did it. They provided over mortality rates and They never tried to hide anything. They only stopped testing in February this year. \n\nBut then again, polarized politics in the US man. Inflammatory stuff.",

Some say that truth is subjective - here's what the scientific consensus is in America:\n\n\"Children represent about 19% of all reported COVID-19 cases in the U.S. since the pandemic began.\n\nWhile children are as likely to get COVID-19 as adults, kids are less likely to become severely ill. Up to 50% of children and adolescents might have COVID-19 with no symptoms. However, some children with COVID-19 need to be hospitalized, treated in the intensive care unit or placed on a ventilator to help them breathe.\"\n\nThat's a quote from this Mayo clinic article, which contains other interesting information:\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-in-babies-and-children/art-20484405\n\nAs for the side effects of the vaccine in children, this article describes the results of a study in which a couple thousand kids participated. Side effects were mild, if there were any at all:\n\nhttps://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/11/pediatrician-weighs-in-on-covid-vaccines-for-kids-5-11/\n\nMy impression is that in Sweden, the decisions and pronouncements from the top are that kids aren't going to get vaccinated. Your (I think you're Swedish?) leadership definitely came to a different conclusion than ours. Here I have shared the science behind the recommendations over here. Were Sweden's recommendations guided by the same science? If so, why did they interpret the results differently? \n\nIs it possible that there were other factors that weighed heavily in the decision, such as the financial cost of vaccinating more people? Are there cultural reasons that Swedes are blase about an illness that can (but usually doesn't) lead to serious injury, long term effects, and death? I wonder if it's possible that somebody at the top has personal beliefs and leanings that are having a large influence.",

The improvements to your life and health will be all around immense.\n\nObesity rate in my country is 21% and in US it's 36%, but I think the 21% is mostly 40+ middle aged guys who drink beer and watch football every evening.\n\nAnd I have been to the US, and I agree it's much more difficult to stay healthy there with the food you have. When I ordered food the difference was stark in terms of portion size, the fat, oiliness etc.\n\nEdit: US obesity rate for children is 23.3%, which to me seems crazy. For my country it's 7.6%. Around 3x difference. I think that's much bigger issue than children not getting the vaccine.\n\nIn addition I wouldn't consider obese people in the definition of \"healthy\".

Sure you can vaccinate, and do that, but I'm just saying that at this point the risks are similar whether you vaccinate or not if you are a young, healthy, below 30 person.

I know it is the same in Denmark as well. I can understand not wanting to give out a second booster of the original vaccine, but can\u2019t quite understand why they would not even give the option to have the bivalent booster for those who would like to have it.

How many swedes took it?\n\n41,9% of those 65 or older. Among those younger than 65 the number was only 2% of people.\n\n[https://www.lakemedelsvarlden.se/influensavaccineringen-slar-rekord/](https://www.lakemedelsvarlden.se/influensavaccineringen-slar-rekord/)\n\nBasically the guidelines here is that you don't need the flu vaccine if you are younger than 65 unless you have some underlying condition. Above that age it's recommended. Hence the 2% figure.\n\nIn general I think Swedish doctors are more hesitant here to prescribe medicine than in most other countries. Especially true when it comes to antibiotics.\n\nWe also have pretty stringent rules against advertisement when it comes to to medicine.\n\nAll in all it's very different that's for sure.",

This virus spike protein hooks onto the human cell via a \u201creceptor\u201d to gain entry into the cells: this is how infection starts. The virus then starts multiplying inside cells. It ultimately gets released by the cells and can go on to infect more cells.\n\n>The changes in the spike protein of 501Y.V2 are likely to enhance its binding with human cell receptors, allowing easier infection and greater replication within the host. This may result in greater amounts of virus in an infected person, who can then infect other people more easily. The ultimate result could be quicker spread among people.\n\n>Scientists have observed that 501Y.V2 has quickly become \u201cdominant\u201d among multiple variants that have been circulating in the South African population. This strongly suggests the new mutations of this variant offer a transmission advantage. In some regions of South Africa, more than 80% of viruses currently isolated from infected people are now 501Y.V2.\n\n>This is likely to mean that most people who are now infected have a coronavirus that is more easily transmissible.\n\n.....",

The \"public domain\" study I believe he's citing (which showed a greater than 40 percent reduction in neutralization activity for the South African variant) concerned convalescent sera samples in a lab setting - the study had nothing to do with vaccines.\n\nRight around the same time (AKA, a few days ago), an additional preprint was released that tested vaccinated sera against the most concerning mutations in the new variants (i.e. E484K) and found a \"small but significant\" decrease in neutralization. Not the full story just yet, but a good omen that we're not looking at an escape scenario - and probably nowhere near a 50% decrease in efficacy. \n\nVaccinated sera confers robust immunity - far more than just monoclonal antibodies. For one, neutralizing titers are typically much higher, creating a cushion effect for diminished efficacy. And in a clinical (non lab) setting, other elements of immunity (t-cells, etc.) will play a role as well (one that is significant but not fully understood). Even if infection is still possible in some vaccinated subjects, it could be the case that illness isn't serious, with the immune system correcting its antibody response to match new variants quicker than if it was beginning from scratch.\n\nFurther data will confirm, but I really do feel Hancock simply misspoke. There's no private data he's referencing for those worried - he even says the information is \"public domain\" and unverified (re: pre-print), which is why he \u201cwouldn't make such a statement publicly\u201d.\n\nAs for the studies I'm referring to - they\u2019ve been posted numerous times here and on the /r/covid19 sister subreddit. I'd cite them but I don't have time to look at the moment. If someone has them on hand, it might be worth linking to them.",

Then I started to feel sick a few days later around 10/5. I decided to at home test on 10/7 and it was positive so we went to CVS drive through and did PCR and we found out on 10/8 that we were both positive. His symptoms were much worse than mine at first. To clarify, we both received the original Pfizer vaccines plus one Pfizer booster. I received bivalent and he didn't. Neither of us had ever had Covid before (that we know of.) I can't help but wonder if he had received his bivalent shot when I did if we'd even be sick right now... Hard to say. The fact that I lived with him while he was sick for the first few days but felt 100% fine myself makes me think it was my bivalent trying to protect me but eventually I just got too much viral load either from him or someone else. I'm just relieved that I didn't even get a fever or any other symptoms except for mild cough and fatigue. I'm still not fully recovered though but I feel good enough to go for a walk every morning.

I felt ill for several days before I finally tested positive.

First symptom I noticed was intense lower back pain, followed by a loss of taste and smell.

I was having a difficult time catching my breath and started to consider seeking medical help.  Luckily it didn't come to that point - my fever finally broke and the symptoms started to slowly subside.  \n\nI still feel majorly fatigued and I'm dealing with a lot of chest congestion that I get into coughing fits trying to clear, but I am feeling considerably better than I was just 4 or 5 days ago. \n\nMoral of the story - don't put off getting the new booster shot.",

Kind of disappointed honestly because I thought the booster would work a little better. And to clarify, I have a 100% WFH job. Whenever I get groceries, I'm always wearing an N95. I don't eat indoors at restaurants (I always sit at the patio) and I'm very careful in general. However, the ONLY place I don't wear one is at the gym.

(Received original two shots, booster, then bivalent, and still contracted Covid recently?) \n\nBtw I don't even have a fever. The only symptoms I experienced were mild headaches, very mild cough and a bit of fatigue. I've still been taking several mile walks outside around the block/on a trail (wearing a mask just to be safe but no people around me at all really.) I honestly feel pretty normal. I attribute this to being vaccinated a bunch of times, taking precautions, and overall being a fairly fit and healthy individual. Or maybe I just got a lower viral load. Who knows!",

On an individual level masking will always be effective, but on a population level it's a mitigation tool and isn't going to be permanent.",

Around 8% told someone they were vaccinated when they were not. Nearly 23% reported having broken quarantine rules; 15% said they had told another individual that they did not need to quarantine even though they were supposed to, according to public health guidelines.\n\nI think one of the issues was having extremely confusing and misleading guidelines, at least in the USA. I'd be curious to see this compared to other countries. \n\nFor instance, in the USA they don't tell you the chance of a false negative on a test, so many symptomatic people took a COVID test and it was negative so they just assumed allergies and didn't disclose symptoms. In addition, during Delta I think many vaccinated people incorrectly assumed they couldn't transmit COVID, so they didn't get tested, etc. And obviously those 8% decided that they could lie about their vaccine status for whatever justification they found.\n\nIn short, everyone thinks their excuse makes sense to themselves.",

For example, I work in an industry where it seems like every company uses their own lingo for the same set of concepts.  So whenever I began working with someone new, there is always a period of translation to understand what people are talking about.  Interestingly, I think this has always been a flaw in humanity and society in general, but in an ideal world, Covid would be teaching us that perhaps we never really hear and understand what other people mean.  Put more directly, the average person is horrible at communication in general.  Instead however, I fear we are all moving further away from exchanging insightful ideas and more towards hopeful optimism that through meme and common experience we can will others to intuit our goals.",

You have people of all ages from a wide area, sitting in a room with questionable ventilation for an hour+, after spreading a bunch of microdroplets by song, then following it up with tons of hand-to-hand contact and face-to-face chatting contact. \n\nMost churches I went to as a kid would hand-to-hand share offering plates, communion plates, and frequently everybody in the church would shake hands with the pastor at the end of service. \n\nA lot of places follow that service up with sharing food, which is a great tradition, but increases the contact-points for spread even more. \n\nThe cherry on this sundae is that churches are cleaned by volunteers, which provides a wide variety of quality and efficacy in the results of that cleaning. \n\nChristians insisting on meeting in huge groups during this pandemic has been borderline suicidal.",

So for the first example the cancer was either caused by the evil environment or Satan, but God caused the healing.  On the other hand, Calvinists see God as angry and damning everyone to hell but saving a few because reasons.  In that case He did cause the cancer (\"allow it to happen\" which imo is the same thing) but was munificent and spared them in particular.  However, both camps generally believe that God uses people to make them better.  They believe Satan uses people too (like that evil Fauci /s).  I can't for the life of me figure out how they differentiate the two except by what they're told, how much their message aligns with their prior beliefs, and feelings.",

So you can't say \"problem solved, everyone it's safe to go out again!'. And then you have to keep it closed for even longer. Problem is, it could be many, many months until it's safer than the day you shut it down.\n2. It doesn't take much time in shutting a country down until the economy collapses, the money stops flowing, people starve, civil unrest, etc. etc. But before you get to that stage, you have to remember that hospitals, treatment, research, oxygen, ECMO machines, vaccines, and simpler things like electricity and water require tax and MONEY TO FLOW to keep working. Each country will have money in reserve for emergencies, but it will run out very quickly. Yes the virus is moving fast, but not that fast, kind of fast and slow at the same time. It's not going to burn through the world population in the next couple of weeks. It's going to be 6 months plus for that to happen. So I think countries have to be prepared to shut everything down, but at the same time leave it to the very last minute, in order to make sure there's enough money to pay for the stuff for the final end game.

The only people allowed out could be (previously tested) military personnel. \nIn theory this thing should be over with in 2 weeks time.\nI know this would demand a lot of planning and coordinating and would probably cause an increase in deaths by the currently infected - but I argue that this would be smarter than the half hearted effort we are doing now, which probably has to last until there is a vaccine - meaning 1 year!\nSo even if in those 2 weeks 1.500 people die (half of the infected population outside of China). It would be much lower than what we probably going to see in a year from now.\nYou thoughts?"

They are a wonderful invention that provide protection for us, but they aren't a magical forcefield that prevents all bad outcomes. Sometimes a drunk driver hits us head on, or we lose traction and wrap the car around a tree. Seat-belt or not, you can still be gravely injured, or even killed. Does that mean it isn't worth bothering with a seat-belt?\n\nVaccines will help you at least some amount on an individual level, but they also help on a macro level too. The slower that covid spreads (vaccines help prevent some number of infections by requiring a higher viral load), the fewer people get those lottery tickets. It also means fewer mutations, which means more predictability and higher likelihood of better treatment options.\n\nSo yeah, it's worth it for everyone to get the vaccine, even the lower risk population.",

We now both have long covid as we coughed for 3 months straight. \n\nI already had Dysautonomia and POTS pre COVID, but ever since getting COVID I'm now in a never ending sorta flare up that required more extreme treatment protocols.\n\nWe got covid in may, we still occasionally get lung inflammation symptoms, cough and other symptoms. We also constantly still get tested, and test negative.\n\nYou do NOT want long covid.\n\nMy BP has been 84/44 with a pulse of 120 every single morning for months. It feels terrible.",

That totally makes sense! It totally didn't have anything to do with the fact that I have multiple autoimmune diseases or that the virus has had ample time to mutate into new strains. It also couldn't possibly have to do with the fact that so many people have rallied against vaccination and refused to get them / social distance / mask, which gave COVID even more opportunity to mutate into more contagious variants.\n\n\nYeah, I'm not blaming the vaccines for anything but keeping my infection more mild than it would of been.  Vaccines are one of the best tools we have to mitigate the damage and spread of COVID. They may not work 100%, but I'll take any boost I can get over none at all.

Bragging actually needs facts in order to be proper bragging!\n\nExamples: \nWhen your friends talk about how they couldn't get the sold our tickets to their favorite concert without buying it marked up, saying \"I got even better tickets than yours, and I paid wayyy less than what you paid.\"\n\nIn a thread about how difficult it is to pay off student debt, saying \"I didn't go to college and I make $200k per year. I don't have any student loans, so I can afford a 3k sqft house.\" \n\nIn a thread about smokers dying from lung cancer, saying \"I smoked 3 packs a day for 30 years, and I am still alive with no health issues whatsoever. I never tried quitting.\" \n\nAll of those separate statements can be true facts. But it's still bragging that you have or experienced something better than others, and it's pointless other than to make yourself feel good and others feel sad. Many of us had unvaccinated relatives who died from covid after and even before the vaccine even came out. So your saying what you did is bragging that you are better than they are. \n\nI hope you have the self-awareness to understand that there was a reason you posted what you did, and it's not just to \"share facts\".",

I tested at home again August 29 came out negative. Had a PCR test Aug 30 still positive. This past weekend I was at urgent care for lingering symptoms. I was told not to bother repeat testing and I was supposed to have a procedure Sept 2, but because \"i have covid\" they won't do it or touch me for 4 weeks post positive PCR. Also they won't retest me on Sept 27 (during pre-admission testing). I've lost faith in the @ home tests. And I am beginning to doubt PCRs. Why not retest me in 4 weeks?? Weird. Is it because it's possibly faulty and i may be falsely positive.. i don't know, I don't think they really know unfortunately. It's just all contrary to what we've been told to do, or what to expect etc. Just infuriating. I am definitely still having symptoms, congestion, headache, brain fog,  the worst is that I can't smell or taste anything at all!",

Ended up getting Covid twice and worst I suffered was two days of fever.\n\nIt has been a strange journey because when you follow the news you get the impression that you sometimes are observing life on different planets. It's just such big contrasts. In Sweden no lockdowns and very little masking. Was like a 6 month period were we had a bit of widespread mask usage but other than that very few masks in sight. Very I live you literally see no one using a mask for the last 5 months. See like a handful of them at the most per week.\n\nAt the same time we have people who have been isolating, hardly been out for over 2 years and completely overturned their life. And all the while I have just been living my life normally as have many other swedes. It's strange.\n\nI realize people here will think I'm an idiot but I don't care. Sure it could have been a bad choice to keep living my life during the pandemic. Maybe I lucked out? However in my circle of friends and family I don't know anyone who has suffered a lot from Covid ( of course they got sick but not badly so). A lot of those I surround myself with are fitness nuts though but have many that are not. Had one person tell me they had a decline for a couple of months in fitness performance after Covid but other than that nothing when it comes to long Covid. Pretty much everyone has had Covid and among my elderly relatives no one seems to have had lingering effects. No deaths and no hospitalizations.\n\nIt's strange.

Haven't been a problem.\n\nI guess the important thing in my opinion is that everyone is respected and no one is forced to do anything against their will. So if someone wants to go workout in the gym they should be able to for example. It's crazy to deny people taking care of their physical and mental health by shutting them out of gyms.\n\nAlso no one who like me isn't worried about Covid shouldn't be pressured and bullied to get vaccinated.

Those numbers are not in the range of very unlikely. And having had Covid X times without problems unfortunately doesn't tell you about the next one, just check the subreddits here with people fine after first infection and getting wrecked after 3rd or 4th.\n\nI don't want to sound mean with this post, I just hope it might save someone from this fate.

Obviously it's not going to be the same risk for everyone.\n\nI am unvaccinated ( don't care about downvotes so go ahead) and I have lived my life as normal during the pandemic. Reason I didn't get a vaccine was because I'm at a very high fitness level, basically highest amateur level in cycling. Sure I could still get very sick/die but the odds of that happening is very low. I can't compare my situation to someone who is overweight/elderly/have diabetes etc.\n\nHave had Covid twice and worst I suffered was two days of fever. In hindsight I am happy about my decision. It's not unreasonable to think that the vaccines would have caused me to feel ill a greater number of days than Covid has. Sure, like I wrote, something could have happened, but it's like that with so many things in life we do regularly without thinking twice about them. Many things have risks. I don't want to obsess about risks that are very unlikely.\n\nTo me it just didn't seem worth it to get a vaccine for something that most likely wouldn't affect me that much. I would have had to take time off training if I did get vaccinated. Can't do hard cardio training the days following a vaccination ( did 20 hours a week of cycling  for example this winter).\n\nSame thing with masking. Have only used one like less than say 10 or so times in total. Sure it might protect some but it's not worth it to me to have a mask on for 365 days a year just to avoid getting sick for a little bit. I rather get sick a couple of times a year than disrupt my life ( if we assume that masking would prevent it which is far from a guarantee). \n\n( also not an american, perhaps I would have felt forced to take the vaccines if I live in the US not sure)",

At this stage, I'm doing what I can to avoid contracting it, while making some exceptions to keep myself (and immediate family) happy and social (i.e. occasional patio meal or drive-in movie). What I'm HOPING for is to see some studies or data that can give me something more to go off of in terms of long covid. It seems like more and more data is being captured and sifted through now, so that's a good sign. But this whole '2-50% chance' of getting 'long covid' (which is loosely described as any covid symptom lingering longer than 12 weeks, it seems) and includes ALL symptoms from itchiness or malaise to degradation of brain matter or inflammation of your heart is just too up in the air for me.  \n  \nI would LOVE to know what MY risk is. Maybe it can't be exact, but even a super high level ballpark. Okay, white male, 35-45, no known health issues or medications, non-smoker, non/light-drinker. Is there a 1 in 10 chance of 'getting' long covid? Is that a 1 in 10 chance of ANY symptom (even occasional, mild fatigue?)? Is it a 1 in 10 chance of brain implications? 1 in 10,000 for cardiovascular issues? Where are we at in determining the impact of multiple reinfections? If I'm going to pull off the bandaid and 'reintegrate', is it okay if I get covid six times over the next year? Is that 6 times riskier than getting it once? Or 600 times, as reinfections are exponentially more harmful?  \n  \nSo I guess my answer is I'm waiting and seeing. Which, I know, is vague, I just don't know yet exactly what I'm hoping to see.  \n  \nI've told my wife I expect I'll have a good idea of where I'm at over the next couple of months. We've been virtually restrictionless all summer, but it really feels like we're starting a true test now. Offices are mandating people back in, more kids than ever throughout the pandemic are back in class without restrictions, and we're going to get some updated vaccines soon. My guess is, either not much has changed by Winter (in which case, I may open up to doing more) or, there is a *massive* uptick in infections, hospitalizations, work/school absences - in which case, I'll feel relieved for holding back, but depressed as fuck that this is still not improving as much as I'd like it to.  \n  \nAnywho, thanks for asking - hope you and yours keep healthy and happy, regardless of your approach!",

(because it actually might be very delicious)\n\n\nCovid is no joke. Everytime someone tries to downplay it I always tell them that. It either turns into a very awkward silent moment or they just don't believe me.\n\nI hate people sometimes.",

You have a better chance of stopping the virus invasion before it can get too deep into your body's borders.\n\nIf you haven't had a vaccination then it has to start doing that on its own from scratch with no military advisors or weapons stockpiles while the virus is actively taking ground in your body and is killing your cells by turning them into industries to support its invasion and expansion. Your immune system is stuck throwing the hand grenades it has used against previous colds at the virus' tanks while making a fighting retreat until one of its defense firms can produce a weapon that can punch through the tanks' armor. That can take a while, if it ever happens at all, and by then the virus might have captured enough of your body's centers of industries to make your entire internal nation collapse.\n\nIt's important to understand that this isn't perfect, just a big statistical advantage in your chances of success. If you run that war in millions of different timelines then there are going to be some where you're prepared and still lose due to any number of other factors not going in your favor, and there are going to be some where you're unprepared and still manage to luck into anything from finding the right counter weapons on the first try to encountering an undermanned virus invasion force. You're still way more likely to win in the former scenario than the latter, and if you're going to be forced to play the same gamble continuously then you play the odds if you want to win.",

I caught covid this year so I'm pretty sure it was a different strain than yours, and I lost my taste/smell for only a short while. But I remember being depressed because it was just... Missing. No clogged nose etc. All your descriptors are words I've used to describe that experience and when I asked some others I knew who had lost taste/smell they said similar things - muted, texture, sweetness, \"memory\" of taste. \n\nThe one thing that really stood out to me was a Mediterranean garlic sauce and pita bread that I had purchased from a local restaurant before getting sick. In a period where things tasted like \"nothing,\" it tasted like *something.* I was amazed. I don't normally count garlic as a \"spicy\" food either. My brother told me he tasted some whiskey, but he told me it was just \"spicy water\" to him. I could tell my tea was sweetened, which was interesting.\n\nI'm not sure if continuously assaulting your senses with garlic sauce is the way, but who knows. At least you'll taste something. Good luck and hope you recover sometime soon \ud83e\udd1e",

Every community that has had the tightest lockdowns has seen Covid ripping through the populace once restrictions are lifted. Even countries with cultures of masking have seen record breaking waves over the last year.\n\nLet me address this in more detail.\n\ntl;dr version: some countries used NPIs to control original covid; covid now is more infectious and their NPIs are no better, usually weaker, so of course covid is running loose.\n\nlong version:\n\nMasking isn't a binary thing, where you do it or don't do it.  It's a sliding scale -- multiple sliding scales, really: how good is your mask? your fit? Do you cover your nose?  How often do you wear it?  Do you take it off to eat out or attend parties?  And other NPIs are a scale too: how much do you social distance, what exceptions do you make?\n\nA nearly perfect culture of masking would be wearing N95s any time you're out of your household. No bars, no unmasked gyms or parties, restaurants surviving on take-out/delivery/outdoor dining.\n\n*No one* has done that.  In 2020 a bunch of places did the latter things, but people were wearing cloth masks.  Some countries required FFP2, but that was later after restaurants opened, also those are earloop masks so not the best.\n\nJapan masks *a lot more* than the US, certainly, but it's mostly surgical masks, and the restaurant/entertainment industries haven't collapsed, so it's not like they're avoiding high-risk situations.\n\nAlso, the same level of NPIs can stop, or not, different viruses: even the US's lame efforts killed off two flu seasons!  But not covid, because covid is harder.\n\nThe best countries *did* have different combinations of NPIs that controlled or even eliminated original covid.\n\nThen they got vaccines.  Many of them relaxed to varying degrees.\n\nThen Delta came.  It's *more infectious*, plus a bit of immune escape.  Without vaccines, you would need *stronger* NPIs to contain it, and everyone had *weaker* NPIs.  But they also had vaccines that mostly worked.  Japan and Korea still had relative Delta outbreaks -- vaccination and their original NPIs weren't enough to control Delta.  But it was close enough that some minor changes did control it.\n\nVaccination rates went up even more, and people relaxed more.\n\nThen omicron came.  It's at least as inherently infectious as Delta, *and* it laughs at prior immunity.  So you've got a handful of countries that were able to control original covid with some NPIs... but against a more infectious strain, and with NPIs that were no stronger and often weaker, yeah it runs completely loose.\n\nCould they control it again? Probably.  But apart from China, *no one* is trying.  *No other country* has gone \"hmm, this disease is more infectious, we should crank up our NPIs\".  Instead they're all resting on vaccination.  At most some countries are at least sticking to whatever NPIs they still had at the time (like Japan's masking culture), vs. the many countries that are totally giving up.  But since those NPIs + vaccination barely contained Delta, it's not surprise that NPIs + ineffective vaccination aren't containing omicron.\n\nWhat would it take to control omicron?  Well, in terms of immunity *vs. infection*, it's like we're back in early 2020.  So you'd have to back to what worked in 2020, and then some: not just mask mandates, but shutting down bars and indoor dining again, possibly even some lockdowns again.  Remote schooling again, or else school with strong masking and improved ventilation and stuff like outdoor or silent dining, and regular testing.\n\nShould we do all that?  I won't say that; the vaccines *do* still work to mostly keep people from dying.  But it's what would be needed to stop infections against omicron.  2020 immunity vs. infection, so 2020 measures.\n\nBeing 'careful' does work for sufficient values of careful: most of my friends still haven't had covid at all, and hospitals that keep using N95s masks and other precautions, still don't have covid patients infecting their staff.\n\nMaybe the new omicron vaccine will change what's needed, though I'm somewhat skeptical, partly because we're not giving enough of it: one smaller dose, vs. two larger ones like the original doses.",

Still is but slightly better. Right side of my face feels weird. Have to put glaucoma drops in now cause high eye pressure. Side of cheek by nose twitches when one eye is closed. Severe anxiety and panic is an understatement. I checked myself into a pysch ward at the end of March. And after I came out I thought I was having partial aware seizures (auras) because I got these panic attacks, worse than before out of nowhere. The scariest feeling. Not like a typical anxiety attack. And I'm just brushed off. I know doctors hate when you say I researched something. I don't know more than doctors. They studied for years. But I am confident I'm more intelligent than some doctors. Got a 4.0 in my premeds. And not to sound conceited, but it was a cakewalk for me. I really should see a rheumatologist and get to the bottom of if I do have some type of autoimmune issue.",

I had one physical trying to choose a new doctor and that doctor seemed to treat my visit as a one-off rather than trying to establish a new dr/patient relationship. Maybe I would feel differently about risk tolerance if I was still in a more familiar locale and/or around more people I had found to be cautious and trustworthy friends previously. But given the time and place presently, I'm more disappointed that society seems to have largely given up, so I certainly don't trust meeting complete strangers at an indoor gathering now that it feels like we're flying blind. People can go on all day about \"endemic\" or \"just a cold/flu\" but until the death rates are lower than that of a typical flu season my opinion will be that they're saying those prematurely.",

                        "body": "I had a severe lower respiratory infection in Nov 2019. Having mild seasonal allergy triggered asthma and OSA, having a common cold drop into my lungs isn't uncommon, so I weathered it at home, using my rescue inhaler and cpap to assist my breathing. My conversations with a friend in Europe turned to the novel virus found in Wuhan, and how people were using breathing exercises and herbs/vitamins to treat it. I added those to my regimen. But when my pulse/ox dropped to 94%, I suspected pneumonia and nearly called for an ambulance, sleeping in a chair, afraid to lie down. Then my fever broke, for the second time, I waited 24 hrs, then returned to work, wearing a mask, and dependent on my inhaler and menthol cough drops to control the lingering cough. 2 months later the first Covid19 case was detected nearby, and my friend started talking about neural effects, the smell/taste loss, I tested myself on a few strong ones, like citrus/mint/cinnamon and discovered that this was also a lingering symptom. I had severe back pain that I had attributed to returning to overworking, had an xray, and found lower lung damage/congestion. After a lung function test, my taste buds looked like bubble wrap, that turned to the grand canyon. My doctor started me on high dose Vit D. And I am now depending daily on my inhaler. \nI have cognitive issues with memory and vocabulary recall. A chronic convergence deficiency in my right eye that constantly weeps, and chronic nerve pain.\nI can't say it's long covid without a proper titer/genome sequencing, if that's even possible, but I went from being an active hiker/weightlifter, to having to stop halfway up a flight of stairs to catch my breath and rest my legs.\nMy doctor told me it is possible to have long coronavirus symptoms. I have had multiple PCR and antigen tests for CV19 over the past 2 1/2 years all come back negative. I returned to work fulltime a year ago, after the first vaccine, to a warehouse reporting multiple cv19 pos cases weekly, they were providing masks and had incentives for vaccination, but then dropped the mask mandate and have been removing plexiglass barriers and distance requirements since then. \nI know this is anecdotal, but atm I am fully vaxed/boosted twice and being 5 months out from my last shot, looking forward to getting the 5th, an omicron specific booster. With each shot I have seen improvement in my long haul symptoms that return in the form of a bad cold, sore throat, cough, fatigue, as the vaccine protection appears to subside. \nNew cases reported daily at my workplace. I continue to mask, distance and wash/sanitize. And people stare in disbelief.\nThere are links I could add, you'll find most of them on NIH speaking to long covid19, that describe my condition. My doctors continue to treat the symptoms, it's all I can afford. Dr. David Agus has been an invaluable source of information and reassurance. You can follow him on Community and text him directly like I do. His IG @davidbagus The number is in his Bio.\nPlease continue to protect yourselves at whatever level you can. Vet all sources of information and take care and be compassionate around people like me who are struggling. I appreciate it. My elderly Mom and 99 yr old grandfather appreciate it. I remain optimistic, looking forward to endemic CV19, and annual vaccine boosters and general health improvement worldwide. \nSorry for the long post. It's just the tip of the iceberg for myself and many others working alongside you, unable to afford self isolation, as government assistance was removed last year. Please be kind.\nEOM\n[Edited for multiple typos/grammatical errors].",

Those with compromised immune systems and the elderly are considered at higher risk of dying from COVID-19.\n> \n> Some doctors have suggested that Trudeau may already have the coronavirus but has no symptoms. Trudeau has not been tested for the virus, as most doctors recommend against testing people who are asymptomatic.\n> \n> In Camilla\u2019s case, Dr. Fish said it\u2019s possible that proper hygiene could\u2019ve played a role in her negative test results. However, she added that it\u2019s entirely possible that Camilla could test positive later.\n\nI think we're just disagreeing on semantics.\n\nFrom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection#Signs_and_symptoms :\n\n> In certain cases, infectious diseases may be asymptomatic for much or even all of their course in a given host. In the latter case, the disease may only be defined as a \"disease\" (which by definition means an illness) in hosts who secondarily become ill after contact with an asymptomatic carrier. **An infection is not synonymous with an infectious disease, as some infections do not cause illness in a host.** [17]\n\nAs i said, infection = virus entered your system in minimum viable amount.

The ones in whom the virus has entered their system but developed no symptoms are referred to as asymptomatic, but they are counted as infected and factored into IFR. IFR is a statistical estimate and not a counted number, unlike CFR which is a counted number. CFR varies widely depending on the healthcare system and its various aspects and parts and is not an indicator of the disease itself, but of the disease and of the healthcare system.\n\nIndividuals being \"susceptible\" or not does not enter either calculation, it seems. Either you were infected or you were not.\n\nThere is the point of minimum feasible viral load, which they seem to have not figured out yet (i.e. 1,234 viruses in one place), but they decide that it should be one number for everyone.\n\nThere is another omission in my earlier post, which is that herd immunity confers a good deal of protection to everyone not infected, and herd immunity is (R0 - 1)/R0 % of a given population, which means for a globalised world it would be, assuming R0=3, 67% of 7 billion which is about 4.67 billion people. In practice, it might be much lower. R reduces drastically if you take steps like masks (big one), staying at home(big one), social distancing, temporary lockdowns, etc. Therefore, say with an R of 1.5, you would get herd immunity at 33% infected (presymptomatic, asymptomatic or symptomatic).\n\nThe point I was making was that IFR may be <= 0.5% but potentially everyone is vulnerable to getting infected if we do not distance, which means a small percentage of a big number is still a pretty big number and therefore everyone is taking it seriously.\n\n----\n\nNow, in this post, I would like to add that the virus obviously seems to affect the rich, the poor and the powerful equally and therefore, human power structures have begun to respect it, unlike in the case of cold and flu. Nobody shuts down schools for the flu or for tuberculosis or malaria, even though poor people die in the 100s of 1000s annually from those diseases, but most of them are poor and/or don't matter.",

Says preliminary data so unlikely peer reviewed.\n\n>All-cause deaths following vaccination\n\n>In the 28 days following vaccination, no increase in risk was observed for all-cause deaths. A statistically significant decrease was observed for participants 60 years or older in the 28 days following vaccination (RI = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.94 -0.99).\n\n>Cardiac-related deaths following vaccination\n\n>In the 28 days following vaccination, a statistically significant increase in cardiac-related deaths was detected for the entire study population (RI = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.03 -1.12). Stratifying by age group revealed RIs were significantly higher for age groups 25 -39 (RI = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.35 -3.47) and 60 or older (RI = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01 -1.10). The remaining age groups failed to reach statistical significance.\n\n>Cardiac-related deaths by age group, vaccination type, and sex following vaccination\n\n>To determine which group may be driving the increased risk of cardiac-related deaths in the primary analysis, the vaccination analysis was further stratified by sex, vaccination type, and age groups. Tables 2 and 3 present the sex specific results for cardiac-related deaths following vaccination stratified by age group and vaccination type. Risk was significantly higher during the risk period for males (RI = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.03 -1.15) but not for females (RI = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.98 -1.11). Concerning vaccination type, males receiving mRNA vaccination had significantly higher risk (RI = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.05 -1.18), while males receiving vaccinations that were not mRNA/unknown had significantly lower risk (RI = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.58 -0.98). RIs for females stratified by vaccination type revealed a similar pattern, with lower, non-significant estimates. Among the subgroups evaluated, males aged 18 -39 had the highest risk (RI = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.16 -3.35).\n\n>Discussion/Conclusion\n\n>In this statewide study of vaccinated Florida residents aged 18 years or older, COVID-vaccination was not associated with an elevated risk for all-cause mortality. COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a modestly increased risk for cardiac-related mortality 28 days following vaccination. Results from the stratified analysis for cardiac-related death following vaccination suggests mRNA vaccination may be driving the increased risk in males, especially among males aged 18 -39. Risk for both all-cause and cardiac-related deaths was substantially higher 28 days following COVID-19 infection. The risk associated with mRNA vaccination should be weighed against the risk associated with COVID-19 infection.\n\n>Limitations\n\n>**These data are preliminary, based on surveillance data, and should be interpreted with caution**. The results have several limitations:\n\n>While this method has been used to assess risk of death following COVID-19 vaccination,2 it violates the assumption that an event does not affect subsequent exposure (for mRNA vaccines), which may introduce bias. 6 Further, it does not consider the multidose vaccination schedule required for mRNA vaccination.\n\n>**This study cannot determine the causative nature of a participant\u2019s death. We used death certificate data and not medical records. COVID testing status was unknown for those who did not die of/with COVID. Cardiac-related deaths were ascertained if an ACME code of I3-I52 were on their death certificate, thus, the underlying cause of death may not be cardiac-related.**\n\n>The finding that the Janssen vaccine was more protective than mRNA vaccine against mortality within 28 days of vaccination could be due to confounding and needs to be further evaluated. It is likely that the populations who received COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and the Johnson vaccine are different, something we were not able to ascertain in this analysis. It is possible that the population who received the Johnson vaccine was younger and healthier than those receiving the mRNA vaccines. The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines were released more than 2 months earlier than the Janssen vaccine when the recommendations were limited to those 65 and older.\n\nI emphasized some information about in the limitations. JFC.... A governor should not be using this **preliminary** data to make any decisions.\n\nNot at all shocking however for a typically anti-science political party to use science as incorrectly as possible.",

And contrast that with Covid, which is common, possibly more common in younger men (data not provided in the paper, but younger men tend to be greater risk takers), and it's associated mortality. \n\nHoever, rhe paper appears to be suggesting to use a non-mRNA vaccine in younger men. It is *not suggesting* that vaccines are omitted.\n\nHete is their conclusion:\nIn this statewide study of vaccinated Florida residents aged 18 years or older, COVID-vaccination was not associated with an elevated risk for all-cause mortality. COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a modestly increased risk for cardiac-related mortality 28 days following vaccination. Results from the stratified analysis for cardiac-related death following vaccination suggests mRNA vaccination may be driving the increased risk in males, especially among males aged 18 - 39. Risk for both all-cause and cardiac-related deaths was substantially higher 28 days following COVID-19 infection. The risk associated with mRNA vaccination should be weighed against the risk associated with COVID-19 infection.",

I just got my second booster on Thursday, and I really have to wonder how well the series of one shot and two boosters really stack up against the others -- especially when the last one I got was nearly a year ago, and especially against long-COVID (which is my main concern). They did that study that found that a Moderna full dose works really well as a booster to J&J, but then they gave us a half dose and shrugged their shoulders and we never heard anything about it again (that I know of). \n\nI'm just eagerly awaiting an intra-nasal vaccine.",

They somewhat casually write that off as due to confounding variables (I hate when studies pay attention to what they want to see, but then ignore 'confounding' variables if it might change their hypothesis).\n\nI'd like to see that studied by a more unbiased source.

We both rapid tested because we had a hint of a sore throat. However, I started having long-COVID symptoms, despite thinking I never had it.\n\nMy doctor said it\u2019s pretty common and highly likely I was exposed and infected for a short period but my immune system immediately attacked it it to the point it didn\u2019t register on the tests. But the immune system response itself could be responsible for later effects. \n\nIt makes sense, too because this was Omicron over last Christmas. When you consider how contagious it is, sleeping next to someone with it would be ~8 hours of close indoor contact. \n\nI mean, who knows? Maybe some people just don\u2019t get it easily?",

For a group of 100 kids, how many would get infected within a relatively short timeframe & develop severe COVID without the vax? For another group of 100 kids, all getting the vax, how many would experience severe side effects?\n\nThat analysis worked out in favor of the vaccines, even for the highest risk group (which I believe was young men 12 to 17).\n\nAlso, I have a hard time seeing how anyone who has a severe reaction to the vaccine would somehow fare better against the disease itself. The vaccine makes a tiny portion of the spike protein & your immune system reacts. The virus does that and more. Seems like a pretty straightforward idea that people who have bad reactions to the vaccine are the ones who would've had severe COVID without it.",

The tweaks to the new vaccine mirror the changes that occurred in BA.4 & BA.5 themselves.

But let me list the differences in situations.\n\nThe 30k was a double blind carefully controlled study. It was an efficacy study, which showed the vaccine to be extremely effective, and also insuring safety for side effects of incidence about 1/5000. \n\nGetting the vaccination is a benefit/risk choice. At the time, the Uk varisnt was around iirc, and the % chance of getting hospitalized if you got it was much higher. Therefore, you would have been ready to accept a slightly unsafer vaccine (although, after jabbing millions, it proved to be extremely safe, much more than the ~1/5000 that the trial could ensure, and then there was really no reason for anyone not to get it).\n\nNow, for this vaccine :\n-There has been no efficacy study. Previously, smaller studies about booster with omicron spike didn\"t show a dramatic increase in protection from infection. In any case, without efficacy study we simply do not know how well does this vaccine work. There are educated guesses with antibody measurements, but those do not always correlate with protection, the only way to know efficacy is to do the study.\n- Most people have either gotten covid, the jab or both. Couple that with the fact that omicron produces much milder symptoms and for people in good health, the chances of complications by covid have dropped significantly. For me, a healthy guy in his 20s who is vaccinated and gotten omicron, the chance of complication by a further infection are very low (looking at hospitalisation per million, its probably on the order of 1/10M in my case).\n-Compare the above odds with a vaccine that yes, had a safety study, but on 600 participants. While unlikely, if there was a serious side effect with 1/1000 incidence, it would not appear in such a study. However, it will definitely be noticed once a million people get the jab.\n\nI really don't think this is a hot take, it is pure probabilites and risk/benefit. I lose almost nothing to wait a few months to ensure that the jabs safety and efficacy.\n\nOf course, for more vulnerable people, it is another story, and the balance of probabilities might change.",

That is relatively simple, but remember the virus can take 10-14 days between infection and symptoms. So potentially, you could have an exposure during your one week study and not see a second degree case until almost a month later. So at a minimum you are looking at 5 weeks of JUST data collection.\n\nNow you have to look at the data. Can you conclusively say that person A transmitted to person B? Only if everything is properly contact traced and genetically sequenced. That is not easy and can take time to contact everyone and piece together the timeline, especially with high rates of the virus in the general population and asymptomatic infection. \n\nWhen you are developing a product, you have to focus on certain things. Usually, baseline performance and safety are two of those. Smaller details get pushed to the side until resources become available. Mask mandates wouldn't go away until a significant portion of the population is vaccinate anyway, so why rush the data to help make that decision? You really want to make sure you get it right.\n\nThere are so many more factors to this, but this vaccine is \"scientifically\" approved because they properly applied the scientific method to prove its safety and efficacy. The data they currently have( and what you are proposing) does not meet the definition of \"good science\", so it wouldn't be approved by anyone in the community. For good reason.",

This question was not studied as part of the clinical trials. Until there's certainty, the whole point is to continue wearing masks until everyone/a greater proportion of your personal network (family/friends/coworkers) is vaccinated. \n\n>Will the COVID vaccine prevent me from infecting others?\n\n>The answer is, we don't know. Clinical trials of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines found that both do a good job preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease, including severe COVID-19. However, the trials did not measure whether a person who is vaccinated is less likely to spread the virus to someone else.\n\n>It's possible that the vaccines protect against COVID-19 disease by preventing a person from becoming infected in the first place. However, it's also possible that the vaccine protects a person from COVID-19 illness, but does not prevent a person from becoming infected. In other words, a vaccinated person may have replicating virus in their nose and throat even if they are protected from becoming sick.\n\n>But does that mean that you have enough virus in your nose and throat to infect someone else? Not necessarily. It's possible that the immune response triggered by the vaccine, which protects you from becoming sick, also reduces the amount of virus in your nose and throat to a point where you are unlikely to spread it to someone else. But we need more research to know for sure.\n\n>The bottom line? If you're among the first groups of people to get vaccinated, it's best to continue wearing masks and maintaining physical distance in order to protect others who haven't yet gotten the vaccine.\n\n[https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus#:~:text=The%20answer%20is%2C%20we,protected%20from%20becoming%20sick](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus#:~:text=The%20answer%20is%2C%20we,protected%20from%20becoming%20sick.)",
