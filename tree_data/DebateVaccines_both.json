This downregulation of ACE2 by COVID-19 results in increases in the substrates of ACE2, AngII and BK.6 COVID-19 infection also shows evidence of an increase in HA synthase 2 expression which will upregulate the production of HA and can lead to fluid retention and decreased gas permeability and acute respiratory distress syndrome often seen in COVID-19 patients.6,8 In response to the infection, the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, is upregulated. This overexpression of IL-6 indirectly causes an increase in B1Rs on the cell surface and also indirectly causes the downregulation of SERPINA12, a suppressor for bradykinin, subsequently increasing the cell\u2019s affinity for the uninhibited bradykinin.

We should be cheering this on having COVID parties like families did with chicken pox back in the day.  I have been pretty clear and consistent with my message and stance. Do you. Let everyone else alone. But you continue to support fascism when you allow governments to get away with basically anything in times of a man-made \"emergency\".

Second, we decomposed the growth in cases into test growth and positive test ratio growth to intuitively visualize the components of case growth.

They wear mask anyways too; Therefore, no mandates necessary. Vaccination *does* help reduce healthcare and societal burden, but he didn't make that point. Nobody argued that there should be universal vaccination policies/mandates today.

As mentioned there\u2019s quite a ton of confounders to adjust for, and even then it\u2019s just a correlation. Things like pop. density, infection seroprevalence, climate, NPIs etc. For example, rural counties have always had less Covid, and due to various factors, less vaccination too. Some countries with low vaccination rates had pretty much zero Covid. Other confounders include availability and costs of tests, number of tests vs population, test positivity rate, and climate. Regions with resources to have highly vaccinated populations are the same ones with resources for high volume testing. \n\nI did mention if you look at Fig.2, it seems to contradict their title. Looking at vaccination rates of counties by cases per 100,000 (not based on randomly-chosen weeks), there *is* a good correlation between the two. You can chuck the data into a Pearson\u2019s correlation.\n\nIf you look at the Pubpeer thread and the response letter I linked, they also mention some examples. \n\nAgain these are still just correlations, at most you just look at them for fun.\n\nThere\u2019ve been plenty of studies done on **vaccine effectiveness** against infection and transmission, I can link some if you want. Those are actually useful.\n\nThis conversation is quite irrelevant now with Omicron, as vaccines are shit now (against infection).",

It\u2019s a letter/correspondence with a very brief/basic analysis. *Maybe* you could use it to say there isn\u2019t a correlation in the broad geographical context but the letter doesn\u2019t even succeed In showing this convincingly either. Uses arbitrary 1 week window and very naive metric of percentage change, comparing countries at different epidemic phases, strange inclusion/exclusion criteria, no adjustment for confounders whatsoever and more\u2026 It doesn\u2019t seem to add anything to the existing data and research, it looks to be basically just descriptions of raw data off Google/OurWorldinData. But it\u2019s a letter/correspondence which gives it more leeway. If you don't control for absolutely anything with an arbitrary week snapshot of something that moves in waves, I think it\u2019s unsurprising that you're going to have a hard time.\n\nLooking at vaccination rates of counties by cases per 100,000(not based on randomly-chosen weeks), there's a good correlation between the two. In fact, Fig.2 seems to contradict their title. This is disregarded in favour of something much more arbitrary as the primary outcome.\n\n[Pubpeer thread](https://pubpeer.com/publications/693A0D3B374ACED0103ADDEA0D905E)\n\n[An official response correspondence/letter to the journal outlining the issues with the letter](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-021-00817-6)\n\nr/COVID19 [thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/q14z45/increases_in_covid19_are_unrelated_to_levels_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nBonus r/medicine [thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/q2c9od)",

UK, Germany, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand all reversing. Now data is now clearly showing the 3 jabs model is definitely reducing hospitalization and case severity. \n\nTo me it looks pretty good given we have never seen the amount of variants for any virus before.

Given the uniqueness of Covid I would say we have done a very good job.\n\nI think you need to get your head out of your, arse, look around and stop assuming people are scared or stupid when it comes to this pandemic.

Then it will be four doses and so on. And if you do not meet the current definition you are counted as being unvaccinated. That\u2019s how the numbers are all skewed in favor That they desire.",

I had a gut feeling to not get it from the start but didn\u2019t listen to my intuition. My neurologist assured me that it would be fine. My group of friends all got it too. So I kind of felt pressured to get it. \n\nAnd as mentioned by someone on here, they removed all opposing views online so it was hard to see the truth. \n\nThen I got the booster in November 2021 and started to feel extremely tired. By February I started having heart rate issues, light sensitivity, and mobility issues. At one point I couldn\u2019t move to get to the bathroom. I am 26 years old so I was like no way this is happening to me at such a young age. Went to all types of docs and they all said I\u2019m fine but I\u2019m NOT FINE.\n\nThis is when I was like wtf and started questioning the vaccine. I kept on googling vaccine side effects and came across reddit. So I started researching more and saw how tiktok deletes all the videos of people explaining their stories about the vaccine injuries. Twitter suspends all the accounts talking about it. Facebook removes posts taking about vaccine injuries. I saw one article about a Canadian man who received compensation from the side effects of the vaccine.That\u2019s when it hit me that this whole thing is pure EVIL. \n\nHow is it normal to get all these vaccines in such a short span of time? Some people are on their fifth vaccine.I don\u2019t get how people are still trying to justify the vaccine? I made a mistake and I admit it. I was definitely bamboozled by the media fear-mongering. In fact, I felt a little bit like I was hypnotized. I\u2019m not even joking. When I started having health issues after the booster, that\u2019s when I felt like I woke up.\n\nI should\u2019ve known something wasn\u2019t right when they started censoring Donald Trump on Twitter. They were preparing from then. It all makes sense now. I\u2019m not a Trump fan btw just something I observed that didn\u2019t seem right from 2020. \n\nLesson learned for next time to trust my intuition.",

Much like the flu, symptoms like fever, headache, tiredness etc are common after a vaccine and can affect sperm count or the menstrual cycle, just like the flu can.\n\n>Who decides who\u2019s respected snd who is not? What are you basing these value judgements on?\n\nYou said 'respected' doctors had spoken out against the vaccine, so you must have your own criteria for that judgement. I would describe a doctor as well respected if they are well thought of by their peers because their research, analyses and methods are scientifically sound.\n\nOn the basis there is no data supporting many of Byram Bridle's claims, he doesn't meet that definition.",

The covid vaccine was extremely urgent and well funded so all phases were carried out concurrently. \n\nAspirin is more dangerous than an mRNA jab, but the subject is complex and easily misrepresented for political and financial gain. There are plenty of young virologists working in research, are you seeing dozens of unknowns posting their dodgy findings on social media? Nope.\n\nProminent antivaxxers are selling alternative remedies, or raking in donations via patreon, or are politically affiliated with the opposition. They seldom provide any data, and research disproving their claims is freely available, but people make up their minds and then look for supporting information afterwards, just like you said you were 'certain' and 'time' rather than existing evidence will prove you right.\n\nI'm quite happy to evaluate the accuracy of our beliefs but I already showed you beyond debate that there's no evidence SADS numbers are rising, and you remained convinced. You don't feel compelled to underpin your own claims with evidence, which shows that you'll accept claims without evidence from others - as long as they fit a conclusion you've already reached - and will reject claims with evidence if they don't.",

Neither has conducted any research on vaccines. Neither supported their claims with research. Neither sought consensus for their analyses or sought to have their ideas evaluated by other scientists. Both foisted dangerous, speculative and false ideas on the public via the media, and recommended unapproved drugs.\n\nAll of that is outrageous, and both are qualified and experienced enough to know it's outrageous. Bhakdi was dumped by his publisher, condemned by the University of Mainz, and lost his non-profit status. Yeadon's ex colleagues have condemned his behaviour, as have dozens of other scientists. No-one credible supports these scumbags.\n\nThere's tons of shady shit there, *tons*.\n\nAnd Gates? You haven't produced a thing, just your *suspicions*.",

Sometimes they add\u00a0zinc\u00a0as well because the hydroxychloroquine works by letting zinc into cells. Another major one is\u00a0ivermectin\u00a0which is an off patent antiparasitic and it also happens to have antiviral effects as well. Then the last two I guess would be\u00a0azithromycin\u00a0which is an off patents antimicrobial but it also has anti-inflammatory properties which we know about, and then finally inhaled steroids like\u00a0Budesonide\u00a0commonly used in asthma.\n\nHydroxychloroquine, zinc, ivermectin, azithromycin and budesonide are *all* now contraindicated in the treatment of covid, no evidence of efficacy exists. It's not normal for a Dr to recommend multiple unapproved drugs like this.\n\n>I had a very good friend of position, a Doctor Tess Lawrie in the UK and she was reporting that they were writing up reviews of new collective technical information from around the world and it was clear in her case that\u00a0ivermectin was working really well, and they were literally suppressing the manuscript, at journal level,\u00a0so I\u2019m talking about medical journals that you would think of as being beyond reproach. Someone was leaning on them and\u00a0refusing to publish papers\u00a0that are written to at least the same quality as everything else they were publishing.\n\nAccusing medical journals of fraud? Because they won't endorse unapproved therapeutics. Really??\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8500726/\n\nTess Lawrie is balls deep selling ivermectin and created\u00a0a GoFundMe\u00a0to raise money for costs associated with the BIRD Group\u2019s work, which was titled \u201cHelp us get a lifesaving drug approved for COVID-19.\u201d\n\nNone of this is *remotely* normal or acceptable, and gives a strong indication where his motives lie.",

This is nonesense. Threats don't pacify. Covid hasn't pacified. I've had my shots, as has everyone close to me and we still don't trust government as far as we can throw them. Hunger causes revolution, not compliance. \n\nhttps://www.the-latest.com/hunger-spark-ignites-revolutions\n\nhttps://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520343375/hungry-for-revolution\n\nhttps://grist.org/food/the-people-are-hungry-the-link-between-food-and-revolution/\n\nI'm willing to bet that you're not so sure Putin is such a bad guy anymore, am I right? You used to think so, but right around the same time you realised covid was a hoax, you changed your mind. That's true for an awful lot of Americans at a time he's threatening the Western world with nuclear war. You think that's an accident?",

A factory I visit has a huge aerospace division - it's rammed to the rafters with insanely bright scientists, all vaccinated, all masking. Why only a handful of individuals on telegram? Why not whole research divisions? There isn't a single one. Huh, strange.",

All I care about is scientific consensus. \n\nWe've studied this thing to death *as a species* and the results tell us:\n- covid is best managed by boosted vaccination\n- covid can cause long term damage even in young people without comorbidities\n- transmission is best managed by quarantine, social distancing & masking.\n\nFor that not to be true would mean that all governments, the world's media, courts of justice and every person in the health industry ON THE PLANET have conspired together in a lie.\n\nA conspiracy on that scale has never happened in the history of time, it's simply not plausible.\nThat a handful of opportunists are peddling misinformation for profit - which has happened during every health crisis ever - is very plausible. It would be highly unusual if that *wasn't* happening.\n\n>The PCR test for Covid was created by Drosden in January with no live virus samples but computer code sent from China. The inventor of the PCR test said it is not a diagnostic tool. Sir Patrick Vallance said it cannot tell if you are sick or infectious. Fauci said if it is run over 25/30 cycles it is useless.\n\nYou're swallowing a lot of bullshit whole.\n\nhttps://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=director-of-the-u-s-national-institute-for-allergy-and-infectious-diseases-anthony-fauci-stated-that-large-numbers-of-positive-covid-19-cases-may-arise-from-oversensitive-tests-that-pick-up-mere-frag\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-pcr-idUSKBN24420X\n\nhttps://fullfact.org/online/pcr-test-mullis/\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-who-pcr-idUSL1N2M10ID\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-who-instructions-pcr-guidan-idUSKBN2A429W\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-tests-who.html\n\n>As you deemed yourself too superior to watch a channel 4 you tube link\n\nI don't take information from YouTube (and neither should you) because it's laborious and difficult to verify.

A 2% death rate sounds like nothing to us, but in reality the effect is massive, we aren't equipped to cope with hordes of sick needing the same care all at once.\n\nThere is now overwhelming evidence masks do effectively protect others but my position has always been that it's something I'm happier to be wrong about doing, than not doing. I'm a woman, I wear high heels and bras and shit, a mask doesn't touch the discomfort I choose to endure for vanity. If it turned out the only purpose a mask served was to remind people to take a little extra care, it was worth it to me. Literally no skin off my teeth - that some see it as a loss of freedom is very odd. By law we have to wear pants. Interfere with my right to protest or to vote and I'll have something to say, but a mask? No problem.",

If you don't believe people will pay to have public trust in government and vaccines undermined (as evidenced by the airline ceo funding anti lockdown research) then I don't know what to tell you. Dismissing their claims hinges mainly on thinking critically: examining whether there's evidence for what they say - peer reviewed research routinely undermines their claims. There is a very high degree of bias - many are selling alternative treatments and heavily connected to politics - that you can't attribute to the medical fraternity collectively.\n\nYou're happy to assume regulation is meaningful (emergency authorisation, trial phases) and that [Pfizer's](https://www.covid-datascience.com/post/do-the-recent-80k-pages-of-pfizer-documents-released-really-show-vaccine-efficacy-was-only-12) research is accurate when you want to prove a point, but write off all the same sources as corrupt and unreliable the rest of the time. Are regulation and research meaningful or not?\n\nWhat will you do if you get sick? Go to a doctor? Why would you trust them? They get their information and prescribe drugs from government controlled villains. Are they only lying about this? Why? Why now? If they are so easily corruptible.\n\nYour theory doesn't make logical sense. It's no secret that if you want a docile population, then locking them up, plunging them into poverty and jabbing needles into their kids isn't the way to go about it. Throughout history, hungry people revolt, they do not comply. Boris Johnson couldn't even have a couple of beers without nearly losing his job, this is the level of intelligence we're dealing with in government, with rare exception. So who are these masterminds? Even Gates couldn't pull the wool over your eyes, so who is so spectacularly clever and efficient?\n\nIt's not important *who* decides what's true, it's *how* we decide what's true. That's the thing to examine.\n\nhttps://www.open.ac.uk/research/news/how-spot-conspiracy-theory-when-you-see-one\n\nhttps://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/detecting-conspiracy-theory/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor",

Yeadon is a proponent of Ivermectin, and involved in politics, both of which are highly profitable. To say he's been silenced or bravely risked a career when he's achieved celebrity and become a household name is obviously ludicrous, but again, it just flies overhead at 1000ft.\n\n>Who appointed these people arbiters of truth?Who checks the fact checkers.\n\nJust because social media makes it seem everyone's opinion is equally valid, doesn't mean that's how the world works. It certainly isn't how science works. Scientific knowledge is concensus based on what can be proven, which is what fact checking measures, not opinion.\n\nWhere's the self awareness in accusing me of relying on faith, having admitted you don't look for evidence? You repeatedly demonstrate you have no base knowledge of science or medicine at all. With scant exception, all peer reviewed scientific research *globally* shows vaccines safe and effective, antivaxxers have failed to provide *any* studies to the contrary. But, reason and logic didn't get you into this mess, so I'm not going to have any joy using either to get you out.",

Or the pharmaceutical companies.You seem to have it the wrong way around.\nAs for Fauci how has this man got any credibility has he changes his mind with the wind.\nWould you agree that once you have been infected with Covid then you are henceforth immune?[https://igorchudov.substack.com/p/dramatic-decrease-in-births-in-germany](https://igorchudov.substack.com/p/dramatic-decrease-in-births-in-germany)",

You've written off all research, all claims and all oversight by several thousand PhD educated individuals, so please explain why this guy's qualifications are suddenly sacrosanct. Especially since I've provided evidence he isn't truthful?\n\nIt's wild that you'll call others gullible while seeking no verification and in fact, flat out ignoring what's put under your nose. The fact you call them *brave* - yikes. Doesn't that alert you to the fact you've abandoned objectivity? Why doesn't that alarm you? Why does your scepticism only go one way? A lot of those 'experts' *are* heavily involved in the pharma industry, they *are* elites. They *are* profiting to the tune of billions.

Natural immunity is good, but vaccine acquired immunity is preferable because it doesnt carry the risks which come with infection. Why do you care about natural immunity if you don't think it poses any risk to you? \n\nI won't watch YouTube links, link to information in written form so I can verify it.",

The claims made by these people ARE NOT EVIDENCED IN FACT. Once again, science has fuck all to do with the opinion of ANYONE, regardless of their credentials, it's based on repeated testing and experiment, what can be PROVEN. Any analysis has to be supported by data which meets qualitative and quantitative thresholds. Criticism of their conclusions is underpinned by a gargantuan body of research. Yeadon ADMITTED his claims about infertility were not back by any research whatsoever.\n\n>Yeadon has nothing to gain\n\nLol. So he's simultaneously really smart and yet he has failed to monetised a social media following of tens of thousands, and isn't being paid for appearances. He's become a household name but personally gained nothing in the process? Don't be so dense. Every last one of these cunts has a financial motive and usually also a political one.

The results were much lower than official data, thus creating a\u00a0conflict of interest.\n\nSucharit Bhakdi\n\n>In 2021, Bhakdi was a founder of the new German political party\u00a0dieBasis, which emerged out of the \"Querdenken\" political movement, standing as a candidate in the\u00a02021 German federal election\u00a0in\u00a0North Rhine-Westphalia.[49][50][51]\u00a0In April 2021, the antisemitism commissioner for the state of\u00a0Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\u00a0identified the Querdenken movement as providing space for antisemitic conspiracy theories, noting that Bhakdi singled out the German-Jewish minister of education in\u00a0Schleswig-Holstein,\u00a0Karin Prien, as \"poisoning our children with CO2\".\n\nDolores Cahill \n\n>Promoted Hydroxychloroquine. \n\n>In late December 2020, Cahill claimed in\u00a0a filmed discussion\u00a0that, regarding the COVID-19 vaccines being rolled out in the UK, \u201cmost of the elderly, most of those people will have serious adverse events or will die in the next few months.\u201d\n\nI can go on and on. The site also quotes the Daily Mail, a publication so widely accepted as unreliable and as a source of propaganda that many platforms prohibit links to it.\n\nMy point is, there are glaring, provable falsehoods and conflicts of interest associated with all of those experts. If you make an effort to check their claims, you'll find they don't stand up to scrutiny. It's a bit silly for you to reserve your skepticism for big institutions, who are under stringent regulation, yet apply none to people who have been repeatedly proven wrong and who have transparent political and personal motives to misrepresent the facts.\n\nYou can't deny it's easier to corrupt an individual than an organisation. It's easier for the bias of an individual to influence their analysis than for the findings of thousands of scientists to be biased . These 'experts' do not have *consensus* which in and of itself tells you they are wrong, because science *is* consensus. \n\nThis sums it up quite well:\n\n\"People often talk about \u201cbelieving the science,\u201d but science has value precisely because you don\u2019t have to just believe it. It\u2019s verifiable, and someone\u2019s already verified it. The knowledge it produces has value exactly because the experiments can be done and redone and checked by someone else. Science is not a set of facts that are only available to people with certain letters after their name: it\u2019s an institution, and a process, and a community.\u00a0\n\nNobody falls into a COVID-conspiracy hole because they\u2019re wicked, cruel or corrupt. People usually fall in with the best of intentions: they\u2019re worried about health, welfare, or government overreach. When COVID-truther activists say their only motivation is to tell the truth, I mostly believe them. But when a scientist says this, it makes them less credible, not more so. That\u2019s because they know how hard it is to get at the truth, and they know what kind of support that requires from colleagues, mentors, and institutions \u2013 exactly the kind of support that Yeadon and Malone have decided they no longer need.\"\n\nhttps://www.logically.ai/articles/scientists-vs-science-interviews-with-mike-yeadon-and-robert-malone?hs_amp=true",

The risk of myocarditis in kids is miniscule but it's still a risk, and the JCVI always errs on the side of caution. The data was constantly changing due to shifting rates of infection and transmissibility, new research emerging on natural immunity, changing legislation - a dozen moving targets. This research is freely available to you. But yeah, *obviously* changes to policy must be corruption. Fuck me dead.\n\nCovid is surging again, *of course* people need to have up to date inoculations. Why the fuck would they spend billions on a vaccine and not make sure its put to effective use?\n\nWhat about any of this is too complex for you? The same considerations have been taken by other international advisory bodies who've arrived at similar conclusions. Dead kids are of no benefit to any government, the population would become resolutely noncompliant and they need people to do as they're told, keep voting for them, keep earning, keep spending and keep paying tax. That's blindingly straightforward.",

Probably the most well-known proponent of this viewpoint is former Fox News personality Glenn Beck, who has persistently warned of the inevitability of hyperinflation, lawlessness, and bread riots in the wake of QE and other Fed initiatives to inject liquidity and expand the money supply.\"\n\nWhich is more likely:\n\nEITHER\n\nCovid been used in a global banking conspiracy.

Hundreds of millions of people have worked on the mitigation of this disease worldwide, in hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories and universities.\n\nThe advice given in the UK was broadly in line with advice given in Argentina, Poland, Timbuktu, as was the death rate, pattern of transmission, vaccine rollout etc.\n\nA conspiracy on that scale is not plausible. How on earth could anyone motivate a global lie on that scale? Money? How? A cash lump sum or monthly direct debit. And no-one in a bank noticed? No-ones spilled the beans? Everyone's telling the same perfect story with no slip ups? To introduce a global currency that most people aren't aware of and the ones that are don't give a toss? In a way that's been detrimental to trust in authority across the board?\n\nThere's sweet fuck all that lines up here. Zilch. Nada. These are the ramblings of a barefoot drunk in a parking lot.

That's literally what science *IS* - establishing probability by repeating the same experiment and achieving the same result most of the time. It's got precisely ZERO to do with what anyone says, it's exclusively based on facts, on what can be proven.\n\nResearch is carried out and the results are published as a pre-print. At this stage more than half of it is fraud or inaccurate, sample sizes are too small to draw firm conclusions, methodology is sloppy. Other labs then pick up the studies and attempt to replicate the results. Most research doesn't progress past this point. \n\nWhen unaffiliated researchers can achieve the same results, they apply for funding to conduct research on a much bigger scale, with sample sizes in the thousands. All of this happens with the oversight of multiple layers of independent regulation, which exists with the express purpose of policing big pharma and government policy - how do you think existing safe pharmaceuticals were developed? \n\nThe same people who regulate the quality of food in our supermarkets, health supplements - literally everything you put in your mouth - are responsible for this. Do you grow all your own food or do you shop for it without a fleeting thought that what you buy might kill you? How many times has any of it put you in hospital? Is it just possible then that they might be doing their job, and you put your trust in them all day every day because subconsciously you acknowledge that they are?\n\n'Truth' is very difficult to establish but scientific 'truth' (that is, verified reproducable facts) is one of the closest ways humanity can get to saying something is true.\n\nIt's alarming that, regardless of the fact you have life expectancy of 80+, enjoy radio, WiFi, TV, painkillers at 35p a pop, have seen multiple diseases eradicated, organ transplants, a man on the moon - you can STILL dismiss science in it's entirety. That is downright bewilderingly insane. And yet you swallow the word of discredited doctors, who claim they're the victims of a laughably implausible global conspiracy, without any evidence. When they're fact checked, relevant research is cited, it isn't one person's *word* against another's, it's facts claimed against facts proved. Notice how there are no libel or slander cases being brought by any of the people liberally discredited in the press? If true they could sue for a fortune, and it would be easy to prove since it all rests on research. Why not? Funny that, isn't it?\n\nYou haven't been able to provide ANY EVIDENCE whatsoever for your claims. I CAN. I HAVE. All you have presented to me is a gut feeling that you're right, that's it. You won't even try to look for any evidence for your own peace of mind, it's bonkers.\n\nYou won't listen to me though, I'm well aware it's easier to fool a man than convince him he's been fooled. You just keep distrustring the people who've devoted their careers to looking after your health & welfare, and the institutions established specifically to protect you and who have highly effectively done so to date. Just keep waiting for your opportunity to say 'I told you so', any day now....",

I haven't followed their advice in isolation but in the context of clear scientific evidence. And it is. You can believe 'silenced' doctors who have variously been struck off or sued to prevent them from linking themselves to the institutions they worked for or qualified through, but I'm going to stick to peer reviewed consensus. There's no requirement for me to listen to any government, nor the opinion of a doctor who doesn't cite supporting data.\n\n>CBDC hasn\u2019t been in the open until very recently a lot more liberty than If they are introduced.\n\nThis is just nonesense. You won't find concerns like that discussed by serious financial institutions because it's manufactured fear mongering conspiracy bs. Yes there would be potential for abuse, but that *already exists* with the current system.\n\nIt's a total waste of energy getting excited over this stuff - get involved at community level if you want to have more agency over politics that affect you.

Survivorship bias precludes an accurate assessment. On balance probably yes, though it was poorly managed and executed. Apart from lives saved, inaction could have had worse economic impact.\n\nGone unchecked, the virus could have become more transmissible and more deadly; our health service (and other essential services) could have collapsed; a vaccine might not have been developed so quickly. \n\nThe way things transpired, it's easily seen as heavy handed, but at the time we didn't know what we know now. Also, permanent brain, heart and lung damage caused by covid is common, deaths aren't the only issue - the full impact is yet to become clear. Had the entire population been allowed to become infected, we could have become a nation riddled with longterm health issues, the impact of which would be enormous.\n\n>I\u2019m right to be wary of a state that has used this crisis to massively extend its power.\n\nOn this at least we do agree!\n\n>Where are all the bodies?\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=covid+cemeteries&client=ms-android-samsung-gs-rev1&tbm=isch&prmd=smivn&sxsrf=ALiCzsaBncuHll_pXIVRZ57X9Il88usZdw:1655908717145&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjPqPbWpMH4AhUwQkEAHS82DmkQ_AUoA3oECAIQAw&biw=412&bih=724&dpr=2.63",

I don't trust any politician, I trust my own experience and peer reviewed research. I also recognise how many unaffiliated sources report near identical data. Stick a pin in a map and type that village + covid into Google and you'll find those people have lived through a similar experience. Who would be capable of orchestrating such a thing when most in power can scarcely organise a fuck in a brothel.\n\n>chose to copy authoritarian China\n\nErm. Masks, social distancing and quarantine were implemented during the Spanish flu.\n\n>Do you know under cover of this \u201cpandemic \u201c the USA,the U.K. and the EU have expanded the money supply by 30 to 40%. The lockdowns served the purpose of keeping demand low and depressing the economy. Now things have opened up inflation is soaring and will end in the destruction of all fiat currencies.\n\nIt defies all logic that this global macro economic crisis would be caused deliberately. It's ironic that people who perceived disease mitigation to be necessary against covid were deemed to be living in fear, so we got jabbed and moved on with our lives, meanwhile you're still fretting about an all powerful bogeyman.\n\n>Then we will willingly accept the CBDCs they are preparing despite the destruction of liberty that they entail.\n\nLiberty? \ud83d\ude02 Oh boy.",

That can't come as news to you surely. Their behaviour was abysmal but I think it's normal to perceive less risk from people you know. I'd be surprised if there were many people who could say they never bent the rules once, even those who took it seriously.\n\n>So you admit it doesn\u2019t affect young people\n\nI just described several cases where it affected young people. Seldom deadly, but potentially seriously harmful. Go have a look at one of the long covid subs, where many talk about killing themselves to end the misery of chronic fatigue, pericarditis etc.\n\n>There was nothing out of the ordinary in the all cause mortality figures for 2020\n\nThere was. It's a complex measure, explained in depth here.\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid\n\n>The whole scam is built on the PCR test. Patrick Vallance is on record as saying it is useless to tell if someone is sick or infectious. Fauci is on record as saying it\u2019s useless once you go beyond 25/30 cycles. Mullis the inventor said it was possible to find anything in anyone using his test. Drosten who created the PCR test did using no genetic material but computer records sent from China. \n\nSo what? What do you think the problem is specifically? I've tested countless times, and the only time I tested positive out of 100+ tests, my had partner tested for work and came up positive first, no symptoms, then days later I tested positive too (lat flow then pcr) and was very sick. All prior and subsequent tests have been negative. Anecdotal evidence only of course, but in my experience, they're accurate. I've had another flu subsequently and tested negative then.\n\n>It makes a lot of sense to an authoritarian government.\n\nSpecifically how? What can a vaccine passport achieve that a regular passport (coupled with all the other ways we can already be monitored and controlled) cannot?\n\n>There was due to be a protest against the Chinese government and people found that their health passports had been turned to red so they were unable to travel.\n\nLol. I hate to break it to you but China have been doing as they please since well before covid.",

They are mirrored by what has happened everywhere else in the world, this information isn't only coming from a single source. The science didn't really change, we just learned more as time went on.\n\nWe've exchanged dozens of posts, and you've yet to make a single claim you can prove. Not one. \n\nQuestion: If this pandemic is fake, how would a real one look different? Do you think there would be people profiteering by claiming the virus was harmless, the vaccine unnecessary and selling unapproved drugs? Would they blame big pharma? Tell lies and claim they were being silenced? If so, how would you evaluate who was telling the truth?",

Nonesense, his message has reached you, hasn't it. Science runs on consensus and probability and he quite simply hasn't shown either. It's not complicated. \n\nWhat do you think peer review is?\n\nCovid data is being gathered and reported by unaffiliated parties all over the world. Were it being falsified, we'd see divergent numbers, but we aren't. AE's from the vaccine occur at a pretty uniform rate, as do covid infections and deaths. \n\nJust stop for a minute and consider the scale of this thing. There's no way to coordinate a conspiracy involving the global medical and legal fraternity, every single government and independent regulator, which is what would be required. Millions of people across multiple professions. \n\nCompetition between big pharma is fierce - you think J&J would let their vaccine get pulled and keep quiet knowing the others caused harm?

The conclusion of the study explains:\n\n>Systemic immune response after BNT162b2 vaccine is a reasonable cause for transient semen concentration and TMC decline. \n\nIn other words, the flu-like symptoms we experience from vaccination temporarily reduce semen concentration. It makes sense, little swimmers are very sensitive to temperature and a normal immune response to the vaccine includes a fever.\n\n>Long-term prognosis remains good.\n\nSo, in line with earlier studies no cause for concern concluded.\n\nhttps://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/covid-19-vaccination-does-not-reduce-chances-conception-study-suggests\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8489287/\n\nThe virus itself could affect long term  fertility though.\n\n>Reproductive organs\u00a0are sensitive to pathogenic insult, and hence might be targeted by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

I'm not denying there are some rare events, here and there, but to make it sound like 1 out of 2 people will have an issue, is absurd. \n\n5 years from now, covid will barely be a thing people talk/care about.

I have worked in the vaccine field (mycobacteria).\nI have concerns over the safety of the Covid vaccines, particularly the mRNA. In younger healthy populations I question whether the risk exceeds the benefit. Iam also against mandates or coercion. I have taken the Covid vaccine, Iam in my early 40s and excellent health and fitness. Despite all of this Iam called anti-vax. We need a place where there is the ability to have evidence based discussions. Yes there is some theories discussed here that are bullish!t but plenty of people step up to call them out.\n\nI got banned in a Canadian regional subredit for linking to the FDA advisory committee document (Pfizer for 12-15) and highlighting that in a scenario where a reduction in the prevelence or lethality of the virus would result in the risk of vaccination exceeding the benefit for boys. That scenario happened with Omicron. The ban reason was that I may discourage somebody from taking the vaccine.",

Wish you hadn't implied I am a fool, but it's otherwise a great comment.\n\nBut I want to be clear about my position. I do not call these \"clot shots\" or believe them to be \"population control\" or anything of the sort. I already knew that had a research history. I just think they were a poorly assessed, fear-based decision by politicians who need to appear to be \"doing something\" about a crisis.\n\nYes, mRNA shots have a long record of 30+ years of research, but it is a poor record in that it never before met a safety threshold acceptable for advancing through human trials to market. In 2020, though, we decided to push them through as an emergency treatment to fight a disease that is one of the least deadly diseases we vaccinate against. That is my problem: We are using the single most dangerous vaccine on the market (although it is admittedly not THAT dangerous, it has resulted in more side effects than all others combined) to combat one of the least deadly diseases for which we have a vaccine - especially to people under 70 or so. To me, that seems a poor risk assessment, especially when we try to make it mandatory for all. I simply differ from our politicians in my acceptance of health risk to the population; I do not believe mRNA shots have no role in public health, nor that they are a conspiracy of some sort. \n\nIn my ideal world, these shots would exist, would be recommended for everyone over about 60-70 years of age, would be approved for everyone down to about 20-30, and would be optional for all. But that is not the world we live in. Our real world panicked, threw out the level of risk we previously accepted, and it still tries to make everyone take the shots and shames those who assess risk a bit differently. Not great.",

I think your shiny little hat is too tight \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut anyway. Do you believe that corruption is either absolute or nonexistent? ie, could SOME content on one platform be compromised by greed but not other content? I think blanket writing off of a whole platform (excluding openly bias MSM) like this is silly. I don't think every single article is bollocks or has an agenda. However, I do think that when it comes to highly politicised topics, there is a huge vulnerability to being influenced, diluting the factual integrity and public trust. \n\nNo one platform ever only reports facts. None. The trick is being open enough to see the bullshit.",

Ivermectin is used to treat livestock for parasites and has been the subject of warnings by Health Canada, which said \u201cthere is no evidence that ivermectin works to prevent or treat COVID-19.\u201d\n\nA few things:\n\n1) I've never seen anyone call ivermectin a \"vaccine,\" and it's strange that the author originally calls it that but later calls it a \"treatment\"    \n2) When the author says \"anti-vaccine groups,\" is she referring to people who oppose all vaccines, people who oppose the covid vaccines, or people who oppose the mandates and lockdowns? These three groups are very different from one another, and the obfuscation frustrates me    \n3) Many *people* take ivermectin. It's on a list of essential medications, and two people won a Nobel prize using it to treat malaria. Calling it something that livestock take is pretty disingenuous    \n4) Is saying \"We have no evidence to believe that treatment X is effective\" the same as a \"warning\"? A warning, to me, is saying that you should not take something because it is dangerous. Additionally, it seems that a lot of evidence has come out supporting ivermectin's use in combating covid (like the midsection of Africa), and if Canada says there is no evidence, it seems more likely that they are simply burying their heads in the sand because they don't want to acknowledge safe alternatives.

Fine. The problem with this (apart from again, it being fallacious as hell) is:\n\n1. This would only work in a vacuum where everyone has gotten covid and nobody already had covid and recovered. As it stands, we have over 250m recoveries and under 5% of the planet's population has gotten covid in the two years it's been active. With the vaccine, you 100% get it, and you receive multiple doses (some countries are up to what, four jabs now?) so the risk profile is not presented honestly to begin with.\n\n2. Given that you can still get infected, spread and die of covid fully vaccinated, vaccination is an additional risk. It is dishonest and bad faith to present it as an either-or. \n\n3. It's also actually bad faith to even state this with certainty, as the data we have on covid and vaccine side effects are nowhere near equal in quality. Given the limitations of safety signal systems and VSD, we don't have anywhere near enough high quality data to measure this against covid studies.\n\n4. This take is also completely outdated because we don't have sufficient data on newer variants, which have shown to be milder as the disease mutates further along. Omicron for example is showing to be the mildest variant yet, so the \"risk outweighs the benefits\" argument needs to be revisited.\n\n>Can you quote where in the report they say the vaccine can cause harm in pregnancy the same level as covid can?\n\nLiteral strawman argument. \n\n>You do not need to keep projecting the fact that you linked that video but didn't watch it yourself. I really don't think you would have ever watched a video on how a debate works if you think it goes \"Step 1. announce your undefeated recorded\"\n\nReported again for ad homs.\n\nJust watch the video dude lol you're just making your position look less educated.",

Additionally even the data you do have in this study is further limited, which you failed to acknowledge:\n\n\"A limitation of our report is that the registry lacks information on gestational age at the time of early pregnancy registration, and thus we could not match case patients and controls according to gestational age. However, most recognized miscarriages are known to occur between pregnancy weeks 6 and 10,5\u00a0a period that is similar to the gestational ages at which women in Norway consult a physician to confirm pregnancy (Fig. S1). Also, only approximately 40% of women in Norway have a primary care appointment to confirm pregnancy, but the characteristics of these women appear to be similar to those of women who do not have a registered pregnancy confirmation (Table S4). We cannot address associations between vaccination and miscarriages that were not clinically recognized.\"\n\nThen, if this weren't bad enough, you tried to pivot it to an argument about stillbirths with covid completely, failing to realize that not only does that have nothing to do with your argument and is just a narrative push, but it also makes your first claim fall on its head completely because it proves that the harmful agent in question - the spike protein - can indeed cause harm in pregnancy. This same spike protein is used in vaccines and with mRNA ones, your own cells are programmed to make this. \n\nDude I'm serious please watch that video, I'm embarrassed for you.",

I'll parse this Citynews article too:\n\n> There have been rumours circulating the web about the rise of still-births in Waterloo Region. Now, officials from two local hospitals say this is incorrect.\n\nWhy only from two local hospitals? [This website says there are seven hospitals spread over ten campuses](https://www.wwhealthline.ca/listServices.aspx?id=10078). Why are the officials from only two hospitals making statements? I can see how maybe one or two hospitals do not have ObGyn departments - I don't know because I'm not from Waterloo. But that still leaves five or six hospitals. Why only two?\n\n> The Chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Cambridge Memorial Hospital said the misinformation is very concerning. Grand River Hospital also took to social media stating the spread of misinformation is \"dangerous and creates unnecessary anxiety and fear among expectant families.\"\n\nIrrelevant - does not address the data.\n\n> Taking to Twitter with a statement saying, \"there is no truth to these claims. Occurrences of still-births in Waterloo Region are tragic. Still, they remain steady at between two and four per cent, lower than the national average.\"\n\nAgain - over what period is that average? And why is it between 2 and 4%? I thought it was between 0.2 and 0.4%.\n\n> \"This year, we have had 982 deliveries in Cambridge and four still-births. That is a still-birth rate of 0.41 per cent, which is our average,\" said Kristin Wadsworth, Chief of Obstetrician and Gynecology at Cambridge Memorial Hospital.\n\nOK - specific to Cambridge. What about the other 6 hospitals? And here the stillbirth rate is 0.41%? (maybe there was a typo somewhere). But 0.41% is not between 0.2% and 0.4% - schoolchildren know this.\n\n> Dr. Peter Potts, Joint Chief of Staff at Grand River Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital  said the misleading information on twitter suggested 86 still-births occurred in the region. In reality 12 had occurred in the last fiscal year between both GRH and CMH. \n\n12 stillbirths occurring at two hospitals GRH and CMH does not **disprove** whether 86 stillbirths occurred in the whole region, which would include seven hospitals spread over ten campuses, and also home stillbirths.\n\n> Dr. Wadsworth stresses for expectant families to ask their medical provider questions if they have concerns. Still, it is the actual COVID-19 virus that is of concern and not the vaccines. \n\nIrrelevant - does not address the missing data.\n\n> According to Dr. Wadsworth, the hospital's still-birth rates have been the same year over year, but they have noticed some pregnant patients who come in with COVID have had to be shifted to the ICU and did have early deliveries.\n\nAgain, averaged over the whole year? We are specifically interested in a shorter time period - as stated, we are interested in 6 months. And which hospital is this? Notice it says \"hospital's\", meaning a single hospital. It does not say \"hospitals'\", which would be all the hospitals in the region. So, the \"misinformation\" claim as made is not being addressed\n\n> \"If you are pregnant and get COVID, you are more likely to end up in the hospital, end up in the ICU, and end up having a pre-term baby, which can lead to more problems.\"\n\nIrrelevant - does not address the data.\n\n> Dr. Potts said, \"we feel COVID vaccinations during pregnancy are a normal part  to prenatal care and the obstetricians and midwives in the community strongly support the vaccination during pregnancy.\n\nAgain, Dr. Potts making irrelevant statements.\n\n> \"There is a growing body of evidence that the vaccination is safe.\"\n\nIrrelevant.\n\n> Dr. Wadsworth added vaccinations are essential for everyone. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology,  the Centre for Disease Control and The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada has made a statement regarding the vaccine and its safety amongst pregnant individuals. \n\nAgain, irrelevant to the central question.\n\n> \"Vaccinations are important for everybody, and we know they are safe in pregnancy. We want to protect our patients as much as possible, and it is okay to ask questions. It is important to ask the medical provider, what the evidence is, what the recommendation is and not to look at social media. We are always happy to answer patient questions,\" she said.\n\nContinuing irrelevancy.\n\n**Summary**\n\nCitynews article parsing completed. Incomplete and nontransparent statements which do not bolster the public's trust.\n\nHow did I do? This is so easy it is getting a bit tedious.",

Officials said while always tragic, the occurrence of stillbirths remains between .2 and .4 per cent in Waterloo region, which is lower than the national average.\n\nTime-averaged over what period? Is the average for 2021? Or the average for the last two weeks? Hell, it could be the average over the last decade. They don't say.\n\n> \"That information really just doesn't sit well with us and it doesn't sit well with the statistics that we've been able to pull out. Our stillbirth statistics compare very favourably or much lower than that,\" Dr. Peter Potts Joint Chief of Staff for Grand River Hospital and St. Mary\u2019s General Hospital told CTV News.\n\nWho cares *how* it \"sits\" with you. Give actual data, rather than present your delicate feelings!\n\n> The hospital said spreading this misinformation is dangerous and creates unnecessary anxiety among expectant families.\n\nAnother zero data statement.\n\n> \"We\u2019re quite confident that these statistics are erroneous and putting a lot of fear in women around the risk of stillbirth, it just isn't warranted,\" Dr. Potts said.\n\nWell, Dr. Potts, show the actual data. How many still births every day for the last 6 months? I don't care about your confidence - I care about the public's confidence, and that depends on you being absolutely transparent *with the data*!\n\n> University of Guelph Psychology professor Patrick Barclay said people have become less trusting of medical professionals and the government because the pandemic has gone on so long. He feels gaining that trust back will take time.\n\nVery true statement. Gain the trust back by presenting with actual data.\n\n> \"The more transparent the communications, the more that it expresses the uncertainty. 'Here's what we know. Here's what we don't know.' Then, the more that people trust that, because they can see that they're being dealt with honestly,\" Barclay said.\n\nGreat idea! So be transparent, by giving us the actual data, otherwise this is another zero data statement\n\n> Experts say often misinformation is not spread maliciously, but is the result of someone trying to help their friends and family. Especially if the current government rules don\u2019t mesh with their lifestyle.\n\nMay or may not be true. I don't care either way. This does not speak to the number of stillbirths recently. It might be intended to distract from the real question - the number of stillbirths.\n\n> \"The information being packaged by public health, for example, doesn't have the same kind of narrative appeal as certain kinds of misinformation and disinformation,\" Penelope Ironstone, an Associate Professor with Wilfrid Laurier University's Department of Communications said.\n\nAgain, irrelevant to the real question - the number of stillbirths.\n\n> Ironstone added that dislodging misinformation is a challenge that sometimes has the opposite effect.\n\nAgain, irrelevant.\n\n> \"Misinformation spreads much more quickly, goes further and lasts a lot longer than a lot of people think,\" Ironstone said.\n\nAgain, irrelevant.\n\n> With so much information available online, Ironstone feels there needs to be some type of surveillance.\n\nYes - surveillance of the number of stillbirths. I think everyone can agree to that. Are you maybe not doing that, therefore you don't know the number of stillbirths? Well, get cracking.\n\n> \"Tracing and tracking and trying to figure out when certain bits of misinformation take hold,\" Ironstone said.\n\nAgain, irrelevant.\n\n> Dr. Potts said pregnant women that contract COVID-19 are more likely to have a stillbirth.\n\nA small amount of data. Good - so continue in this vein - how many stillbirths were there, how many mothers had COVID, how many were vaccinated? Surely you have this data.\n\n> \"We think vaccination in pregnancy is the way to go and in fact that will reduce the stillbirth rate, which is exactly opposite to these erroneous statistics are suggesting,\" Potts said.\n\nYour \"thoughts\" are irrelevant. Give actual data on actual stillbirths.\n\n> Dr. Potts said anyone with questions should speak with their health care provider, to ensure information comes from reputable sources.\n\nA true statement, but irrelevant to the real question - the number of stillbirths. Does my health care provider have the answer to the key question?\n\n**Summary**\n\nThey are circumnavigating the central question, and making statements that would be considered true in a court of law. That court of law may be Nuremberg 2.0, and they know it. On advice of their lawyers, they are refraining from lying.\n\nYou want the public's trust? Answer the question with a concrete statement like \"the average number of stillbirths per week at Grand River Hospital and St. Mary\u2019s General Hospital averaged G and S, respectively, in calendar year 2021. The minimum number per week were R and M, respectively and the maximum number per week were M and N, respectively.\" That would gain my trust. Carefully avoiding the central question is exactly the reason why I don't trust them, and it is exactly the reason why I actually believe there were likely 86 stillbirths in 6 months.",

(stmt Y)\n\nIs it weird that the article mentions \"the last fiscal year\"? What does a \"fiscal year\" have to do with this? It is a medical question, not a finance question. \"fiscal year\" raises an instant red flag with me!\n\nIt appears from [these Cambridge Memorial Hospital expense reports](https://www.cmh.org/accountability/financials/executive-expense-postings), that \"the last fiscal year\" is from April 1 2020 to March 31 2021. (The documents list each quarter and lists the dates). \n\nSo, if the typical stillbirth rate is 1 stillbirth every two months spread over all [7 hospitals in the Waterloo Region](https://www.wwhealthline.ca/listServices.aspx?id=10078), that would suggest maybe 1 per hospital per year. So, in fiscal year 2020/2021, the two hospitals GRH and CMH would be expected to have 2 stillbirths from April 1 2020 to March 31 2021. The article stating that 12 stillbirths happened from April 1 2020 to March 31 2021 is a big increase from the expected 2 stillbirths. It is mathematically possible (and consistent with the two statements X and Y being true) that there were 1-2 stillbirths from April 1 2020 to Dec 31 2020, and 10-11 stillbirths from January 1 2021 to April 1 2021 (totalling 12). If that increase is sustained, there would be another 14-15 still births in these two hospitals for the remainder of the \"January to July\" 7 month time mentioned by MPP Rick Nichols. That means a total of 24-26 stillbirths in these two hospitals. There are 7 hospitals in the Waterloo Region, but let's assume (anyone please check this) that 2 of them do not have Ob&Gyn facilities. Arithmetic tells us that 24-26 x (5/2) = 60-65, so a simple extrapolation of the GRH and CMH results gives an estimate of 60-65 stillbirths, **assuming a constant rate**. It probably wasn't constant, since vaccination rates meant that the population of vaxed mothers was increasing. You would not need much of an increase because of increased vaccination to get to 86 stillbirths. The extrapolation, based on statements X and Y both being true, squares with MPP Rick Nichols' statement.\n\nI predict that statement Y \n\n> In reality 12 had occurred in the last fiscal year between both GRH and CMH.\n\nwill be removed from the [article](https://kitchener.citynews.ca/local-news/stillbirth-rates-not-increasing-in-the-region-according-to-hospital-officials-4804658). [Archived here](https://archive.vn/dRKjH). if it is, that is almost proof I am directly over the target. The CMH expense reports are also a target for deletion, hence proof of my accurate targeting.\n\nLet's watch.",

I don't give a damn what the FDA has to say about anything.  Every government and their health authority in the world (except the Taliban) is in favor of vaccination.  So when I look at countries that have their shit together and see that they are recommending vaccination, that is enough for me to trust it.  I trust the Nordic countries especially, as their citizens are consistently rated as having the highest quality of life and they take a pragmatic approach to most issues.",

And it's a complete and utter strawman argument. Every single medical intervention has possible side effects. You can pick up a bottle of Tylenol and read about the possible side effects right on the bottle. I'm sorry you feel misinformed, but perhaps you should take some responsibility for that. \n\nIn any case, I'd just point out that many vaccines can cause the symptoms you describe in very rare circumstances.

There is MUCH more money to be made from plant agriculture, the oil based pesticides and the manufacturing of 'food-like products'\n\nIf meat is so bad then explain to me how until Nov of 2021 there was zero studies on people who are majority carnivores? because the powers that be who control the research grants understand whats up and they want people to be soft, docile, weak, and consuming - that is why they keep funding studies which will draw the conclusions they want.... but then again I know you don't understand this because of your two replies to me. \n\n[That one study](https://academic.oup.com/cdn/article/5/12/nzab133/6415894) looking at carnivores (which turned out overwhelmingly positive) HAD to be crowd funded... Why do you think that is? \n\nNow I do agree that most factory farming is unethical - not all of it, and I do my very best to buy from local farms however yeah however doing the right things isn't cheap... I am sorry it isn't as simple as making some virtue signaling social media posts where everyone will circle-jerk eachother about how good they are and how bad everyone else is.  \n\nI don't believe buying pre-packaged processed foods and GMO produce is that ethical because it is done by mega multi-national corporations...

I am sure cognitive dissidence has already kicked in for you and I am talking to a wall because the world is a scary place and it DOES NOT care about you.

            "body": "Sorry dude you have to learn about how fucked up this world is the hard way, this isn't even the first time something like this has happened in history although the scale is certainly the largest (AIDS in the 80s).... you may have gotten off easy however assuming it doesn't get worse and there is a reason why it may... I say easy because Autoimmune stuff can sometimes be managed and possibly cured on a long enough timeline if you have the patience to pay attention to your body and adjust accordingly although I won't be able to give you a full roadmap on what to do since everyone is different. \n\nI believe I was injured from the Guardisil shots several years ago but I didn't even know what it may have been from until careful retrospection years later when started digging into all of this stuff.  An autoimmune condition like you have is your bodies immune system given the wrong set of marching orders, so when the 'stress' conditions are met your body starts attacking the wrong thing, first you have to figure out a set of conditions as to where your body will stop attacking itself and then you have to avoid those conditions for a long long time for your body to reset those instructions (it may even be life as the door has been opened however given enough time it won't return immediately). Unfortunately you will be hard-pressed to find find practicing physicians to have a full understanding of this and won't simply prescribe immune-supressing biologic meds like enbrel which suppress your bodies immune system and eventually will make your health worse... Most doctors aren't smart enough to make the associations necessary to understand the path to healing because the path to becoming a practicing physician requires them keep their thinking in a ridged box for many reasons including liability and because they have a medical board to answer to.... \n\nAs i think of this there are all more reasons onto why the world sucks. The good news is your young enough and your asking the right questions so I think eventually you will be able to figure out some of the things I can't properly articulate right now assuming of course you don't decide to put your head in the sand and try to ignore the world around like so many do... That is starting to get into psychology.\n\nUnderstand that if you have what I think would be called 'psoriasis' doesn't mean your issues are limited to that box of issues, it is just for whatever reason your skin was the 'path of least resistance' - given enough stress with new injury or time without healing the old damage, it will progress, to other areas of your body, to your joints, to your digestive tract, to nerves, to other organs, and even your brain given the right set conditions - the door has been opened.  \n\nHow I went about trying to treat this was by diet although I haven't yet found a cure, I have not found enough relief as to constitute being 'cured' however it is in remission enough to the point where I can see it coming back if I start consuming the wrong foods and make adjustments.... Your body doesn't understand that a synthetic shot caused your issues, it only understands the make-up of what you ate at the time and that thing will now act as the trigger... This happens all the time in people with wheat, legumes (beans), nightshades (tomatoes) and there are a few others. Sometimes if you always consumed them together like tomatoes and garlic, Tomatoes may be your real problem but garlic alone can cause the same problems to a lesser degree because they were both in your digestive tract at the same time... these are just examples... \n\nYou hope that maybe this will go away on its own or go away faster than me who only started this journey when I was 30 but chances are you will have to do an elimination diet and closely monitor yourself which means eating out will be very difficult until you understand exactly what triggers you. The simplest elimination diet is to start with a few weeks of only eating meat and then adding back one thing at a time a week or two at a time until you find what it could be, there is also something called FODMAP which are a list of foods which commonly trigger people.... as I said before I don't have the perfect roadmap for YOU to reclaim your health - nobody will. You have to become your own scientist. I should also mention because i just thought of it that things like psoriasis can be inflamed by things aren't limited to things you put into your body but also what goes onto your skin (soaps, detergents on cloths, deodorants, cleaning agents, certain types of fabric like polyesters and I am sure there are aspects I am not thinking about right at this moments... \n\nGoogle is your friend, and don't limit your search to just google (bing, yandex, qwant) or just these vaccines being the root cause in order to find the right answer.... it will eventually be a unique solution. \n\nThen there is the thought that you may need a metal detox... this is something I am less familiar with because it didn't seem to be my issue however that is a direction to also think about.... I can see other people are giving you good advice onto where to look to don't just listen to me because I may not be exactly right and this is where it will be key for you to learn as you go on into life... Don't take any piece of advice as a 'panacea' for whatever issue you may have... this is what got us into this mess. Your strongest asset will have to be to being able to consider ideas without putting too much weight into any of them... this is a skill that few people have, it has to do with human psychology and the shitty way that schools teach people how to 'learn' or should I say how to follow instruction and regurgitate answers... The people who did poorly in school because they were uninterested and not simply 'low-intelligence' are usually the best at this. \n\nI feel like I could have taken this in another direction like learn how to be skeptical without being cynical, or my other piece of advice is read the bible to get an understanding of how \"this could have happened\" as there is nothing new under the sun in terms of human behavior so you understand how not to be taken advantage of again. but I have already spent an hour on this and I am losing steam and most people would think I am crazy so I could have lost you after the 3rd paragraph. \n\nGood luck and stay hard.",

But it\u2019s the ones who are ostracized, the ones losing their jobs who see this corruption. \n\nA good doctor will discuss lifestyle changes , diet , sleep etc instead of jumping to prescriptions and whoever told this young person that they needed the vaccine was a fucking wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing, who now will be benefitted by pharma and the whole system will continue with these lifelong chronically ill patients that have been created.",

And here we have the entire planet taking them and it\u2019s been 1.5 years\u2026..and nothing. That\u2019s just basic statistics.

I am grateful that my family members and coworkers and general acquaintances have as well And I have been lucky enough that the COVID  Pandemic has not affected me outside of normal life, other than becoming a huge Instacart fan And having to watch more new movies streaming at home instead of the theater. \n\nMy grandmother was very involved with naturopath practices and used to be an acupuncturist back in her home country, So I have definitely drank my fair share of herbal brewed concoctions and consumed less Tylenol than your average American. She had a General MD that she saw regularly but always preferred alternative medicine when she didn\u2019t require surgery or prescriptions from the doctor. And she made it to 101, a true dinosaur \ud83e\udd95 \n\nGlad you are feeling better and I wish you continued good health.",

Even the Biden admin and CDC started admitting this, because they realized the inflating death toll made them look bad. \n\nThird, the case numbers themselves aren\u2019t even accurate as not only are they underreported, the PCR tests are wildly inaccurate. \n\nFourth, the efficacy of the vaccines themselves is unimpressive to say the least, offering limited and temporary protection while having much worse side effects than any other vaccine I\u2019ve ever taken. \n\nMost importantly, it\u2019s absurd to use these statistics in a way that implies everyone has a similar risk profile. While the average age of a covid death is older than the average life expectancy and the average covid death has 4 co-morbidities. This virus poses virtually zero risk to a 17 year old healthy girl, and its reprehensible that she was coerced into taking it and then suffered health complications. The argument that her getting it protects other more vulnerable people doesn\u2019t even hold water anymore because these \u201cvaccines\u201d do nothing to stop the spread.

This might involve everything form supporting the liver to removing foods that are slightly allergenic to supporting your immune system to opening up detoxification through the gut and kidneys, etc.\n\nHealing is possible, it's just not mainstream.\n\nBut I would go so far as to say it is good that you had this, so you can learn about it. It is the truth, and we need people who are aware and can change the lives of those around them by being aware.\n\nSo don't be stuck int he victim seat. You don't like the visible look on your legs; be glad you have legs. Could be worse. Find something you can do about it.\n\nI would read Robert O Young's work on vaccines. Only because it's too excessive, too wild. But you need to swallow that pill, understand that side of the pool. I would see an acupuncturist, visit someone who works with chronically ill patients (ie serious cancers) not someone doing acupuncture for relaxation and mindfulness hubbub. Get their take. Learn all these different sides of the pool. See what works for you. See a diet specialist. Maybe a naturopath--they are hit or miss, can be expensive. There's a project, [freefirsttest.com](https://freefirsttest.com), that offers the style of work I do in an online setting with a free first test, done in a yoshiaki omura like capacity (another great one to study). finally, i would study as much of dietrich klinghardt's work on recovery from vaccinations as you can. the man is a legend, truly has done great work. But, offers expensive protocols so it helps to have a guide and a translator for his protocols (why buy a $100 bottle of a tincture if you can make a years supply for half as much). His work is called autonomic response testing.\n\nGood luck.",

Their ideas need to be proven\n\nIt is up to the reader to decide how plausible their arguments are - could some of their ideas never pan out in reality? Of course. Biology is complicated and often unpredictable.  I think their ideas could really give *pause* to those open enough to their ideas - oh  shoot, what could these vaccines possibly do? And take it from there. We simply don't have the data to answer/investigate the points they raise. It doesn't mean the authors are lying, or reaching to the point of obscurity/dishonesty - in an open and fair system, they would be taken seriously and these products would be investigated further\n\nI agree with you OP. The paper should not be used as scientific \"proof\" of the ideas they convey. This post is a refreshing exercise in integrity and I appreciate that",

In some cases, they link to other vaccines, old mRNA technology, or COVID-19 infection, but are not directly linked to mRNA vaccines.\n\nIn fact, so much of their evidence is from papers on severe COVID-19 infections, not vaccination, much content in this article might be better suited to a paper pointing out potential downstream dangers of severe COVID infections rather than raising alarm about mRNA vaccination.\n\nA number of places in the article seem to make stronger statements linking mRNA vaccines to some of these processes, but they self-cite a previous review article by senior author McCullough and do not reference any primary biological research making these connections.\n\nThey suggest connections of these mechanisms to various anecdotal case reports for herpes zoster reactivation, liver damage, optic neuropathy, T cell lymphoma progression, Hepatitis C reactivation, events not yet confirmed to be related to mRNA vaccination.\n\nThe paper amounts to laying out a series of hypotheses about mechanisms of harm that may come from mRNA vaccines.  Hypothesis generation is a valuable exercise, including in this context of understanding downstream biological effects of vaccination that might induce harm.\n\nHowever, not all hypotheses are equally justified.  Some are well-girded in direct evidence from relevant studies, while others are more speculative and extrapolate principles from other settings, e.g. SARS-CoV-2 infections or other injected vaccines, as done here.\n\nIndeed the speculative nature of their exploration is implicitly acknowledged by the authors in their choice of wording throughout, including \u201cis plausible\u201d,\u201cone can speculate\u201d,\u201cmight be a mechanism\u201d,\u201cone can hypothesize\u201d,\u201cit appears\u201d, \u201cwe expect\u201d, \u201ccould eventually lead to\u201d, etc.\n\nIt seems that rather than \u201cestablish a mechanistic framework\u201d, this paper simply lays out speculative mechanistic hypotheses with little direct connection to mRNA vaccines.  Hypotheses to validate, not principles to assume true unless disproven, as their conclusion implies.\n\n\"*We call on the public health institutions to demonstrate, with evidence, why the issues discussed in this paper are not relevant to public health, or to acknowledge that they are and to act accordingly.*\"\n\nTheir conclusion uses the classic \u201cshifting the burden\u201d trick, presuming that it is the responsibility of the scientific community to disprove their hypotheses rather than their responsibility to prove it.   This tactic has been common in the pandemic.\n\nThe entire last part of the paper presents results from VAERs attempting to \u201cstrengthen\u201d a causal link between mRNA vaccinations and broad classes of pathologies, including nerve inflammation, heart disorders, liver disease, thrombosis, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.\n\nTheir case for causation is driven by their claim that the mechanisms discussed in this paper represent \u201ccausal pathways\u201d, the fact that most VAERs reports occur soon after infection, and that the vast majority of VAERs reports in 2021 are from COVID, not other vaccines.\n\n\"*In mining VAERS for \u2018signals\u2019 that might indicate adverse reactions (AEs) to mRNA vaccinations, we acknowledge that no report to VAERS establishes a causal link with the vaccination. That said, the possibility of a causal relationship is strengthened through both the causal pathways we have described in this paper, and the strong temporal association between injections and reported AEs. Nearly 60% of all mRNA-injection-related -AEs have happened within 48 h of injection.*\"\n\nThis follows a line of argument used by others that the only possible explanation for higher VAERs reports close to time of injection is vaccine causation, ignoring that events immediately following injection are more likely to be considered vaccine related and thus reported.\n\nThey step through their chosen symptom categories and list what % of VAERs reports in 2021 were for COVID rather than other vaccines, supposing that high % indicates that event is \u201cespecially significant as a potential toxic effect of these vaccines\u201d\n\n\"*We decided that a reasonable way to characterize the significance of adverse events linked to COVID-19 vaccines was to focus on events received in the year 2021, and to compare the counts in the \u201cSYMPTOM\u201d field for the events associated with COVID-19 vaccines to the total counts for that same symptom for all vaccines over that same year.*\"\n\nOf course, this approach assumes that event reporting rates in 2021 do not vary across vaccine type, i.e. that COVID vaccines are not more likely to be reported to VAERs than flu or other vaccines, a highly dubious assumption.\n\nHere, from various negative control events looked up in VAERs, we can see that indeed reporting is higher for COVID than other vaccines across the board, unless you believe that vaccines cause toothaches, urinary incontinence, Xrays of limbs, or baldness.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n32vg6nyqgw81.jpg?width=1171&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0989f6ad1b7f5af7fb269c48213c180ae686922\n\nResults from several symptom categories demonstrates how their conclusions tend to overreach and ignore important confounding effects.\n\nHere are nerve inflammation symptoms they analyzed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/le5sm0d0rgw81.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=839c0d48d5a2dae5efb59c7af29f9dc5ce13d46f\n\nOne nerve inflammation symptom is anosmia.  They claim this \u201cclearly demonstrates\u201d the spike injected into arm reached the olfactory nerve, ignoring that anosmia is common with COVID-19 but not linked to vaccine, and could be caused by previous COVID-19 infection, not vaccine.\n\n...There were 3,657 cases of anosmia (loss of smell), clearly demonstrating that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein from the injection in the arm was reaching the olfactory nerve...\n\nHere are neurodegenerative disease symptoms they analyzed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g6y4bi71rgw81.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=265aff5675a21285046e17466cc362943279b435\n\nIn presenting neurodegenerative diseases, they acknowledge that they take decades to develop, yet imply some sort of connection with COVID-19 vaccines rather than considering the higher numbers for COVID-19 vaccines might be from higher reporting rates for COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\"*Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are diseases that normally take decades to develop, and ordinarily one would assume that a vaccine has nothing to do with it. While the numbers are small, most of the cases in VAERS were linked to COVID-19 vaccines.*\"\n\nThey conclude by suggesting these VAERs results reflect increased cancer risk from mRNA vaccination, citing their mechanistic hypotheses, in spite of the fact that cancer takes years to form, even after exposure to fallout from a nuclear weapon like in Hiroshima.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fgdvpal2rgw81.png?width=505&format=png&auto=webp&s=08d77c613990d01e0738302e84cf773ae54fb7e0\n\n\"*Cancer is a disease generally understood to take months or, more commonly, years to progress from an initial malignant transformation in a cell to development of a clinically recognized condition.*\"\n\n\"*However, as we have outlined in our paper, if the mRNA vaccinations are leading to widespread dysregulation of oncogene controls, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis, then VAERS reports should reflect an increase in reports of cancer, relative to the other vaccines, even if the numbers are small. The experiment demonstrating impairment of DNA repair mechanisms by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in an in vitro study provides compelling evidence that the vaccines could accelerate the rate of DNA mutations, increasing cancer risk (Jiang and Mei, 2021).*\"\n\nTheir suggestions that they have evidence that mRNA vaccines increase cancer risk and that their literature review in this paper indicate mechanisms of action further demonstrate the overreaching nature of the claims made in this paper.\n\nScientists have detected, validated, and characterized various minority harm risks of vaccines, including anaphylaxis/myocarditis for mRNA vaccines, and VITT/GBS for viral vectors.  Detection, validation, and characterization of any other risk is critically important.\n\nAnd deep characterization of the subgroups at highest risk of these serious complications, and of the severity and long-term effects of them needs to be highly prioritized research and considered in refining vaccination recommendations.\n\nStudies like this one integrating information from existing literature to posit hypotheses explaining these harms and others can be potentially useful.\n\nHowever the purported \u201cmechanistic frameworks\u201d laid out in this paper lack documented connections to mRNA vaccines, instead linking them to other vaccines, old mRNA technologies, or COVID-19 infections and speculating connections to mRNA vaccines.\n\nAdditionally, their case for vaccine relatedness is built upon flawed VAERs analyses that link higher reporting rates with significance as potential toxic vaccine effect, ignoring that events COVID-19 vaccination might be reported more often, as strongly suggested by the data.\n\nBottom line is that unless these assertions are validated, they should be acknowledged as hypotheses to investigate, not principles that should be assumed true unless disproven.  I have a feeling that is not how this paper will be represented and promoted on social media.\n\nStudies integrating information from existing literature to posit hypotheses explaining these harms and others are potentially useful, which this paper purports to do.\n\nHowever, the \u201cmechanistic frameworks\u201d laid out in this paper lack documented connections to mRNA vaccines, instead linking them to other vaccines, old mRNA technologies, or COVID-19 infections.  This makes their hypotheses speculative at best.\n\nThe bottom line is that this paper is comprised of a number of speculative hypothesis that can be viewed as unsubstantiated assertions.\n\nCertainly any paper proposing hypotheses needs to acknowledge they need to be investigated and validated, not assumed true unless disproven as the conclusion of this paper seems to imply.\n\nThis is especially true when the proposed hypotheses are as weakly supported as they are in this paper.\n\nThis is not how this paper will be represented, but the \"shifting the burden of evidence\" tactic will be used to oversell the evidence for its claims and try to suggest they have demonstrated biological principles and established risks that they clearly have not."

What makes you feel the vaccine is so necessary, when you\u2019d have a 98% chance of survival at worst? \nWhat makes you so ready to happily believe this article, even though it\u2019s more obvious thinly-veiled propaganda?\nWhy even debate menstrual issues, when the vaccine doesn\u2019t work at all? \n\nSpare me with the reduction of symptoms. The intention of the vaccine, *like all others*, was disease prevention. Check out any article a year old from when they launched. Furthermore, the EUA was issued under the guise of disease prevention, specifically. I\u2019d argue that, given the vaccines failure to do that, the EUA should be pulled. This is to say nothing of treatments being buried and demonized as horse paste, which is further dirty pool to get their EUA pushed through in the first place. \n\nNow we have tens of billions of shots at the ready, and they are known to be ineffective at best.

Based on what ive seen my null hypothesis is theres a lot of exaggeration of negative outcomes because people tend to do that. More people seem to think the vaccines are perfect due to propaganda of course but i see what i think is exaggeration on both sides\nOf this.\n\nMost people seem totally unfazed by covid and the vaccine. I agree with you that anecdotes vary but just take famous people for example. Either they are faking it or the vast majority got vaccinated\u2026 so if you believe theyre in on a secret and not getting vaxxed then i certainly cant prove otherwise\u2026 but if not, they mostly got vaxxed and not many bad adverse events so it seems. Not none and for sure many would hide if possible (gavin newsome getting bells palsie perhaps?). \n\nBut looking at a population like that, who are generally on the healthier side, and not seeing them drop dead alleviates some of the your anecdotes are different than mine concern, since we can all see info about famous people.",

She came up with what she felt was  conservative estimate of one unique instance of a \u201cside effect of special interest\u201d for every 1,900 vax doses. That category of side effects were usually fairly severe or serious, not just arm soreness, mild fever, etc. she was also appropriately conservative in counting the number of *unique* cases, meaning if someone had 3 different side effects, it would only count as one unique instance.\n\n1:1900 may seem like pretty good odds, and certainly explains the variability in people knowing or not knowing others who\u2019ve been affected, but 1:1900 is a staggering number for a mass-administered vaccine. \n\nTaking 1:1900 as correct (I think it\u2019s likely low, given the short time frame covered by the study in question) OWID says 64.2% of the world population has been vaxxed. Google says pop is 7.9 BB. Doing the math, ~27 million people will have had serious side effects. \n\nWe don\u2019t know how many people have suffered long-term problems from COVID infection, but 6.1 MM have died. Undoubtedly a goodly multiple of that have long-term negative effects. But the fact that potential vaccine injury is even in the same order of magnitude as injury from the illness is insane and totally unprecedented.\n\n(BTW, Kim Iversen is very worth watching. I think she\u2019s right of center, but she does actual journalism, shows her sources and AFAICT really tries to present facts and truth rather than spin and talking points. The Internet needs 50 more like her, on both sides of the divide \ud83d\udc4d)",

            "body": "> IF vaccines are...lets say the opposite of safe, how come the majority of vaxxed people are not dead\n\nThis is a valid question and I think is illustrative of how modern medicine operates. You first have to realize that a lot of government health policy is focused on the entire population and not individual people. So if they screen for diabetes, they are only going to find a few people out of hundreds of people that they test. Another example might be IV drug users catching HIV from a dirty needle, not every needle is contaminated, it's more about what happens across thousands of people.\n\nSo when talking about any drug (including vaccines), what does it really mean to be \"safe\"? If one out of every million people dies, is that safe? Like there is no doubt in anyones mind that the drug caused the death, but the circumstances were so rare that only one in a million will die, then whats the appropriate label for the drug? What if 50 out of 100 people die, does that mean that the drug wasn't safe for the 50 people that survived?\n\nSo when vaccines are being discussed, they reference safety on the basis of a population. It's safe for the population, but it can still be deadly for specific individuals. \n\nIn a perfect world they would screen people for certain factors that lead to death after taking a particular drug or vaccine. However screening costs money and if you add up these costs, then the vaccines no longer are worth the expense. For vaccines to be the choice, they have to be the cheapest method of treating disease. Otherwise if given the choice between an expensive vaccine or a cheap treatment, they will go with the cheaper alternative.\n\nSo at the end of the day, the medical system can't make safety decisions for individuals, only for the population. Each individual therefore must assume responsibility for their own individual safety.",

I hope the dupe is ok by the rules, LMK if it isn\u2019t (I\u2019m not highly experienced in Reddit or it\u2019s rules\u2026)\n\nKim Iversen did a good analysis of the possible risk ratio on The Hill\u2019s Rising show, based on a released Pfizer doc everyone is talking about: https://youtu.be/T0L360W5bc0\n\nShe was upfront that it was a bit of a SWAG, but she looked at the vax rates from Your World In Data to come up with an approximate number of vaxxed in the time frame of the report. She came up with what she felt was  conservative estimate of one unique instance of a \u201cside effect of special interest\u201d for every 1,900 vax doses. That category of side effects were usually fairly severe or serious, not just arm soreness, mild fever, etc. she was also appropriately conservative in counting the number of *unique* cases, meaning if someone had 3 different side effects, it would only count as one unique instance.\n\n1:1900 may seem like pretty good odds, and certainly explains the variability in people knowing or not knowing others who\u2019ve been affected, but 1:1900 is a staggering number for a mass-administered vaccine. \n\nTaking 1:1900 as correct (I think it\u2019s likely low, given the short time frame covered by the study in question) OWID says 64.2% of the world population has been vaxxed. Google says pop is 7.9 BB. Doing the math, ~27 million people will have had serious side effects. \n\nWe don\u2019t know how many people have suffered long-term problems from COVID infection, but 6.1 MM have died. Undoubtedly a goodly multiple of that have long-term negative effects. But the fact that potential vaccine injury is even in the same order of magnitude as injury from the illness is insane and totally unprecedented.\n\n(BTW, Kim Iversen is very worth watching. I think she\u2019s right of center, but she does actual journalism, shows her sources and AFAICT really tries to present facts and truth rather than spin and talking points. The Internet needs 50 more like her, on both sides of the divide \ud83d\udc4d",

Through smaller blood clots which can go undetected for a long time until they travel to the heart or any other organ where they become deadly - most people who will die from the vaccine, it will be because of that.\n\n5. A few years plus through vaccine induced AIDS that will slowly destroy the recipient's immune system and leave them vulnerable to all other infections. That remains to be seen.\n\nThe wild card is when the vaccine does the opposite than it is supposed to do, when catching the virus in the wild, and it kills you. That will happen whenever you catch the virus, and it might not be so rare.\n\nIn any case, I believe plenty of people received placebos without knowing it, instead of the real vaccine.",

We should look at the \"trend\" of data from the large amount of people educated in this field. There are always going to be a certain amount of dunces in every field, but it doesn't mean we have to throw out everything because of them. In this case, we have the entire worlds scientific organizations scientists focused on Covid and vaccination. \n\nIf there's a subject that takes years of studying to achieve knowledge on then what option do you have? \n\n>And, since I have access to the same knowledge as anyone else, for the most part these days due to the internet, I see no reason to consign all of my critical thinking abilities over to someone else. That is irresponsible in the highest degree.\n\nIf you're saying you have all the knowledge you need of virology, mrna and everything related to this vaccine via the internet, then I don't know what to tell you. The actual knowledge is something you need to be educated on for a long time. You can't just get a job into this field because you have access to the internet, that's ridiculous. \n\n>With that said, I have no issues with other people doing this. I am able to comprehend the things I read, not everyone can do that, and if you can't, then sure, just leave it up so someone smarter than yourself. That's not me, though.\n\nFirstly, I feel like your objection to the vaccine may be based on what other people are telling you to think, and not on your own incentive of actual educated analysis of data. Secondly, What I'm saying is that the vast majority of people educated in this field probably know a lot more than you. So I would take their word any day over yours. I'm not self centered enough to believe that I know better that world wide science in this field. Think of something you have talent and experience in, and then think about someone that has no experience in that field saying they know as much as you because they have the internet? They are pretty dumb, right? In your field, if some government organization tried to pull some stunt where they mislead the entire worlds people on something, then wouldn't you reach out to the internet? Wouldn't there be a massive uprising of people in your field saying it's bullshit?",

There are credentialed doctors on both sides of the equation\n\nHonestly, one of my biggest points ever is that we should leave this to the scientists educated in this field. I think the argument this subreddit is centered around should be contained to this idea -- are the majority of scientists educated on this topic pro vax or anti vax. We shouldn't be trying to interpret random statistics that we are not educated on. We should try to identify what percentage of people educated in this field would be pro covid vax vs anti covid vax. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>you can run parallel studies for sure, but they're not the same as consecutive studies.\n\nHaving said the above, I will answer you question here. No, the trials that were done met the criteria. Science has to meet criteria. Releasing a vaccine has to meet criteria. The point is, money can fast track the process. The idea that many things are conducted slowly because of resources is not an idea out of this realm. It's not an idea outside of this realm that the normal process could be fast tracked with world wide cooperation.  \n\nIt took like a year to approve the first vaccine for use. How long do you think it should have taken?\n\nThere are a ton of sources that explain how it occurred faster (including the one I posted). If you have a problem with what they are explaining then point out what they have done wrong. What you are suggesting is that world wide science that are educated in this field not only don't have any ethics whatsoever, but they are vaccinated themselves and their families anyway?",

Because it is effective. 99.99% of the hospitalizations from covid are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals. That's nation-wide. The lowest reported percentage is Arizona with 94.1%. The news wants to communicate this because people are hesitant about getting the vaccine due to misinformation. Talking about the **miniscule** chance of adverse side effects is only going to make the general public less apt to get the vaccine.  There are people who have legitimate reasons to not get the vaccine and the only way we can protect them is through herd immunity. COVID won't be eradicated until a certain percentage of the population is immune, then the virus can't effectively spread and will die out. \n\nI started off by agreeing with you about the government mandate.  My issue is with your premise, though. \n\nThe information that you're offering up for evidence of the vaccine's side-effects is at best circumstanctial, if not purely anecdotal. The information is available to determine what the chances truly are.\n\nThis is probably one of the best tracked healthcare issues in the US to date, purely because of its spread during the information technology era. While the number of people who have had adverse side effects may number in the thousands, we have enough data points, statistically speaking, to calculate the odds of such an event occuring. The odds are miniscule. You have about the same chance as dying from a bee sting (.0016%). You're more likely to die in a mass shooting (.009%).  \n\nSo to suppose, as you said, \"all those\" people who were in good health that died, the, is not a sound basis for a convincing argument. \n\nThe chances are greater of contracting covid (using the lowest percent chance I could find of .05% which has been proven to be partially false) and dying than getting the vaccine and having an adverse side effect.*\n\n*The importance here is to look at the source for statistics, because they don't tell the whole story. The CDC requires healthcare providers to report any death that occurs with recency to the vaccine regardless of the cause of death. Car accident on your way home from the clinic, overdosing on blow, tripping and breaking your neck, all of those deaths, if they occured near the time when you got your covid shot, they must report. That's the .0019% chance I'm talking about. The number of deaths that are causal by the vaccine are most likely lower. The statistical chance of having an adverse side effect from the vaccine is significantly lower that .0019% chance due to this skewing of statistics. It logically follows that the chance of death from the vaccine is muuuuuch less than .0019%.\n\nEdit to add stats info.",

WE NEVER HEAR ABOUT THEM ON THE NEWS.  These folks share their experiences  online and get censored and removed. Doctors  being silenced with information about known cures.

But if you want to refuse the vaccine, at least know the facts and avoid unnecessary hyperbole, because it doesn't help your case.\n\nOf the people who have gotten the vaccine, .0019% have died.  But not necessarily from getting the vaccine. CDC requires all deaths following covid to be reported to their Vaccine Adverse Effect Reporting System regardless of whether the HCP believes the vaccine was involved.  You could get vaccinated, slip and break your neck on the way out the door and it's reported. The using data collection and analysis they look for trends. One trend is blood clotting and low platelets, but is extremely small percentage. \n\nBecause of the skewed death reporting, you are less likely (percent chance) to experience myocarditis and pericarditis and all of the other reported health issues after getting the covid vaccine. \n\nLet's say that the deaths were all caused by the vaccine compared to an average 55 year old man. That's a .0019% chance vs a .0021% chance of an average male of 55 years of age dying on a given day. Compare that to a .05% chance of dying from covid (which is an inaccurate number, the chance is a little bit higher depending on where you live and your access to healthcare). You are 26 times more likely to die from covid than from the vaccine. \n\nThe verbage I disagree with is that the gov mandate is \"murdering people.\" It's a little ridiculous considering these statistics. The numbers overwhelmingly support getting the vaccine.\n\n\nSources: CDC.  NSC.org",

Marty Makary, a physician and professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, estimates that up to half of that population has been infected at some point with covid-19 and thus have natural immunity from prior infection. At that rate, as many as 46 million unvaccinated Americans have natural immunity, which a new Israeli study just found is 6.7 times more powerful than vaccinated immunity. As more of the unvaccinated catch the virus (at a rate as high as 1 million a day) more and more are recovering and becoming immune.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve had my 6.7x stronger natural immunity, so I\u2019m not required to do anything for the collective.

These 800K were old, fat or ill, not healthy individuals, though you can always say \"what about this guy or that guy\" from some singular annecdotes about healthy people dying. Some of these fatalities were vaccine related deaths counted as covid deaths since the symptoms are the same and you're not counted as vaccinated until 2 weeks after you've gotten your second shot and most who die from vaccine die between 48 hours after shot up to 2 weeks.\n\nPeople are getting covid over and over again... with THE SAME VARIANT. Where have you been? Delta had been dominant for the past year as people got first, second and boosted and got covid again. You arguments are absurb.\n\nNatural Immunity has been found in multiple studies to provide vastly superior immunity to vax.

People become variant factories.\n\nVaccinated people who can still get and transmit virus to each other to an ever so slightly less degree which is offset by them thinking they're safe and engaging more because of it, nullifying that slight benefit is not irrelevant.\n\nIf you choose not to question information from Fauci, CDC, WHO who are proponents of vaccination and will say whatever it takes to push people towards vaccination by painting data in the the most favorable light.. then that's on you.

This version skips the whole mRNA part where your body has to read the mRNA and create the spike protein itself.

They have no consciousness or morals because they select against that. If a company sacrifices profits for morals then that company will have less profits and thus be smaller and less relevant. The result of this is that the major corporations of almost any industry is just an amoral profit machine. This is how it is in your world too.\n\nAs for what makes the CoViD-19 case special, is the fact that the Dollar is about to fall taking the entirety of the current elite with them because almost every fiat currency is tied to the Dollar. Fiat currencies always fall and thousands have fallen before, but this is the first time that a fiat currency is used by the entire world.\n\nI saw these worldwide measures coming a few years in advance, though most people acted like you do now, acting like I was crazy for thinking that the world was on the verge of a worldwide fake disaster for which governments all over the world would retract human rights. Yet here we are. Just as I told.\n\nI could predict this mess because I know what is going on politically and financially. The most powerful people do work together to stay in power. Why would not? They clearly love power as is evidenced by them dedicating their lives to getting it. And now with the Dollar on the verge of collapse they stand to lose it all. You would be a fool to assume that they are going to let that slide. Not to mention the many preparations that they have made that went straight over most people's heads because they were too busy watching the news.\n\nIf you want to understand the current pandemic then you must understand how politics currently works. There is too much to explain, but I would start at understanding the financial system since that plays a major role in the current \"pandemic\". E.g. find out for yourself that the Federal Reserve is a private organisation that owns the USA government and thus by extension the USA. Find out the why the Dollar falls. It is a small start but at least, if you still have some capability for independent thought, it will make it clear to you that something had to happen. For an introduction to this I often refer people to the series \"Hidden Secret of Money\" which does a great job explaining the basics in very easy-to-understand terms and which can be watched for free online.\n\nEither way, most people will be caught by surprise just like how the measures caught them by surprise. I wish the best of luck to you, too. We are all going to need it because tough times are ahead. The mess is only just starting.",

Who profits from reporting CoViD-19 injection deaths?\n\nAlso, corporations like Disney literally write the law through lobbying, and in many kinds of industries (especially the food industries, in my experience) paying the government to have them lie to the public in order to promote products from that industry is common practice (such as with protein requirements, and with dairy after WWII); so we know that Pfizer can likely bribe the government into suppressing data and straight-out lying. And it is also obvious that Pfizer benefits from this. So why would they not do this?\n\n>And in terms of the net impact of getting the shot - the vaccine is also about reducing the impact of COVID - the rates of hospitalization and death are much higher for the unvaccinated than the vaccinated....  \n\nWhere did you get that from?\n\n\nThere are plenty of independent doctors speaking out against the vaccine, but they never get attention on the MSM because the MSM is just propaganda for the bewildered herd. And many of those doctors are shunned by industry for obvious reasons, that being the fact that they are bad for industry's profits. Whistleblowers always get mocked and suppressed on the MSM because they are opposing the one that bribes the MSM. In order to balance out your information you could look them up online as they are easy to find. The government is not an infallible god and making them and their bought sources your only source of information just makes you an easy target for the next Orwellian regime.",

As I illustrated in my other post, the actual protection rate of the injections appears to be far closer to 0% than it is to 100%. So in actuality getting injected does not remove the risk from CoViD-19 and replace it with the risk of the injection, it mostly just adds the risk of the injection to the risk of CoViD-19.",

It's suggested that postinfectious immunity goes 3mo to 5 years with median of 16 months before you inhale your next live RNA virus.\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.04.21267114v1\n\n>METHODS\u00a0Data on confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were extracted from the Israeli Ministry of Health database for the period August to September 2021 regarding all persons previously infected or vaccinated. We compared infection rates as a function of time since the last immunity-conferring event using Poisson regression, adjusting for possible confounding factors.\n\n>RESULTS\u00a0Confirmed infection rates increased according to time elapsed since the last immunity-conferring event in all cohorts. For unvaccinated previously infected individuals they increased from 10.5 per 100,000 risk-days for those previously infected 4-6 months ago to 30.2 for those previously infected over a year ago. For individuals receiving a single dose following prior infection they increased from 3.7 per 100,000 person days among those vaccinated in the past two months to 11.6 for those vaccinated over 6 months ago. For vaccinated previously uninfected individuals the rate per 100,000 person days increased from 21.1 for persons vaccinated within the first two months to 88.9 for those vaccinated more than 6 months ago.\n\n>CONCLUSIONS\u00a0Protection from reinfection decreases with time since previous infection, but is, nevertheless, higher than that conferred by vaccination with two doses at a similar time since the last immunity-conferring event. A single vaccine dose after infection helps to restore protection.\n\nNobody gets out of this with only a single immunity conferring event.",

That's the intention of VAERS.\n\nYes, I get the intention of VAERS and how it is meant to be an indicator. But, the rates *are* higher that what is expected, the red flag has been raised, and the CDC has done nothing to reach out on each of these cases to confirm vaccine involvement. We deserve confirmed numbers if people are to believe in the safety of these vaccines - and what we get from the CDC is downplaying, obfuscation, and silence. If they cannot engender trust by their handling of this system, how can we be expected to believe anything coming out of this organization?\n\nNow, if you really want to talk about bias - how about the Pfizer 95% efficacy study? 40K people studied much earlier in the pandemic than now. Exclusion of symptomatic people that didn't test positive with a faulty PCR test. Participants did not have real world demographic ratio in that fewer blacks, latinos, elderly, people with illnesses were in the study than their percentage of the population would indicate should be in the study. \n\nIn the end, 186 placebo and 8 vaxxed people had confirmed cases of covid from which is derived the Relative Rate of Infection - a confidence building 95% and there is no mention of the Absolute Rate of Infection which is in the 1% range. How about the fact that the vast majority in both groups did not get covid at all - which indicates that your chanced of getting it rare? Well, wouldn't want to give the public any information that would lead them to believe they shouldn't be terrified of covid. No, let's just give them 95% effective and not really explain how that figure is derived and that their Absolute chance of getting infected is incredibly low.\n\nHow about running that efficacy test now, with real world conditions and the right demographic mix? There's your bias.\n\nSome only believe in a study if it's a large randomized control trial. But one RCT that is biased can be misleading compared to multiple smaller studies in which study variables can be smoothed of by virtue of the sheer number of results that indicate positive findings -- like what has been discovered by the meta-analysis of Tess Lawrie in her meta-analysis of Ivermectin. The signal is that it works and is shown many times over in these studies even after one controversial positive result study was removed from the batch.\n\nMultiple confirmations of success will always be better than one large study that will be prey to the biases of those conducting it (and before you go there, blind studies are not always as blind as one would have you believe. And if the trial has inherent biases all the blinding in the world won't matter)",

Every submission to VAERS is not necessarily actually something caused by the vaccine. If rates of reports are higher than what you'd normally see in the population that's when an investigation is made. That's the intention of VAERS.\n\n\n>And, no, there's no base rate bias in looking at the Israeli data.\n\n\nYes, there very much is depending on what the claim is about the Israeli data.

In case u/justgreen71 is still curious, here's a better explanation of base rate bias:\n\nhttps://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/israel-50-of-infected-are-vaccinated",

If presented with\nrelated base rate information (i. e., general information on prevalence) and specific information (i. e. , information pertaining only to a specific case), people tend to ignore the base rate in favor of the individuating information, rather than correctly integrating the two. [2]\"\n\nWow, everyone! Now you're just as smart as Captain Base Rate!!!\n\nSo, now that we got that out of the way. Yes, VAERS are unconfirmed reports, which in repeating that every chance you get is your way of saying they are complete bullshit or fake. Well, 67% are submitted by healthcare professionals and another 5% are from pharmaceutical companies so they are not all self-reports from individually with no medical background.\n\nSo the question to ask is why isn't the CDC, in the middle of a pandemic, not directing some funds or asking for additional funds to investigate the cases reported to VAERS and confirm some of these unconfirmed reports? I realize that's not what VAERS is set up to do... but, hell, they should be doing it under these extraordinary circumstances. Seems the CDC only wants to promote vaccination and not deal with the tsunami of death and side effects from the vaccines. I guess you just don't look for things you don't want to discover.\n\nAnd, no, there's no base rate bias in looking at the Israeli data.",

Dissenting voices are silenced directly or due to fear of losing a job or being shunned by society. Other medications that might save the world are being suppressed to keep the \"all must vax\" narrative alive, and maybe also for pharma profits. Politically, the administration can not afford to be seen as doing nothing, so they will promote vaccination - even if it's the wrong course of action. It may be impossible to stop since to admit that they were wrong would be a catastrophe for them - but to continue will be a catastrophe for us.\n\nDown the road you will realized you've been lied to -- perhaps with the best intentions, or perhaps not; but lied to just the same.

Covid often comes in waves that don't last very long even in absence of interventions. Look what happened in India for example. Covid cases are expected to come down after a rapid rise regardless of what you do. Seasonal effects alone can cause this.",

If you are infected with delta you are as likely to spread as the non-vaxxed. That's what they studies show. Have not seen any good evidence so far that covid spread can effectively controlled with the vax rather the opposite. Even in countries with nearly 100% vax rate the virus spreads extremely well.\n\n>You're still talking anecdotes and small sample sizes. There is no disputing the fact that many more are dead from covid than the vaccine.\n\nFirst of all. I have never claimed that covid vaccines have killed more people than covid, second I think that alone is a very superficial view of things.\n\nAverage age of death for covid is 80. So yes maybe the vaccine is great for that age group but that does not automatically mean someone with a very low risk of dying should take it.\n\nMaybe for some groups the risk benefit ratio is good for others it's horrible.

For obvious reasons, less restrictions means more covid cases. People ignore this aspect and look at two variables: Case numbers and vaccine numbers.

There is no disputing the fact that many more are dead from covid than the vaccine. That is even the case in Australia, despite 80%+ of people being vaccinated and 1% of people being confirmed to have caught it.",

Young people don't just get vaccinated to protect themselves, they get vaccinated to protect others. Not that you guys believe the science of vaccinations reducing the spread.\n\nthey found that protection against infection lasts 3 months and declines rapidly after that. After 6 months protection is negative that means you are more likely to be infected than the non-vaxxed.\n\nThat is what studies in the UK, Sweden, Qatar and Israel have found.  Another study found that on a country level there is no correlation between cases and vax rates. So the idea that you need to vaccinate to protect others is a fantasy based on poor understanding how the vax works. Everyone will be infected with this virus sooner or later and nothing will be able to stop that.\n\n>And replying to your edit above, I am sorry if you don't understand how your anecdote of a single person's heart issues, based on a tiny sample size of who you know is statistically completely irrelevant.\n\nI understand the limitations of small sample size but I also understand the limitations of using incomplete data and undercounting of adverse reactions that are a very common problem in most studies.\n\nHere is what I has happened in my social circle.\n\nWe have 1 case of thrombosis and 1 case of heart problems   post vax in our close social circle. In addition several people I have known for a while had close family members develop blood clots and other cardiovascular problems post vax. Several of such cases and the number of people that I know isn't huge.\n\nA close family member is a doctor and worked in one of the world's covid hotspots during the pandemic with thousands of patients. He had more people go to the hospital from problems caused by vax than people going to the hospital because of covid. He told me that most doctors don't report adverse reactions.\n\nOfficially the rate of blood clots post vax is 1 in 100000 and for heart problems it's 1 in 20000 maybe. So statistically it's unlikely that we would see that many cases if these adverse reactions were that rare. Either we were really unlucky or what is more likely is that most reactions to the vax are never registered or reported.",

How far apart? Also, boosters don\u2019t add efficiency to prior doses of mRna. The schedule is for waning and loss of efficacy over time. It\u2019s a \u201cre-up,\u201d not a \u201cbuild up,\u201d and sometimes it\u2019s neither as different strains are sliding through like a hot knife in butter. You can feel how you want about mRna vaccines and the outcome of this data, and id have no emotion about it at all. But preemptively treating Covid is not a long term solution or one as well as treating it post infection. People will grow immune to spike proteins. We already see people fully vaccinated with a booster or two still suffering pretty strong symptoms. This is a crapshoot.\n\nEdited: context",

We all know the risk of ending up in the hospital with Covid is extremely low for most age groups in both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.  No no no,  now we all need to be worried about long Covid and it's wide variety of symptoms.  According to mainstream  media, 50% of Covid survivors will end up with long term symptoms, so rate of infections are the only thing that really matters.\n\nAt this point, with data from the UK, vaccinated people were 4x as likely to catch Covid.  The severity of infection has no impact on whether or not someone catches long Covid.  So per UK data, you can take a vaccine that maybe, just maybe will make your initial infections less severe, but also make you more likely to become infected thus increasing your risk of contracting long Covid.\n\nDoes it seem logical to accept a treatment that decreases the miniscule risk of severe infection in the short term but makes those that receive it more prone to long term symptoms at a must greater risk compared to short term benefits?  No it is not logical and there's really nothing you dumb asses can say that changes that.",

Laboratory confirmation and presence of residual paralysis was not required . In 1955 the criteria were changed to conform more closely to the definition used in the 1954 field trials : residual paralysis was determined 10 to 20 days after onset of illness and again 50 to 70 days after onset. The influence of the field trials is still evident in most health departments ; unless there is residual involvement at least 60 days after onset, a case of poliomyelitis is not considered paralytic\"\n\nPolio vaccines were not the success we have been led to believe.",

Infection-acquired immunity directed against other VOCs may be broader in nature and may wane more slowly than that induced by vaccines[46](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.03.21268111v1.full-text#ref-46)\u2013[48](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.03.21268111v1.full-text#ref-48). The level of protection following previous infection was 53.2% for Omicron, and 88.7% for Delta. This level of protection was greater than two doses of vaccine but did not reach levels attained by those who had never had natural infection and had received third dose boosters.\n\nThe virus causes clotting and myocarditis.

(You had healthy 30sometgings getting sick/ dying, while Holocaust survivors drank oj, took a nap, woke up and made brisket..) \n\nNo, not really: because we didn\u2019t have tests in early to mid 2020, and we didn\u2019t mandate weekly tests for the entire country, we honestly do not know how many people contracted Covid19 due to them being asymptomatic or having a triflingly mild case & based on how some states (like Florida..) were hiding case counts and deaths we are really in a blind spot ~ some estimates put the US exposure at 130mil, which if it is true kneecaps post exposure immunity due to us not knowing if a person was infected for the first time or reinfected. \n\nSmall fact: South Africa has the youngest population on the planet, thus the mindset was that they would fare well against Covid\u2014 whereby the virus mutated into Omicron. \n\n>This isn\u2019t the first\u2026 \n\n-SARS, H1N1, etc\u2026 paved the way for us to make pandemic protocols- the Army published its plan of action once it was discovered that the Bush/ Obama plan had been jettisoned by Trump\u2026  \nThe primary takeaway is that these other viruses weren\u2019t as robust as Covid19, nor did they attack their host bodies as this virus does which is why we never went into closures/ mandate phases in the past. \n\n[The death count at the end of the year tally from the coroner\u2019s offices is accurate- and the volume of people with secondary health problems after having had it is troubling.] \n\n>Public health should be straight forward logic.  \n\n-Truth. \n\n>If you feel sick stay home.  \n\n-It isn\u2019t a question of feeling ill, it\u2019s a matter of having more tests for people to do more self checks: asymptomatic don\u2019t know they have it, and people who sneeze once or twice and don\u2019t have any other symptoms aren\u2019t going to think they are infected. \n\n>prescribing controversial drugs..\n\n-Negative ghost rider, nope. \nIt\u2019s speculated that India tried using Ayurvedic treatments, as well as off label usage of certain drugs\u2014 which *possibly* gave us Delta & Delta+ \nPart of the problem with the use of controversial drugs is that the people who took them/ claim that they worked were probably going to clear the virus without taking them; also, we\u2019ve documented cases of people that were self administering these drugs and died. \n\n>Straightforward logic was not used at any point in this pandemic.  \n\n-The pandemic became political and financial under the prior administration, which is a major disappointment. \nWhether you like/ dislike the current administration, they\u2019ve cleaned up a lot of their mess and are keeping things as neutral as possible \u2013 the problem is that the horse is already through the gate for 25% of the country.. \n\nAs for money: R&D & dissemination of the final product is costly. \nThere\u2019s no way around that. \nIf you wish to view that as funneling money to the top, so be it; however, I\u2019d take the power grab out of the assessment.",

Allow treatments and early intervention for symptomatic patients, even if their doctors are prescribing controversial drugs, a person decisions regarding their health should be between themselves and their health care provider. \n\nStraightforward logic was not used at any point in this pandemic.

With this flu you must be blinded by propaganda to get it, knowing the failures of mrna in the past and now clearly the failure in those who were foolish enough to be a lab rat.\n\nFor the time scale it's again bs.

Depending on your age you are most likely [perfectly safe from it.](https://datavisualizations.heritage.org/public-health/covid-19-deaths-by-age/)\n\n\n2.

Hard to believe people who care about none of this when they say their actions are because they care about others.\n\n\n3. The [main test they use is not accurate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32219885/), its [own creator admits this](https://off-guardian.org/2020/10/05/pcr-inventor-it-doesnt-tell-you-that-you-are-sick/),\u00a0 often and [easily giving false positives.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2095096/)\n\n\n4. The vaccines [haven't even been properly tested](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728?term=NCT04368728&draw=2&rank=1), and already show a steady decline in effectiveness according to Swedish studies, and which [Lord Fauci even admits](https://news.yahoo.com/dr-fauci-just-issued-urgent-201846228.html). Hell the testing can't even tell us [if the vaccines save lives](https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/covid-19-vaccine-trials-cannot-tell-us-if-they-will-save-lives/). Let us not forget the [terrifying VAERS data](https://www.skirsch.com/covid/VCage.pdf). And this is all with serious risks like [heart inflammation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html) and [general worsening](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.144.suppl_1.10712) of [heart conditions](https://www.thecardiologyadvisor.com/home/topics/acs/acute-coronary-syndrome-acs-biomarkers-mrna-covid19-vaccine/)\nand [blood clots](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-antibodies-cause-blood-clots-side-effect) among other concerns such as [sloppy data, untrustworthy companies, a lack of liability, and professional censorship](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/vaccine-hesitancy-medical-paradigms/). In fact, the [higher the vaccination rate the more excess morality](https://www.skirsch.com/covid/GermanAnalysis.pdf). BTW they want 55 years to release the information that led to approval of the vaccines. Imagine a polio vaccine that didn't last, came out in 1 year, and didn't keep you from catching, spreading, and possibly even still dying of polio, but had a risk of worsening your life as well, and data wouldn't be shared about its approval for 5 decades. It's further possible the way the shot has been treated violates the [Nuremberg Code.](http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/nuremberg/)\n\n\n5.

Pediatricians have warned against holding pox parties, however, citing dangers arising from possible complications associated with chickenpox, such as encephalitis, chickenpox-associated pneumonia, and invasive group A strep.[11][13][14] These serious complications (e.g. brain damage or death) are vastly more likely than vaccine adverse events.[15][16] Before the chickenpox vaccine became available, 100 to 150 children in the U.S. died from chickenpox annually.[14][17] In the UK, chickenpox vaccinations are not routine, and around 25 people die a year from the disease, with 80% of victims being adults, in the late 1990s.[18] The chickenpox vaccine is now recommended by health officials, citing vastly superior safety when compared with infection.[8][19] \n\nThank you for getting me to reconsider my position so it won't be so absolute in future.",

ALL of the mods are anti-vaxxers. Good faith debate almost never happens here. Every third post is a video with no debate question asked. \n\nIf your goal is to reach people who have been harmed by misinformation (the way our friends and family have been) you are better off sorting major subs by controversial on vaccine issues - this place is controlled and will make sure your correct information is only seen by people who are INCAPABLE of understanding it, let alone believing it . \n\nIf you're like me and just wanted to get more insight into the anti-vaxxer mind - you don't need to post to find that stuff out. \n\nAs far as rule breaking:\n\n3 separate people here have stalked my real life identity and their comments were not removed. Anti-vaxxers constantly insult others and nothing happens.\n\nThe mods themselves constantly break the rules, this is a direct quote from /u/Calithrix:\n\n\"Please get your head out of your ass.\"\n\nI asked the mods if there could be a pro-vax person on the mod team for balance (like how every other debate sub works that actually has good faith debate).\n\nTheir response?\n\n\"If you think that we should be \u201cfair\u201d by allowing COVID-propagandists become a part of this mod team, then you should be protesting every sub with a \u201cmisinformation\u201d disclaimer and make sure that every other sub has anti-vaxxers on their mod team\u2014especially COVID related subs. \n\nI'm done here, obviously you can't debate in good faith if the mods are also pushing propaganda and can't even enforce even debate between the sides - the mods don't even believ ethere are two sides, that we're just \"propagandists\".\n\nWe are bolstering their confidence and enabling them for no benefit, and its keeping the admins from seeing this sub for what it really is. \n\nEdges8 does a great job here exposing how no anti=-vaxxers can argue properly or have any understanding of the science. In every thread he is in, he consistently wins every debate he takes part in with valid evidence and with the commenter ALWAYS resorting to insults and saying he's being paid, with the comments NEVER being removed. \n\nI think its possible edges8 has gotten through to some pepole. Anybody with a decent IQ can see his arguments are superior and anti-vaxxers can't stand by anything they say. \n\nBut based on the mod team and the userbase ... i don't think any difference is being made.\n\nI learned a bit about anti-vaxxers posting here, and its given me more confidence conronting family/friends knowing that even the \"smart\" ones cannot defend their views and have no ability to go even 3 sentences on topic without lying or insulting. I also got a chance to see anti-vax \"Sources\" to find out what they considered real information.\n\nSo it wasn't a total lost cause.\n\nBut there is no reason a pro-science person should post to this anti-vax sub that has no interest in fostering debate between the two sides. Posting here is a noble but fruitless cause."
