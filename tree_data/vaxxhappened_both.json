Some research shows you get BETTER immunity against delta via infection compared to immunization.  \n\nAnd what about people who can't get vaxxed for medical reasons?  Are you just supposed to hate them as much as anyone else?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlus what do you suggest the end result is?  Passports are already being faked, so that limits their effectiveness, IF they were effective to begin with.  Ontario just gets a printed sheet of paper.  What happens if you loose it, or it gets wet, or set on fire?  You can't easily replace it since it's issued to you at time of vaccination.  Some countries don't have a universal passport yet, and some countries don't want one period.  How do you handle that?  Because if you're just looking at the US you're forgetting how Delta spread to being with.  It wasn't in NA originally, it spread though travellers, and shipped goods.  \n\nThe problem is not limited to just one country, and starting a war with one another is bad enough without ignoring the fact that problem is in more then one country.",

Next road is to jail. The Cops don't care, they got a (potential)murderer of the streets, who cares about who it is.(Unless personal reasons like being a fan of Celebrity, or being a crooked cop.)\n\nLater, when they check the knife, well Mr. Celebrity touched the knife(Why do they do that in most horror/horror-romance movies I will never know.) and now it's HIS DNA most prominent on the knife, he's suspected of murder. Maybe 10 months later(or more) he's finally found not-guilty and freed from suspicion, unless the murder search found him in possesions of illegal substances, or have comitted illegal acts. This sort of thing, \"Person 1 did X, got consequence Y because Person 2 found him and assumed wrong thing.\"\n\nThis example was for why context can and will matter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Maybe you know all this, maybe you don't. If you didn't, then I sincerely hope that I've helped in some small way. Being lonely doesn't mean you get to do whatever you want. If you disagree with all of this then you can disagree but prepare to be ignores and shunned. You don't have to like the rules but it's not a rule that was made in order to shut you up. It's a rule made to make women feel safer. And it sucks that there needs to be a rule like that but there does. You didn't ruin it, men long before us did that. And I think it's okay to follow social norms if it makes people feel safer. \n\nOh that, I definetly don't think that because I'm lonely I get to be a total asshole.  Quite the opposite, and when I'm not lonely, that doesn't mean I can be a dick to people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> If you're going through some shit feel free to PM\n\nWell, thanks I guess? I've never heard that so it's good to have the option, thanks for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I really am just trying to explain it and hopefully I didn't insult you \n\nYou didn't insult me, you explained what you wanted and that's a good skill to have, being able to explain things as you want.",

If he said that to a girl just randomly while walking down the street it would actually be kind of creepy. Now if it was a meet n greet where celebrities are expected to be fun and social and he said it as a clear joking, friendly sort of thing then it'd go over way better.\n\nContext matters man. Here is a picture of a young girl getting a vaccine. Nowhere does it say that she's asking for pickup lines or compliments about her smile.\n\nIt's a well known fact by now that saying something like \"smile, you're prettier when you smile\" is NOT wanted. You're debasing them and equating them to just an object. An object of beauty, sure, but an object nonetheless.\n\nMaybe you know all this, maybe you don't.

People care because she has had the unfortunate luck of being born to ignorant, bigoted, ableist, anti-vaxx parents. These are people who have denied her this life-saving medicine all her life.\n\nYet despite their best attempts, she has chosen to follow the science rather than their ignorance.\n\nShe is not the first person to do this. In fact, you can find similar highly-upvoted posts made y young men in this same sub. But it's rare enough that it's a pretty big deal when it does happen.\n\nTL;DR: She's not being upvoted because she got vaccinated; we've all been vaccinated. She's being upvoted she got vaccinated *against her ignorant parents' wishes*.\n\nWe like it when anti-vaxxers lose a battle. This is a battle anti-vaxxers lost. *That* is the big deal.",

So there's an old brain and a new brain for humans, which enables humans to solve both old and new types of problems. The old brain works as a kind of survival autopilot, using instinct and emotion. The new brain is there to deal in the abstract when necessary, using symbols and pattern recognition.\n\nWhat I do now is recognise when I'm facing an 'old problem' (anything a prehistoric ancestor might have also dealt with) and make a conscious effort to not figure it out as an abstract puzzle, but instead pause to get a better feel for what's going on, and act on my emotions.

One of the categories they look for during diagnosis is an absence of empathy or lack of ability to perspective take (put yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes or explain how something may impact them as opposed to how it affects you). This presents very different in females than males though. Males will often have trouble \u201cfeeling with\u201d someone or guessing how someone else might be feeling in a situation. \n\nFor the longest time I did not even consider autism as a diagnosis for myself because I thought autistic people don\u2019t have empathy. This is not the case. I have huge amount of empathy for the people I love. I have never been more heartbroken then when I saw my boyfriend cry at his mothers funeral. My heart literally broke for the pain he went through. \n\nFor females, this characteristic (atypical empathy) often shows up in a misunderstanding of how other people must be feeling. For me, I thought I knew what other people were feeling, but I was way off. I assumed people were feeling waaaay more than they actually were. My kids for example, when they argue over a toy, I assume that that toy is the most important thing in the world to them and that they must have it or their world will fall apart - based on their very dramatic reactions. This results in me being a very push over mom. I feel TOO MUCH empathy and need to fix the situation immediately for both kids somehow and this causes extreme anxiety for myself. Any time my kids whine or are upset even a smidge, I get instantly high alert and anxious. \n\nSo to sum up, atypical empathy can mean that you have an inability to understand how someone else might be feeling outside of what you are feeling, or a misjudgment of those feelings and the degree of them.",

Doctors actually receive very little training on vaccines. Generally they are just given a schedule and told to follow it. There are a lot of questions surrounding the vaccine industry. They are not regulated like regular drugs. Just the fact that a bill was passed in the 90's which essentially made it impossible to sue vaccine companies should raise some eyebrows. Furthermore the government has set up a trust fund that is used to settle cases of vaccine damage. Obviously the big pharma is going to love vaccines because they are a cash cow with little regulation and zero liability. There have been a lot of studies that show a correlation between modern day diseases and vaccinations. Is this causation? That is the question. Fact is there are a lot of potentially toxic ingredients that could be more harmful than good. In the pre 80's autism was very rare like 1 on 15k. Now it's like one in 15 (stats may be a little off but you get the point). I guess the point is that this is a debate worth having. Remember those really long commercials on tv for all these great new medications, that's where stations get a lot of their funding, so just because you don't hear news stories about the possibility that vaccines may not be great is because they will not risk losing funding. I have a new son, and have been looking into the matter for that reason. It's actually pretty scary when you see the facts and statistics. Not saying don't vaccinate, but maybe some vaccines are much more dangerous than others and maybe giving your 2 month old 9 doses at a time is not a good idea. "

That is certainly an incentive. Of course it's not the main moneymaker, because covid only existed recently.\n\nAlso, you're right, outpatient and elective surgery ARE the moneymakers. Question though, how many elective surgeries are going on right now? Might be a little higher now that lockdowns are relaxing, but what about when everything was locked down? I couldn't get a yearly checkup until like July, when I was due for it in March. The elective procedures that typically made money were not happening. So, if grandma comes in with pneumonia and needs to be put on the ventilator, you can make some of that back by putting it down as a Covid-19 related pneumonia. \n\nDid this happen? I don't think we can really know, since when it would occur, it'd be indistinguishable from another disease (because covid a symptoms aren't really all that novel). \n\nRegardless, there is certainly an incentive regardless of whether it's being capitalized on or not.",

In a system with as many moving parts as ours, fraud/mistakes are inevitable -- especially under the increased pressure of a pandemic. I assert that any intentional upcoding is so rare as to not significantly impact ... well... anything. To make it financially worthwhile, a hospital would have to miscode a lot of people, and it would involve a conspiracy of at least several, and the chances of multiple people conspiring on something like that without detection (or one of them getting cold feet) are slim, IMO. And to have any meaningful impact on pandemic numbers, such a conspiracy would have to involved LOTS of medical establishments and hundreds of people.   \n\nIt's one of the (few... very few) benefits of our health insurance set up. Insurers are watching like hawks for anything even REMOTELY resembling fraud, often to the point of denying coverage on some treatment by default, only to approve it on appeal (the thinking being X% of people won't appeal, which is $ saved). (And, yes, I realize in the case of COVID there's a secondary source of revenue from such diagnoses: Money from the CARES act, which I believe would be far easier to obtain fraudulently given our government's \"oversight? wuzzat\"? attitude; but such fraudsters would have to also be defrauding the insurance companies OR keeping 2 sets of records, one for CARES and one for insurance, which seems like a recipe for getting caught).  \n\nHoly crap, sorry for the wall of text.

It may be very Pollyanna of me, but given that she's wearing a mask and getting the vaccine, we can hope that perhaps she's realised that she was a fool and changed her mind, which is what we want to see.  And, even if she hasn't, this may still speak to other Conservatives and encourage them to do the same?  A girl can hope!  lol. In all seriousness though, I have to applaud that she's doing it and being public about it and hope that maybe some people who have been obstinately refusing to believe in the severity and seriousness of the pandemic will, in turn, change their minds as well. We have to give credit to those who are changing their minds and forgive them their earlier stupidity or they have no one. The right will be furious they took it and the left crying \"hypocrite!\" will cause fewer people to get the vaccine, even if they see the rightness of it, FINALLY!!!  Our goal needs to be getting as many vaccinated as possible, so I'm going to cheer them on. I wouldn't vote for them but at least they're doing their part in stopping the spread in this area, at least?\n\nIt should be noted, my first thought was what a horrible hypocrite but after looking at it for a few minutes, I changed my mind. Doesn't mean she's a good person only that she she's a vaccinated idiot",

So there can be no single cause.  \nBut we do know some risk factors: for example, there is a genetic component to it, and the risk goes up with the age of the parents. We also now know that whatever the cause is, autism is something you are born with, which is another nail in the coffin for blaming vaccines - they're simply too late to be the cause.

Clinically not only do they lie about medical history but they also are non-compliant when it comes to actual medical care when there is disease onset (for example refusal to give medication to the diseased infant).\n\nFor full honesty most of the effects of the anti vaxx movement will only come to full bloom in about 10 years and some of these children enter adulthood.\nThe rest is felt every day by hospital professionals and children that are in fragile states of immunity and that can't be protected via vaccine.\n\nWorking in science nowadays and attempting to communicate with laymen is disheartening.\n\nThe sumation of all human knowledge lives in our pockets and people still choose to go with non science supported themes.\n\nTo add that the current opinion on why underprivileged countries are more compliant with vaccination programmes stems from the fact that medical record protection is iffy and death in childhood is something that is seen every day. \n\nI can go down to peds and make videos of the sub 2 year olds that are in the infecto-ward but I would lose my job, can also guarantee that like most parents before what is happening in those rooms and the parental responsibility  will be kept under rugs, perpetuating this malarkey.\n\nAnd if in doubt here is one example provided by a parent:\nhttps://youtu.be/zuK4honWVsE\n\nAbility to feed is affected\n\n\nAbility to play and progress cognitively is affected \n\n\nAbility to socialize is affected \n\n\nWell being is affected.\n\n\nThis is preventable.\n\n\nIt might not be a deadly disease for most but the effect is nefarious and and obstacle to a development in full potential.\n\nAlso in full disclaimer: I work in the us but am from a country with universal healthcare. There is no real \"medical industry\" or \"big pharma\" it is ilegal to advertise medication since health is not considered a business and the medical care and schedule is simply designed to reduce the amount of time people have to spend in hospitals so health care doesn't create an even bigger governmental budget hole.\n\n\nAnd since I am on the internet I can actually say what I think: this crunchy anti-vaxx bullshit is a medal that science uneducated people use while refusing their own role on the poor care they are providing to their children. These unvaxxed children are effectively excluded to many other types of future care in case it is needed, like organ transplants (being donors or receivers), access to higher, better quality education (for example TA'ing is incredibly valuable and an indicator of good future employment and not allowed to non vaxxers ).\n\n\nThe effect of childhood adversity (disease is one form of adversity) is devastating:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3680281/\n\nAnd we have a current ongoing unwanted human experiment going on on what are the differences between populations that go through good care vs bad care:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/18647440/\n\nNorth Koreans are the only population in the world with size regression.",

And then you have the group that receives the medication. The scientists nor the participants know which one they received. This is how you make the tests unbiased and can ensure accurate data. At the end of the trial, you know if something works by the differences between the groups. With vaccines, the placebo group would have infection rates which match the normal, unvaccinated infection rates. Whereas the vaccine group would have a significantly lower infection rate.

Stop allowing them to profit from users, and increase traffic, storage, etc., in order to create a net-cost. In other words, use their service in a way that they can't profit and will lose money.

It's rare, but volunteers have been part of unions, and students, for example, can have a union even though they are paying their school/university. There's arguably a contract between Reddit and its moderators, and they benefit from the unpaid labour of the moderators. To that extent, volunteers should be able to request better working conditions.  \nUsing a union as a form of collective bargaining, in order to improve the working conditions of volunteer moderators, would also mean that if Reddit retaliates by firing/removing moderators, it could be argued to be a violation of US labour laws.",

The Moderna and the Johnson&Johnson vaccines have Emergency Use Authorizations by the FDA. Moderna has just put in their request for full approval and J&J has not.  If you want a more complex answer based on efficacy, studies, etc. I can give that but I think the most pertinent answer to this question would be that you should go with Pfizer if you can, however each of them has proven to be effective at most importantly keeping you out of the hospital if you happen to get it, and second-most importantly reducing the chance that you catch it in the first place. So if you can't find  Pfizer then it would be worth it to get whatever is convenient for you of the three.  \n\n* There are some cons and side effects, I'm going to tell you to be honest, but bear with me. The most likely side effects are soreness where they give you the vaccine. Because your immune system reacts to it (which is intended) some people feel for a few days like they might be sick, but that is again mild and it does not last long. Like any medical treatment on Earth it's not 100% safe, BUT we do know for a fact that the odds of having any significant reaction to the vaccine are very very low. From the day of the first EUA given by the FDA, they have watched and studied each of them like a hawk to see if there was any significant risks, and in regards to the actual vaccines they have not found any issues. J&J did have one of their suppliers get in trouble for their standards, but that has been an isolated issue. Once you are fully vaccinated, there are no cons. You should consider getting a booster/3rd dose if Pfizer/Moderna when the CDC says to, because the CDC is trying to keep up with any variants to make sure we get as much bang for the buck as possible with the vaccines we have. In all cases, the risks and cons of catching COVID-19 far outweigh the risks of getting a vaccine, even if you believe you are otherwise pretty healthy.  \n\n* At the end of the day when it comes to people who are vaccine-hesitant, it takes very little for them to find a reason to say know and fight for it, and it takes a tremendous amount of effort to convince even one to get the vaccine. People are set on clinging to what they think is right, even if it sounds like doomsayers at a UFO convention. What distinguishes people who are dead-set on being vaccine hesitant from people who ultimately get the vaccine in my personal opinion is the capacity to accept information which comes from a trustworthy and rigorous source. For instance, if a person believes that all scientists across the world are in league to falsify their research and that every government across the world is conspiring against their citizens, then it is unlikely that any amount of evidence is ever going to change their mind. Others are like you, you asked good questions, and you deserve good answers. I challenge a lot of anti-vaxxers online but I always make the same offer: If you have questions, I will answer you. If you want sources, I'll provide them. I spent 3 years doing medical biology masters work, another 3 teaching biology/anatomy and if there's any way I can help you make a decision for yourself I will :)",

As a health care professional, I along with most of my colleagues worldwide support any attempt to stem the tide and spread of harmful health misinformation and lies which affect everyone, not just those participating in their promulgation. When a site like reddit appears to allow it without consequence, it only furthers the idea that this conspiratorial and scientifically illiterate rubbish is somehow valid and legitimate criticism and gives the impression of false balance. The people spreading it appear to want to do so without consequence (which they characterise wrongly as 'discrimination') by equating it to issues of 'free speech', which does not apply here. At this point the world is a crowded theatre and their actions are tantamount to shouting \"Fire!\", long established as an exception to allowances made for free speech.\n\nMost of us learned in early childhood that actions and choices come with consequences. They have made a choice to take actions which endanger the rest of society and as such, we ask that society, in this particular instance reddit, give them some consequences to limit the harm they can do by spreading their nonsense on this site. This is neither unreasonable nor excessive, and by refusing to take meaningful action reddit becomes complicit in their activities. \n\nI, and millions of other professionals like me, can only hope that reddit reconsiders their position and puts the health and wellbeing of their global community of redditors first and foremost by taking meaningful action against these dangerously misguided people, who are using this site to further their misinformation campaigns to the detriment of the rest of humanity.",

Still encourage others to get it despite my struggle.) [Here's a little example of my views on the subject in some comment discussion recently.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/onuwfg/an_engineer_and_an_antivaxxer_walk_up_to_a_bridge/h5x3pzt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nSO much research has demonstrated that when you look for evidence to support your claim (any claim, any thought, not just pro/anti-vaxxing) you will find it. If you search for evidence to refute another's, you WILL find it. Social media algorithms are nefarious and will famously flood a person with information it thinks they want to see... maybe you support Gender Equality(typically associated with liberals), but are otherwise a moderate, you search from some Gender Equality information, and inside of a year you'll be dragged to the left side of MANY issues. Perhaps you enjoy target shooting or hunting(typically associated with conservatives), You'll be fed heaploads of right-wing opinions, probably shaping your views on things you'd otherwise not generally concern yourself with.\n\nMy point is... there's a fine line between combating disinformation, and trampling on someone's freedoms... freedom of choice, freedom of expression/speech in particular. Someone who might otherwise not have a strong opinion on vaxxing (or any issue, really) is easily influenced to one side or the other by whoever gets to them first. They'll already be pre-disposed to the foundation views they've been led to, and when the opposing side is stamping their feet and yelling \"DUMBASS, IT'S COMMON SENSE!\" is NOT going to change their mind (no matter how true it may be). I would caution everyone to meet ignorance with wisdom, being more intelligent than the dumb-asses who think COVID vaccines are a CIA mind-control device doesn't mean just jumping up and down and calling the little morons names... be kind... Ban hammer them gently...:D\n\nThere will always be zealots that can't be educated (\"The CIA mind control probes from your vaccine made you find all that \"scientific research\" - admit it!\"). So leave their unvaxxed asses be and let evolution do it's job.  \n\n\nEDIT: corrected a typo.",

These posts collectively gathered hundreds of thousands of upvotes, with users showing their support in the comments, and several large media outlets picking it up. Subsequently the admins posted a response to /r/Announcements, in which they stated that this misinformation would be allowed on their site, and that they will continue to action communities that violate their sitewide rules, including encouraging fake vaccine cards & \"encouraging harm\". They finished the announcement with a thinly veiled threat of punishing moderators who have participated in this protest, if it continues. The post was immediately locked, making it impossible to directly respond to.\n\nThis statement from the admins is hypocritical, dishonest, and misrepresentative of the situation on their site. They are portraying the misinformation as simply discussion that criticises the majority opinion, when it is far more than that: It is discussion that actively advises against government guidelines, opting to follow disproven studies and anecdotal evidence. As stated in our original letter, this type of misinformation is dangerous. The admins are pretending like it is not. As redditors, we should come together against this harmful propaganda.\n\nReddit's CEO /u/spez is claiming that the admins will take action on communities that \"encourage harm\", while allowing subreddits that advocate not taking an FDA-approved vaccine in favor of taking unapproved drugs, the effects of which have not been studied. Most notably is Ivermectin, a drug used to treat parasites and that the FDA has explicitly advised against using for Covid is often recommended by antivaxx subreddits, most notably r/Ivermectin. This type of misinformation is actively endangering people. The admins are simply sticking their head in the sand, and refusing to take any responsibility for the damage that their inaction is causing.  \n\nUntil Reddit takes action, we will continue to speak out against subreddits which exist solely to spread medical disinformation.\n\n\n# Here's how you can help: When you see antivaxx comments or submissions report them to the admins using this link:\n\n# https://www.reddit.com/report?reason=this-is-misinformation"

And normally found in older guys from 45-70. There are no usual heath markers like smoking or drinking besides ... sexy times. \n\nThis is her 3rd surgery as were trying to avoid chemo and radiation and hope to be done after this if they can get negative margins around the tumor. \n\nShe had the old HPV vaccine and even the Drs told her when she got it at 26 it was probably too late by then and probably didn\u2019t include the p16 strain. \n\nThe best time to get the current HPV shots is before you are ever sexually active. \n\nThanks for helping out!!",

I'm glad you've taken the other approach, demonstrating that while there is a very small chance of there being any harm caused by vaccines, getting vaccinated has a much higher chance of protecting people than it does of causing detrimental side-effects. And that the people who are affected negatively by them are at further risk of having their immune systems compromised by other people's illnesses, so it's a generally good idea to have most of the population inoculated in order to keep not only themselves safe, but especially those who do not have the option of being vaccinated.",

On their own though, they can only go so far, which is why no country in the world, no matter how high its standard of living, has seen a decrease in non-preventable illnesses of the same level as preventable illnesses.

You can do anything you god damn please, you just have to face the consequences. Like me, posting information I know will only serve to bring negativity upon me. But I do it because if just one other person, like yourself, can see through the bullshit, to know they are not the minority but that they are actually the majority, then it is worth it.  \n\n\nI did not say \"don't vaccinate\" I did not say \"vaccines don't work\", in fact I did the opposite! But these people have a hive mind, and the hive has programmed them to respond to anything negative about vaccines with hate. They are programmed to believe and follow only that which the hive allows. Criticizing vaccines is not allowed, even from published medical journals.\n\nWhat are some other things you aren't allowed to question?",

Does that also mean diabetics should stop taking insulin or the blind should stop wearing glasses because they're \"a BILLION dollar industry\" \n\n>Do your research based on facts and not just taking the Dr's words for it. \n\nBy \"facts\", do you mean easily disputed arguments that only fit your argument and denying the multiple benefits to vaccinations without any evidence?",

It has been around for at least two decades and is transmitted from animals to humans and then from humans to humans. It is said to have originated from eating cats, bats, and camels (depending on the strain). 2019-nCoV is a supposedly new strain of the coronavirus that surfaced in mid-December 2019 from a seafood market in China.\n\nNow follow with me:\n\nIn 2004, the CDC filed a patent on a newly isolated coronavirus known as SARS. It expired on January 24, 2020 -- pure coincidence given the timing of this media outbreak I'm sure.\n\nIn 2015, the Pirbright Institute filed a patent for a live attenuated coronavirus to be used in the production of vaccines. The Pirbright Institute is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and recently received $5.5 million dollars to do what they do. They were \"coincidentally chosen\" to create the vaccine behind this current outbreak.\n\nThey will be partnering with Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) to create said vaccine. This company brought you the zika quackxine in a record-breaking 7 months (run ... just ... run).\n\nInovio Pharmaceuticals will be partnering with Wistar (funded by Bill and Melinda Gates), GeneOne (funded by Bill and Melinda Gates and sponsored by the US FDA) and Twist Biosciences (funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). If the Wistar Institute sounds familiar, it should. This is the company that produced the WI-38 cell line derived from the \"too many to count\" aborted fetuses in the vaccines injected into your children.\n\nOctober 18 2019. Event 201 is a high-level pandemic exercise hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and none other than the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nThis is extremely fascinating because this pandemic simulation exercise of coronavirus took place about 6 weeks before the first illness from the coronavirus was actually reported in Wuhan China!\n\nThat is one hell of a coincidence if you believe in that sort of thing. Another fascinating connection, is the fact that not only did the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation participate in and help set up the pandemic simulation of a coronavirus outbreak, but they just so happen to fund the group who owns the patent to the deadly coronavirus and who some how was able to create the vaccine for it within just a couple hours \ud83e\udd14 Again an incredible coincidence\u2026\n\nAll this and the perfect timing of Netflix's new PANDEMIC documentary, how convenient, just another coincidence?\n\nAND LASTLY, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Director-General for the World Health Organization (WHO) was a top Executive and Central Committee member of the Tigray People Liberation Front (TPLF), which is a political party in Tigray, Ethiopia, and is a Global blacklisted terrorist organisation. Now this is the guy looking after the worlds health, hmmmm, scary stuff.\n\nYou really can't make this stuff up. Too many coincidences for my liking.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nDid Bill Gates & World Economic Forum Predict Coronavirus Outbreak?

The reason it doesn\u2019t it because the vaccine strains can cause it. \n\nSure with the current data (15 years) from the vaccine manufacturer it looks like the vaccine strain causes shingles about half as often (in vaccinated people) as the wild type but it is not sure if this trend continues. \n\nOther countries predict that vaccine induced immunity will not protect as well as wild type because of the lack of exogenous boosting in the population and. When it comes to shingles this would mean an increase in cases later in life even in people who had the vaccine. Because of this they do not vaccinate kids but rather vaccinate teens that did not develop immunity in the past. Reasons for this are an increase in shingles cases in countries that vaccinate. \n\nI hope these predictions are wrong and the amount of shingles will stay at about 50% of what it used to be for vaccinated people. This means that people who were not vaccinated just have to go trough an increased rate of shingles to in favor of the vaccinated generations after them.\n\nEdit for clarity:\nThere are new vaccines out there that do give about 90% protection against shingles. These are relatively new so these were not around when the \"we do not vaccinate kids against chickenpox\" decision in europe was made. It will be interesting to see if this changes the policy. I just wanted to point out how the OP was wrong assuming the chickenpox vaccine protects against shingles.\n\n[Here is a picture showing the mysterious increase in shingles](https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/images/shingles-rates-1992-2010.gif) seen in the US but not seen in countries that do not vaccinate. That said people in the US should get the vaccine and preferably the shingles vaccine too. While many cases can be made for not vaccinating small kids statistics show that the most suffering occurs when between 20 and 80% of the population is vaccinated. This means that if your county vaccinates you should get it to keep everyone safe. It should even be made mandatory in those countries.  If the amount of vaccinated people is under 80% that means that many people do not get it as a kid and more pregnant people are at risk. This results in an increased amount of deaths. When below 20% it is fair to assume people get is as a kid and it is not that bad. When everyone is vaccinated this is better but it also means you need to keep it up. This is why not vaccinating may be the better option for some countries when predicsions show the 80% will not be reached.\n\nSometimes the science behind public health is hard and there is no easy decision. People will be hurt with any decision that is made, it just comes down to reducing the amount and looking at the economic impact.",

I get why someone wouldn't want the vaccine personally, but it puts a lot of risk for them and certain patients in the future. If you get chickenpox as a kid, that is good news. It is more mild and really not as damaging. But as an adult, the pain is unbearable. If you have or someone you are near has AIDS or Immunocompromised you are basically rolling the dice with their lives. I've seen chemo patients get chicken pox, that then turns into really nasty skin infections. And on some occasions the virus affects more than the skin, goes into pretty much every organ and causes them to bleed on the inside. That has about a 70-90% chance of death.\n\nI understand why someone would refuse it. I get it.

A seroconversion of 95% can be seen after one dose and 98% after 2 doses. Other studies have shown about a 2% of vaccinated people will still develop chickenpox after vaccination. A more plausible explanation for the high rate of symptoms is that the second dose of the vaccine if given fell in the study and would have been reported. Additionally it is possible that a 6 week period is not enough to filter out symptoms directly caused by the initial immune response to the vaccine. \n\nThe incidence of shingles was 46 out of 7585 kids in the 14 years of the study or about 0.5 per 1000 person years. Usually the rate of shingles in kids 1-15 years of age is really low or about 1 per 1000 person years. This rate was the same in the US pre-vaccination. This means that the vaccine only halves the risk. Keep in mind that only physician-diagnosed cases were included here so people who had a minor outbreak that did not need medical care or was gone before an appointment was made are not included here. The actual amount of cases will likely by higher making it hard to compare. \n\n[A different paper dealing with the same cohort](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X00002978) tested the strain that caused the herpes zoster (shingles) and found that the majority of testable cases were caused by the vaccine strain.\n\n**Edit:** Crossed out me being an ass, and added the next part:\nShingles in young people is always rare, this is why it is often mentioned as an extremely rare side effect. We just don\u2019t know yet how common it actually is because the period/age where it is more common and an actual comparison can be made is not yet reached by the people vaccinated in 1995.\n\nIn addition to that when more people are vaccinated exogenous boosting will be less and it is possible that that sort of boosting in important to keep lifelong immunity. If do a deep dive into the papers written about the topic you will see that there is a lot of speculation and depending on what factors you take into account the outcome is vastly different. This is also the reason a second dose has been added since the vaccines release.",

[This comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vaxxhappened/comments/bmir4q/who_needs_vaccines/emykdnd) corrects me where I was wrong, for anybody interested. \n\nYes, that's a possibility, albeit an incredibly rare one. If you receive the proper vaccinations as a child, your immune system will be introduced to the weakened, but live, virus. Your immune system then promptly kills it and any future instances of the virus. If you were to develop chicken pox, it would be very mild, but it would open you to the possibility of shingles in later life. As I said however, that is very rare.\n\nI also looked this up and every medicinal or scientific website I found stated that studies have shown that the increase in shingles in the States was unrelated to the varicella vaccine. People are living longer now than ever, which increases the chances of older people contracting shingles. The vaccine has only been around since 1984, after all. I did see a few sites that said the vaccine *does* cause shingles, but they were all natural health websites and were opinion pieces, not studies.\n\n**In summary,** while it's possible for the varicella vaccine to introduce shingles, it's extremely rare. The vaccination prevents 100% of serious cases and 95% of moderate cases of chicken pox. If a person develops a case of the chicken pox after the vaccination, usually mild, then the possibility of shingles is there. This rarely happens. If it does, get the shingles vaccination at the age it is recommended. If it doesn't, then the possibility isn't there, since the immune system killed the virus completely and knows to kill any future instances. Regardless, the shingles vaccination would prevent it anyways.",

The virus responsible for shingles is the same one responsible for chicken pox. When you get over chicken pox as a kid, the virus remains dormant in your nerve tissue. That's why it's uncommon to get chicken pox twice - the virus is still in your system already. If your initial case was mild, you can get it twice because the virus will reactivate and cause the usual severe case. It can still reactivate as shingles later on. \n\nIn most cases, the virus won't reactivate until adulthood, if it reactivates at all. When it reactivates, it causes shingles. If you never got the chicken pox or the chicken pox vaccine, your immune system has no idea what the virus is. Shingles isn't contagious, but the virus is, so in such cases it is possible to get the virus - **not** the condition - from somebody with open blisters from shingles. It's also possible to get it from someone with chicken pox, which is highly contagious. This is how you get chicken pox as an adult, which is much more serious than having it as a kid.\n\nGetting chicken pox as an adult can lead to bad complications, more often in males, and although it is rare for chicken pox to be lethal, the lethal cases are usually adults. That's why the chicken pox vaccine is important for *anybody* who hasn't contracted it yet. The shingles vaccine is also very important because shingles can cause complications such as lifelong chronic nerve pain and blindness, becoming more common with age.\n\n**TL;DR:** The chicken pox and shingles are the same virus, which remains in your system and reactivates as an adult. The chicken pox vaccine is important for anybody who hasn't had the condition and the shingles vaccine is important for everybody.",

I think they need to revisit the guidelines on that one. \n\nI think that the age is higher because they assume younger people got the chicken pox vaccine when they were children. I got chicken pox in 2nd grade and the vaccine wasn't added to the children's vaccination schedule until 1995 so I got it before I could be vaccinated. Most older adults (I'd say over 40) probably didn't get the chicken pox vaccine at all and the rate of chicken pox was pretty high, so that demographic is more likely to end up with shingles and probably have more complications from it due to age. \n\nThat's just a guess though, I'm not any kind of expert on  vaccines or diseases. It's just the only way waiting until that age makes sense to me.",

It is the right wingers and evengelicals who make all the excuses about but muh freedom not the left wingers. The funny part I never really considered myself a left winger. I believe that people who are not religious shouls not have religion imposed on them or to comply with religion because part of living in a secular society means that the rule of law has legal authority not religion because in a secular society religion has no legal authority to control people's lives who are not their particular religion because they are not entitled to the same authority over nonreligious people at all. There's also the argument if who's religion is used when there are multiple religions so it is better to let people live their lives as they see fit and they have authority over their own lives as it should be.\n",

We also can't force crazy people to take anti psychotics even if we feel it would make them functional again because there's no way to fully understand the mental side effects they experience.

There are a lot of well documented examples. The USA govt is absolutely included. These are not conspiracy theories.

Yeah, I can understand limiting access to places if you're not vaccinated. I think they need to look into travel restrictions (gets really fuzzy bc it's so closely tied to religion - I'm atheist but I'm way into protecting personal beliefs bc at the end of the day I have no proof either). Dunno. But we can't get to the point we force people. Just take away options but leave basic education and daycare available (bc it should honestly be infinity more available and free) but isolate it all somehow. Maybe give extra benefits to vaccinated people. Idk I don't know. High level, free, quality education in every possible way would really fix sooooo many things",

It led to more than a few manhunts to jail people without vaccinations, which was always poor people or strangers to an area.\n\nSo the process became cyclical. Outbreaks happen, there is a push to get everyone vaccinated, a generation or so passes and people forget the outbreaks, vaccinations lapse and history repeats itself.

If I drove having had a few glasses of wine I would be charged even if I caused no damage.\n\nThere have been cases where an HIV positive person failed to inform their partner prior to sex - the intent was not to cause infection, but it could have been reasonably foreseen that they posed a high risk and as such should have informed their partner and taken preventative measures - and prosecutions have resulted.\n\nThe law provides for punishment for endangering life - where a reasonable person could see that their actions, while not intended to endanger life, would do so. So if I were not vaccinated then that (of itself) does not endanger life - if I were then to walk into a school, or a shopping centre or an office then I would pose a risk to others, and if I were sick at the time then I'm most certainly and deliberately endangering others.\n\nThe problem is that it's hard to enforce the concept of endangering life through lack of vaccination when dealing with individuals. However, if you allowed organisations to be charged with negligence if they allowed an unvaccinated person to come in to contact with an immuno-compromised person then attitudes might begin to change - particularly if schools and employers began to require a full set of vaccinations (or medical exemption) for fear of being found negligent.\n\n&#x200B;",

Lots of adults who get their normal vaccines refuse to get flu shots because \"It makes me sick\".  So who do you charge every year for these deaths and hospitalizations?  Do you charge the person that they contracted it from or do you charge the parent or will you have cops go to the hospital and arrest the person who was hospitalized from influenza and barely pulled through?\n\nI'm all for everyone getting vaccinated, including influenza which half of this sub won't be vaccinated for this year, but charging someone with murder because a disease tried to kill them, failed and then killed someone else is asinine.

It's also just really hard to push for change at this point. I simply can't afford to be very politically active. That takes time, money, and financially security that I just don't have.\n\nIn terms of the religious fervor, Americans in general are becoming less religious. It's that, as more and more turn away from religion, the ones who haven't have doubled down and they make for a powerful force in politics. \n\nI did not see anything crazy in terms of comments on gun control so I can't speak to that specifically but again, I think the more memorable comments that you saw may be the bad ones and that's why it's sticking with you. Plenty of people in America realize that our gun laws suck. \n\nYou are free to feel however you feel but I just want to challenge you to think about the 90% of good comments you read rather than  the bad 10%.",

The fact that she's trying to say she was told it was religious exemption ought to be a red flag that the story is made up, since it would violate ferpa for the school to say that. More likely, she was only told that someone has pertussis... But, this subs a circle jerk so whatever.\n\nEdit: Also important to note, pertussis vaccination coverage among adults 19 and up in the US is only slightly more than 23%... so 77% of all adults around you at any given time are not immune, and could be infected with something that is frequently asymptomatic in adults. 77% at the grocery store, in the restaurant, at the dog park, etc. People who aren't immune are all around your children all the time. It's up to *you* to protect yourself and your family. One other thing. If this mom was really so concerned about pertussis, she could have taken her child to the doctor and had them do an antibody titer to confirm that her child was immune to pertussis, measles, etc, before signing them up for school. Again, it's a parent's responsibility to ensure their child's safety. You can't ever guarantee what other people do and shouldn't rely on the wider community to be doing what's best for your kids.",

You can find this phenomenon all over reddit and pretty much any other social media platform, and it's inevitable if people with similar interests come together. My advice would be to either ignore it or study neurobiology and come up with a \"cure\" for human tribalism, it would probably benefit us all. :)\n\nYou should also keep in mind that the average person is not scientifically literate enough to back up their claims by citing credible sources, and even if they can do it, they're often too lazy, especially since it's the internet, so nobody really cares.

That is the key part; in vaccinated people.\nThere is nothing wrong with the vaccine but when it comes to infectious diseases it needs to be looked at from a population standpoint.  \n\nThe issue is that chickenpox is worse in adults than in kids. If about half of the population gets vaccinated it will reduce natural chickenpox a lot. This is initially great but after a couple of years there will be enough unvaccinated adults to have an outbreak in the adult population. This brings along more deaths, disability and even disabled kids if the mother got it during pregnancy. Since the original trial it has also been shown that the immunity is possibly not life long as was initially expected and vaccination in kids increases the amount of shingles in people who went trough the disease before vaccines were around. All of this can be solved with more vaccines but this also costs more money. The issue is that not a single country wants to spend this much money on a disease that had a mortality of less then 1/ 100 000 before vaccination. Instead of a reduction in medical costs the vaccine has caused an (temporary?) increase. We just need to wait to see if this is temporary and the issue will sort itself out as the people who were not vaccinated die off over the next 60 years or if this becomes the new norm. It is not known yet and I can see why some people believe the issue will sort itself out. \n\nTo sumarise: there is nothing wrong with the vaccine, just with how it is used. When used to protect adults is has the biggest return on investment looking at the current data but this might be different when looked at over a 50-100 year time-frame. ",

No matter if they are right or they have the (real)science to back it up.\nWe have just become an angry mob that will violently crush anything that is not conform with the perceived \"truth\" that was created. It is just as bad as the people we ridicule. This is not a sub I want to be a part of, if this is a permanent change that means I will be leaving here and I hope that the falsehoods spread will not empower the antivax movement even more. \n\nWe should never define ourselves as just pro-vax. One's stance should originate from the current science and the goal to provide everyone with the safest possible world. From the outside this will mostly be what can be seen as \"pro-vax\" but at its core it is completely different. The right choice for the wrong reason can still be wrong. We should never dismiss facts or science because it doesn't fit \"the narrative\" the science and facts should be the core of what we stand for. Sure there is science that is wrong or faulty, in those cases we should dismiss it for being wrong or faulty, not for the results they found. We should never become an echo chamber trying to drown out the voices that do not share our opinion.\n\nWe need to be above that and be a voice of reason. Not debate around with artificial \"facts\" and scary stories and be just another polarized group without any real merit. We should try to educate people instead of drowning them out. We should learn about the mistakes made by the antivax not copy them. \n\nMy apologies for the rant, I really needed to get this off my chest. Feel free to discuss anything I said here or add to it. Contrary to vaccine safety and disease mortality there are not many facts here and it is an almost pure block of opinion. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit, dammit I messed up the title."

Some had the usual one day fever, some (including me) had barely any symptoms at all. \nMy boyfriend's acquaintance reported to him that their uncle passed 4 days after the vaxx. They didn't report any autopsy reasons tho, just said he couldnt sleep for 4 days. Maybe.... I don't know. And I highly doubt they do either. But a point to make is that this acquaintance was a \"faith healer\", tarot card reader, natural health, spirituality and anti-vaxxer\" all before this event. And in my experience it's always this type of people who know someone who died after the vaccine, and never someone whos been vaccinated themselves. \n\nYou do what you feel comfortable with.

The CDC says, \"Health care providers are required to report to VAERS the following adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination\u2026regardless if the reporter thinks the vaccine caused the AE.\" AE stands for adverse event and includes death.\n\nThat means that if a vaccinated person drowns, gets in a car crash or is struck by lightning, their death must be reported to VAERS as an adverse event. Since we've vaccinated over 140 million people in the United States, many deaths will occur coincidentally after vaccination.\n\nAs of May 10, there have been 4,434 reports of death following a COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS. Doctors at the CDC review each reported death, looking at death certificates, autopsy and medical records. **They have no reason to believe that COVID-19 vaccines cause death.\"**\n\nHypothetically even if say all roughly all 8,000 deaths reported to VAERS were 100% connected to the vaccine, that would make the \"death rate\" 0.01509% if 53 million people are vaccinated.

It's not just limited to western religions.\n\nI've never understood how people can be against medicine, science, or being good stewards of the environment and then say things like \"god works through the hands of men\".  The very root of their arguments are always based around the belief that human beings have no control over anything, have no free will because apparently god has all the control, and that we bare no longer term responsibility for our actions in this life.  Yet most religions claim that whatever the divine power is gave human beings free will and often acts through them.\n\nI don't know how they can use their religious faith as an excuse for inaction, or worse to be destructive to the people and world around them.  That they can somehow believe that them being an irresponsible person and destructive to Gods green Earth, will somehow get them into the promised eternal paradise of an afterlife.",

It's odd but makes sense when you think about it. \n\nI mean if it wasn't for modern medicine I don't know what would have happened to me. Actually, I'd have died shortly after birth so yeah.
