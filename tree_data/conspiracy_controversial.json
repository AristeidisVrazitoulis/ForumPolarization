Treaties are extremely important when it comes to diplomacy, and other than war (last resort), sanctions are the best another country can do to express dissent. So the problem is, is that Russia is not following the system set in place. \n\nI recognize that International Law is soft law. It's not binding, but blantantly (especially being one of the big five in the UN) and deliberately breaking Sovereignty of another nation is the wrong course of action. It's not in the details of what they're doing, it's the larger picture. Russia is a superpower, and it's course of actions have profound effects on other nations.

I mean, if you can't see the hypocrisy of this complaint, there really is no hope.  The US can aim to counter these efforts, but its a bit rich to complain about the interference itself.\n\nThe last two years opened my eyes to the extent western governments are willing to go to control their populations for \"the greater good\".  I hate the current Canadian government.  I can now better understand Russia's view, particularly their reaction to foreign interference in Ukraine in the 2014 coup.\n\nI still think what is happening in the Ukraine is 100% wrong.  As much as I hate the current Canadian government, I don't want foreign interference in our country at all, even if I were to like the outcome, because it could easily go the other way.\n\nI would have been supportive of the western democracies saying to Putin, \"Fine, we will no longer support the Ukraine joining NATO, but if you do ANYTHING to interfere there, all bets are off.\"\n\nPutin has sensed the weakness of the west, which is due mainly to  the duplicity of its own leaders.  We are now reaping what we sowed.  Plus, if we really cared, we'd cut Russia off from SWIFT.

At least Russia lets it's own citizens leave the country if they don't take the vaccine, yet you still CAN'T LEAVE CANADA without this vaccine.\n\nThis from the same guy who activated authoritarian emergency orders a week ago to chase his own citizens out of the capital in a crackdown.\n\nThis from the same guy who graduated from the WEF (World Economic Forum) young global leaders program mentored by notorious globalists Klaus Schwab & George Soros.\n\nThis from the same guy who plunders THOUSANDS in tax money on mountains of booze on his private flights and writes it off as miscellaneous expenses.\n\nI don't know about you...but I find it suspicious that all of Reddit suddenly gets behind the RUSSIA BAD campaign overnight. The front page is now littered with Anti-Russia rhetoric all of a sudden that's the \"popular\" and \"acceptable\" view to hold on this website because it's been given the green light of approval by TPTB (The Powers That Be). May I add that these same Anti-Russia subs like worldnews and politics are EXTREMELY harsh on people unvaccinated for Covid-19 (Yet they will scream about humanity and human rights for the Ukrainians).\n\nIf I've learned anything in my lifetime it's that NATO, UN, WHO, CDC, AIPAC, DAVOS and the hundreds of global mega conglomerates are infiltrated corrupted global organizations that want to take over the world. I  just roll my eyes harder when LITERALLY EVERYONE all of a sudden has a strong opinion and world governments \"all of sudden\" by \"coincidence\" hold hands in lockstep to implement a unified agenda.\n\nThis fishiest thing about this \"pandemic\" was the politically unified response that rolled out at the SAME DAMN TIME. The same time...all together...in lockstep...almost like a fucking agenda...\n\nP.S That doesn't MEAN I'm against Ukraine because I see both sides."

In fact, people seem to refuse to give me that. The UK is reporting no signoficant difference in non-COVID mortality between unvaccinated and vaccinated, so whatever you think is killing people, it doesn't seem to be aware of the vaccination status.\n\nAnd the cancers didn't appear out of nowhere, they came from the two years of diagnostic delays caused by COVID.",

I think that suggests there may be a small outbreak ongoing, COVID representing 10% of deaths seems high to me.\n\nSo, it looks like the vaccine, while still vaguely 'effective', is not holding up, 45/822 versus 78/873, though that's not exactly news to anyone; but there's no sign of accelerated die off in the vaccinated.\n\nEdit:\n\nLooking at the numbers, I think mortality in general is down slightly. I think we expect about 1.2% of the population to die each year, so we should expect to see monthly death figures around ~1000.\n\nThat's a pretty good sign that we're through the worst of this.",

Worse cowardice is the mask wearers. I don\u2019t mean cowards about sickness. I mean cowards about fight and pushing back against tyranny. In the uk, the govt posted that there was no threat from sars-cov2 (not a HCID) and that masks weren\u2019t mandatory (\u2018face coverings\u2019 article in early 2020). Only the awake read it. So we got to go where we wanted by saying \u201cexempt\u201d. It\u2019s illegal to refuse access to people who say (mask) exempt. Plus in the uk, the Govt site says there is no need to \u2018prove\u2019 exemption or have a doctor\u2019s note. Also that merely discomfort is enough to qualify. People don\u2019t read (or print).",

We don't want that, truthfully we want you all safe also. I won't speak for everyone, my personal issue with those that are unvaccinated (and its only a minority of you) is that you have to constantly mock those thar got it, that you have to constantly have this martyr syndrome,  that you think we are all sheep falling in line. You...like those who got vaccinated,  don't actually know the truth of what's really going on, yet we all feed into this forced division. We continue this vs narrative.\n\nI agree, my initial comment was extremely flippant in nature, it expressed a little of my true opinions, but not all of them. \nWe are all individual, we all have different levels of tolerance on what we consider over stepping boundaries.  I did do my own research,  I have always been transparent about how I feel on Covid with anyone I engage with, I did get the two initial shots, I didn't and won't get any more, and that's for my own personal reasons, I didn't see them pushing the vaccines as a huge red flag of government over reach, doesn't mean I would instantly fall in line when told to, I just chose what was right for me.

I just think that it bad fucking parenting. Because there are now 30k deaths associated with this vaccine that does not include children who died in utero because of the shots or babies who died of sids after their mothers got the jab. . It is an interesting question that the OP is asking . Do people who where feeling morally superior just a few months ago now feel remorse do they, like this woman's family gt stuck with their pride. Can't get over how they fell for the sham and you did not. People do not like to be fooled and it will be a good while if ever for some to realize what went down.

I mentioned an unbalanced wealth distribution & people losing their jobs, sure. But it goes smaller than that. An example is in my own family. I was pregnant when the vaccine came out & my husband and I decided to wait on it. We just weren\u2019t comfortable hopping on board right away. The rest of our family immediately got vaccinated, some traveling 3 hours away to get the vaccine before it was readily available at every corner Rite-Aid. From here, we were siloed from family functions, shunned from group chats, not invited to events. They missed my entire pregnancy. (My MIL even went as far as to have a BABY SHOWER for MY DAUGHTER and DID NOT INVITE my husband and I because we were unvaccinated). \n\nWhen I had my baby, my husbands pro-vaccine family (still mad at us about not being vaccinated) did not come to the hospital to celebrate the birth of his first child (and the birth of the first grand child into the family). All because of their pride that we now know was for NOTHING.\n\nAgain, this is a small on the global scale of destruction. But it\u2019s important to share because it\u2019s \u201csmall things\u201d like this, the special moments in peoples lives, the weddings, the babies, the anniversaries, birthdays, holidays - the things we really live for as a humanity, ruined. And for WHAT.\n\nMy husbands family will never get the chance to celebrate his first child again with him at the hospital. That moment in time is ruined - for all of them.\n\nAnd not that I wish regret on them, but I just hope if NOTHING else, this will make them second guess just hopping on board with whatever new \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d comes our way.\n\nI feel bad for all of the families who share similar experiences like this. Big moments ruined over peoples pride.\n\nThis will happen again. What can\u2019t happen again is the way in which the public was so ready and willing to \u201croll up their sleeves\u201d & shun all of those who chose to think for themselves.\n\nThis period in history will always have asterisk next to it.

An echo chamber is no good but people who do nothing but push the driven narrative here and refuse to budge are probably seen just as divisive as people making statements like OP. And while there are definitely other ways to have phrased what OP said, there are certainly some people out there who may still very much have their heads in the sand and hold contempt for the unvaxxed and, though I may not condone it, I can see why some may feel the need to rub it in their faces and think hopefully they may have an ounce of \"wtf was I maybe really lied to and played like a fiddle?\" rather than the opposite. I think it's just important at this point to remain cognizant of the perspective that it's not even really about medical decisions so much as it is (at least perceived by many as) people spreading lies and refusing to even consider anything else. Which comes from both sides and really more or less with the same weight. \"You're unvaxxed, you're killing people, you should have no rights!\" vs \"You're vaxxed, your spreading spike proteins, you are submitting to coercion and the surrender of freedoms to government control\" etc. Feel me? This day and age it can be hard for people to get along but at the end of the day, all we really have are our intentions and most everyone thinks they're trying to do the right thing in the best way that they know how",

So I'd say I was treated disproportionately and I was ostracized by society for the most part for not wearing masks and being \"unvaxxed\". If we never fought for what we believed in and knew was wrong then the world would be a completely different place right now. I'm glad all of this is finally coming to the surface and people are fighting back. \n\nFunny thing about it all is I served in a Healthcare leadership position for many years and what I saw with what occurred and panned out during all of this made me sick to my stomach and completely went against every ethical standard the industry has claimed to be for, transparency and freedom of personal medical choice. To see Healthcare corporatized now and bending the knee to their special interests and investments made me absolutely sick and disgusted in such an industry that has direct influence on everyone's health. Their contradictions and fear proved to me that they can be bought and paid for like any other Joe Schmoe trying to cover their own ass while maintaining their standards of living, even at the expense of everyone else.\n\nIt's actually quite scary and it's the reason why I left Healthcare after 15 years.\n\nIt's not just one hospital you have to worry about, or two or three, or all of them. It's actually the regulatory agencies that fund these hospitals, that have them by the balls. CMS, Joint Commission, OSHA, State Departments of Health. Hospitals have to abide by rules and regulations and if they don't they either have to pay fines or run the risks of being shut down. Since the latter is never the option they are then forced to fall in line and make policy changes to abide by the new standards.\n\nFor example, if CMS came out and stated that in order for a Healthcare facility to receive their Medicaid reimbursements that all the nursing staff need to be vaccinated, you bet your ass that hospital will be developing new regulations and policies making sure this happens. Without CMS funding, which funds like 99% of hospitals in the US, they will eventually collapse.\n\nThis was never about anyone's health. They never cared. You can say you did all this research but you have to question the validity of everything, even research when it comes to this. It was all by design to bring this country to its knees. It was a bigger plan than most want to believe or even understand. The fact we LET the government get to this point as they continue to pump more of our tax dollars into pointless wars and PC bullshit keeps proving to them that we have bent that knee. It's all by design. Sending more of our money to Ukraine, printing more money, destroying the USD, eliminating the middle class, sowing division and hatred towards one another, pointing the finger back to us, buying all of our farmland, telling us we need to stop eating beef and red meat, slowly telling us cannibalism isn't that bad of a choice, same with cricket supplements and eating insects, etc, etc, etc. We can literally tie in any and every current conspiracy to the validity of our own government trying to reduce us into a third world country for the highest bidder at everyone's expense besides those who have something to gain and profit from it all.\n\nBack to my main point, we can sit here and talk about this fucking pandemic and vaccinated this and unvaccinated that BUT these conversations eventually hit a finite wall until you realize this is all a multidisciplinary and multifaceted coup on the world by the ruling oligarchs and they won't give up their power easily. They are going to fight for it all to the death and as long as we keep focusing on only specific tentacles of their plan then they will continue to remain in power. We have to somehow build up the base that allows us all to come together as a species and kick these fuckers out for good. I don't even need to name names, these forums have been riddled with their names and conspiratorial ties for years.\n\nThe common citizen is now waking up to knowing some bullshit is occurring and it wreaks. Most people I talk to irl feel that something is off and things aren't right lately. They are finally starting to question it all and critically think. I truly hope this is an evolution for us all that can lead us into a newfound way of living in some sort of symbiotic utopia. And not the 'utopia' the oligarchs salivate over, either, not their dystopian vision for us all.\n\nSorry for the text wall.",

Look up the definition of a vaccine. It\u2019s there to help generate an immune response. An immune response is never 100% effective. There were breakthrough cases when MMR was still a huge issue due to how wide spread it was. Fortunately through time the vaccine slowed the spread to the point that it is extremely rare. But make no mistake you are never permanently immune. These are most definitely vaccines by definition from the beginning. The idea that a vaccine is just deadened viral dna is wrong. There are other ways to create an immune response in someone. mRNA is next generation vaccination technology whether you agree with it or not. It has proven to be very effective and has saved millions. Breakthrough cases occur in all vaccines, especially when it\u2019s at its peak in the population. But now we see C19 becoming far less of an issue thanks to the vaccines.",

One pilot claimed he cannot fly anymore because of the jabs due to heart issues I believe; he can no longer met the requirements that would allow him to fly. In DC right now, the mayor isn\u2019t allowing unvaccinated students to attend classes physically with no option for remote learning.\n\nAnd they didn\u2019t endanger anybody. They worked all throughout 2020 and were hailed as heroes and undoubtably had natural immunity from coming into close contact with sick people over and over again (which exists despite what the MSM will tell you, and is lifelong and long lasting, our bodies are very much used to coronaviruses they are not a new thing). Soon as the \u2018vaccines\u2019 showed up suddenly they\u2019re incapable of being around patients despite being around them for an entire year with no issues. And then it turns out the shots don\u2019t even work and that the virus wasn\u2019t as dangerous as we were lead to believe. In fact, most people would have been off doing nothing at all than taking these shots.\n\nThe \u201c100% effective\u201d bullshit they spewed when selling the jabs were based on RRR. ARR was less than 1% and that ignores the plethora of adverse reactions people started to have up to and including death.\n\nAnd did anyone think differently? If anyone thought mRNA injections wouldn\u2019t have adverse reactions, they\u2019re insane. That\u2019s why the claim the naysayers made is that they don\u2019t mess with DNA or the like. Yet a respresentative from Bayer the at World Health Summit, compared them to genetic editors with no hesitation and later said if they gave a poll before the pandemic, they would have gotten a 98% rejection rate from the public.\n\nThe pandemic was used to push a whole bunch of other stuff that has absolutely nothing to do with public health.\n\nYou\u2019re gaslighting when you act like the mandates didn\u2019t cost people their jobs. The fucking shots don\u2019t work. They don\u2019t. In fact they weaken your immune system and go into negative efficacy after 3 months. Which explains why the people who get the jabs keep getting sick. The only thing I would say they\u2019re not victims for is if they didn\u2019t get the shots but gave them to others without explaining why they didn\u2019t take them themselves or without even subtly trying to warn them.\n\nBut there are doctors and nurses doing just that now.",

Vaccinated individuals have significantly reduced viral load and shedding, which makes transmitting the disease far less likely. Sure technically you are potentially contagious, but the time frame you would be is reduced along with the viral shedding. Also it has stopped infections, but breakthrough cases can occur. C19 was wide spread and heavily transmitted throughout the population, so breakthrough cases were inevitable. There were even breakthrough cases with MMR back in the day when it first started being used, but over time vaccination reduced the spread of disease which makes the vaccine more effective in the long run. If everyone has a better chance of fighting it, the virus struggles to survive over time. The only reason MMR and Polio isn\u2019t a problem anymore is thanks to vaccine mandates.",

The rates of death from the vaccine are tiny, and your network would need to be millions upon millions to experience that.

Most of these issues are not above the ambient levels pre covid.\n\nThe USA vaccine rate is over 68 percent for their full two dose vaccination, way more than half. The rest of the modern west is much higher and sees vastly better health outcomes. Very early data is actually showing non-covid excess death is higher in the unvaccinated - this is understandable if you consider they have become less likely to seek medical help for cancer and heart issues.\n\nIf you were involved in the medical field you would know that no vaccine in history has shown/manifested negative effects outside of two months.

                  "body": "The unvaccinated are aware of the coercive and manipulative policies. I would think most unvaccinated people know vaccinated people. \n\nI don't want to see people I know and care about get hurt. I get that most people probably thought it was basically the flu shot. The only reason I read so much about the vaccine is the entire lockdown antics and dishonesty. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. \n\nMy boomer friends were the most inclined to see it as sensationalized. I think this might be because Gerald Ford had a sham-demic that cost him the election and tons of public trust in public health. \n\nVast majority of people I went to school with are vaccinated. My college/high school friend group was always like 90%+ liberal. \n\nWhile most Americans know the government lies, they don't think they'd lie about certain things (9/11, pandemics, reasons for war). I understand that perspective, especially among people who always has at least a middle class life or were suburban upbringing to parents paying the down payment with a HELOC loan for a suburban house or condo in a regentrified area. They usually haven't seen the darker side of the world. \n\nThe friends who dealt with things like addiction or broken hearts or legal issues or were in the military always seemed to simply have more common sense and a realistic outlook on the world. They wavered on cynical and nihilistic at times, but the funny thing it the kids who were heroin addicts years ago are now honestly more prepared for a total collpase situation. When you deal with stuff like that, or deal with the legal system, or see death while serving in the military, you understand you're the only one who can save yourself. \n\nPublic defender's don't valiantly argue at trial and save the lost and downtrodden anymore than the welfare department or veterans affairs does. Catch 22 is brilliant in demonstrating how soldiers are treated. \n\nParents want to give their kids a good life. It ends up sheltering a lot of people who never experience \"the real world.\" So I definitely don't blame a lot of people who just assumed the government was telling the truth. \n\nAnd it's not to say people who don't suffer aren't smart or capable. They just lack real world experience.\n\nIt's like Keep the Aspidistra Flying by George Orwell. The guy quits a high paying marketing/ad job to be a writer. Languishes in poverty in a boarding house. Falls in love, has a kid, decides to take the advertising job back and get the ideal middle class life (the Aspidistra is like the white picket fence). \n\nSometimes you have to just suffer a path to pursue something, whether it's truth or knowledge, before you understand what matters in life. There's not time period where you figure out the meaning of life. From grade school to college and then to work. And if you know the world is about more than money or a good career, it feels guilded and empty. \n\nWhen you know the American dream of a nice house and two cars and a fancy job title isn't what you want, and that what you crave can't be bought, you are in conflict with the ethos of our society. You can either put on a mask and lockstep like the kids on the conveyor belt in We Don't Need No Education, or you have to suffer to find what you seek. \n\nBecause nothing worth having comes easy and you can't find meaning without real experiences. So many people are alienated and we all need to be more empathetic. \n\nThe vaccinated are victims. And that's a real trauma we will have to address in a loving manner so we can heal. Alienating victims is not an act of love or path to healing. \n\nAs Roger Waters said: tear down the wall. We have chosen to build that which divides us. We're all guilty of doing this intentionally or unintentionally. And that's okay. We just have to accept that we played a role and choose to act differently. We must lead by example. And each act of love can change the course of human history. \n\nHanging the Nazis didn't end the problem of Nazism. Because humans keep choosing to do evil. The only way to defeat evil is with love. Not with evil. Hate is evil. And alienating victims is an act of hate.",

Most conservatives lives revolve around their morals, beliefs, and just their their overall values which all affect their quality of life. Now those things that I mentioned are all static. They don't change. We decide what we think is best for us, our families, our communities, our states, and the country that we love. When an issue pops up we don't change our beliefs, morals, values, or stances. That's why the one thing that the left n3ver says about us is that we are hypocrites. Now alot of democrats and the vast amount libs have no morals, beliefs, and values so their stance sways back and forth depending on what issues they choose to support or vilify. My example is HOW THE FUCK can you chant \"my body my choice\" for 40 years while demanding that women keep their right to bodily autonomy... Only to reverse their stance for 3 years to vilify women who demanded that \"my body my choice\" protect their right to bodily autonomy and refuse to get injected with an experimental \"vaccine\" that doesn't even prevent contraction... Only to reverse their stance again to start chanting \"my body my choice\" all over again like they didn't forget that phrase was buried for 3 years? You can't question the results of The 2020 election yet Hillary Clinton is still claiming that Donald Trump stole the election from her in 2016(which was definitively proven false), and Democrats are already questioning the the results of The 2022 midterms if there happens ro be a res wave. Democrats have been \"the champions of marginalized communities\" and pushed women's rights... Now they can't even define what a woman is and push men into completely dominating women's sports. They also claim that they are fighting racism and striving for equality... Yet The Minneapolis School District created a policy where white teachers will be fired before less represented races which clearly violates Titles 6 & 7 of The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and is clearly fucking racist. All they do is pick a cause that they think will get them votes and if it blows up in their faces just pretend that it never happened and jump on the next flavor of the week and push it to the media that hypnotizes their viewers by talking about nothing else non stop 24/7",

We all had the same opportunity to research the \"pandemic\", yet some people accepted that anything less than N95s were fucking pointless and why risk taking an experimental \"vaccine\" that doesn't prevent catching covid when you could simply and safely take an Airbone capsule, supplemental Vitamin C, and go out for some vitamin d everyday to accomplish the only benefit of the \"vaccine\". I also find it fucking hilarious that being unvaxxed/unmasked and working directly with dirty ass motherfuckers I haven't caught covid and 1000s if not millions of fully vaccinated and boosted people wearing masks have caught covid 2 or more times. Ya us \"conspiracy theorists\" and misinformation spreaders researched instead of believing whatever we were told knew that unvaccinated people actually had better immunity than the vaccinated. Oh...

First several months we didn't even have a way to test for it...just note symptoms, then Boom - now we are having mandatory employee testing every 2 weeks, then They/Co Suits held a conference to convince us to get the brand new vaxx (My Co decided to go with Pfizer) which would be paid for by the facility (yours free if only you comply to take the risk - do it for the Co, do it for America lol anyways), the conference was held by of all people - one of my favorite doctors that rounds our facility and also works hospitals as well, He being my favorite doctor with his laid back, calm demeanor...he made a couple jokes - ya he was almost convincing...\n\nFortunately, my facility decided that the vaccines would Not be Mandatory (for ethical reasons and especially after a coworker died of a heart attack & respiratory distress just 1 week after getting the vaccine - he also had predisposing health issues on top so that didn't help either). So I don't have to worry about losing my job for refusing to get vaxxed yay.\n\nHowever, they certainly had their ways of \"punishing\" & \"coercing\" us nay-sayers to get vaxxed:\n1. Anyone who was Unvaxxed & came down with CV19 would no longer be able to use PTO for their sick days out.\n2. Mandatory Employee Testing for the virus was bumped up to a dreadfully annoying 2xs a week! So many wasted tests.\n3. This is a given but everyone in the building was required to wear N95s all day every day - even kitchen staff who never leave the kitchen - regardless of whether the nurse or cna is working on the locked down/walled off Covid unit or not... \n4. Speaking of masks, they even went so far as to remove our tables outside in the smoke break area so we couldn't sit and also they posted a 2 person limit on the patio and said we had to stand 6 ft apart diagonal from each other - and be sure to blow our smoke through the screens to the outside, not in the patio - that made break time Hella awkward.\n\nIn Conclusion:\nLong story short no I did not buckle down and get vaxxed, I even worked the CV unit on several occasions and never caught it (just popped a lot of vitamins & complied with the PPE gear) but They damn sure tried to get me vaxxed. The little petty \"rules\"/\"punishments\" were so ridiculous, almost comical but I swear they are true. \n\nSo basically it was pretty ironic in the end that overall the so called rights for the vaxxed vs unvaxxed was pretty much the same except for the PTO discrepancy if one fell ill. No one lost their jobs and there was by the Co higher ups a very hush hush CYA policy to protect all employees so we can all still work regardless of vaxx/or unvaxx statuses.",

And my only comment to reply to conjecture was the fact that it takes good several years in order to have a reliable safe vax that would even work, safely, and proper. And I praise those in that field of work that puts in the hard work of actually studying this sort of medical subject given there medical professional they worked many years in very working hard manner. And you and anyone to say otherwise that whatever was whooped up in some half ass cash grabbed an more so unsafe dangerous conglomerate mass of so called health shot to save life's was sadly mistaken.\n\n Well didn't say it so rudely, but it might as well to get the point across. Like my gosh people have some common sense. Like in all reality would they even make such a healthy junk vax shot for our benefits is not for me or most to say. For the fact as I just briefly stated only takes those who study the damn thing has any real idea what the F*** goes on medically? And I for one, don't trust anything from most medical professionals. I do honor those fast having life saving ER doctors who are actually out there saving life's. Thank you to those!",

I even said they're gonna flip it and make unvaxxed people think they were right all along and dammit they did!\n\nNo, they can't get rid of everybody then they couldn't have the wealth and power they thrive off of. It's only non-valued people they want to eradicate. The people they consider valuable are advantageous for society in their wicked minds.\n\nYou see, they needed to work hard to get people vaccinated. You can't go to war with untrained soldiers. Get em trained and weaponized is the name of the game and just like war is a billion dollar business,  narcissists/sociopaths benefit from a monetary standpoint with the vaccinations. And just like war, they can execute their plans for culling those they want out of the way. They always make sure It's a win win situation for them.\n\nThere's a lot of parallels to it all. Those who are vaccinated are like the smallpox blankets Europeans deliberately passed out to Native Americans. Once Native Americans were out of the way, the narcissists/sociopaths benefited financially through land and power etc.\n\nI actually cant believe nobody has ever wondered why Native Americans were decimated by smallpox yet African slaves weren't, despite the fact they were an equally virgin population with no exposure to smallpox. \n\nWhat African slaves did is inoculated each other by cutting themselves and mixing their blood. That's what kept them from being decimated by smallpox like Native Americans but to be fair, African slaves also weren't the target population either. They were needed to line the pockets of narcissists/sociopaths.\n\nEverybody I've known that's vaccinated has never caught Covid except my sister's neighbor and he said his symptoms were very mild compared to unvaxxed people who caught it. Now what's disturbing is he possibly and unknowingly passed it on to an unvaxxed young woman who lived two houses down and she died. Can't say I was surprised because like I mentioned, I called it at the very beginning. \n\nThe thing is, the symptoms and problems she developed hit her major organs and mimicked everything but Covid. We're talking about a healthy, fit, lean young lady. Covid does something strange to your blood. It causes disappearing blood clots that are extremely difficult for specialized diagnostic tests to catch and it wrecks havoc on your organs.\n\nOne of my neighbors is a RN nurse and about a month ago we ran into each other out walking our dogs. I mentioned to her that I'm glad to see things getting back to normal. She nearly had a heart attack when I said that! \n\nShe said a shit ton of unvaxxed people are constantly in the hospital dying left and right. I was like wtf...why aren't we hearing anything  about this???? She said for whatever reason, the hospital's administration instructed staff not to talk about it due to confidentiality and privacy issues. I was like....I knew it. I knew it! \n\nThis is all carefully orchestrated by narcissists/sociopaths in power. I have a background in Clinical Psychology/Behavioral Science and I know their sinister tactics very well. \n\nWith the exception of narcissists/sociopaths/psychopaths that are serial killers, one thing they're good at doing is killing without directly killing. \n\nLook at history....at monarchs, emporers, Hitler, Stalin, Mao and other sociopaths in power etc. They didn't do the actual killing themselves. In the case of monarchs and emporers, they had knights, samurais doing the killing for them. This is what I mean about weaponizing the vaxxed to take out the unvaxxed.\n\nIt's the same tactic where knights, samurais were used to kill those that narcissists/sociopaths deemed unworthy to live.\n\nEven though I'm vaxxed, I'll be damned if I'll allow myself to be used as a vessel to cull people whom these evil narcissists/sociopaths deem as unwanted garbage. So I still wear my mask everywhere I go. Screw em and their little shitty, evil tactics!",

After the vaccine, I thought surely I have immunity in some form. *Nope*, got COVID a week ago and it did pass easily. The fact that it still happened and the vaccine did not prevent it- I mean, the vaccine shouldn't have been released so early. It was incomplete and now it's worthless because of the mutations. Now I have risks of blood clotting and fucking sudden adult death syndrome. All I wanted was to be protected. I do feel duped, but that doesn't mean you weren't as well. We should be standing together, the division only makes this worse.\n\nI hope everyone can see that apart we are weak. These tiny jabs at one another are only compounding the real problem.

As mRNA is genetic material, mRNA vaccines can be looked at as a genetic-based therapy, but they are classified as vaccines and are not designed to alter your genes,\u201d said Dr Adam Taylor, a virologist and research fellow at the Menzies Health Institute, Queensland, Griffith University.\n\n\u201cGene therapy, in the classical sense, involves making deliberate changes to a patient\u2019s DNA in order to treat or cure them. mRNA vaccines will not enter a cell\u2019s nucleus that houses your DNA genome. There is zero risk of these vaccines integrating into our own genome or altering our genetic makeup.\u201d\nIt\u2019s still remarkable to me that after all this time people haven\u2019t done the research to even fine this basic information.

You believe you're more educated and civilised than the dumb fuck great unwashed who didn't vaxx up like you and your dinner party pals.\n\nClass hatred isn't \"cool\" or sophisticated and you can *try* to disguise it as a defence of \"science\" or a moral stand. It's still just snobbery and class hatred.",

                      "data": {
                        "body": "There's actually a ton of data that working age people, of unspecified vaccine status, are dying off at a rate up to 40% above baseline. The increases in (non-covid) excess deaths are through the roof since 2021.\n\nNow we don't have a clear picture of  vaccine status breakdown for this data, but we do have the data. *Something* happened in 2021 that has caused this.\n\nMy own opinion? It's the spike protein. There is so much research that has demonstrated its toxicity. Nearly everyone on the planet has been exposed to the toxin by now, one way or another. The issue with all toxins is dosage. The more dose you get, the more often you get  it, the more risk is posed to your health.\n\nNow most of us here, vaxxed or unvaxxed, have had covid by now. If you've got some immunity - by any route - further exposures should result in either no infection or milder infection. Immunity wanes over time. There does seem to be evidence that vaxxed immunity wanes faster, so that's one issue to take into account. However, if you've had an infection after vaccination, that will top up your immunity too.\n\nBottom line - most of us now, regardless of vaxx status have some immunity to covid. That means that future exposures to the virus should be mitigated by immune response, there will be less viral replication, and importantly, less production of spike protein as a result.\n\nOk, so that's the situation with infection. We continue to be exposed to the toxic protein, but hopefully to a much lesser degree over time.\n\nNow the situation with the vaxx is up to you. If you've taken it once, twice or three times, that's a lot of exposure. The mRNA in each vaccine dose is active much longer than initially claimed and the spike is manufactured at a much larger dose in the body than is typical in the case of infection. The nano lipid particles, unlike the virus, can enter any cell in the body, so the distribution of the toxin is also likely to be considerably wider. There is pharmacokinetic  data which supports this hypothesis.\n\nBut now here's the good news -  you can stop right there.\n\nRepeated boosting is about the most insane thing anyone could do at this point. Us \"anti-vaxxers\" have never thought the vaxx was effective, but even if you are vaxxed, it should have become apparent to you by now that it doesn't stop infection or transmission, and with omicron especially, you don't really have to worry much about hospitalisation or death, unless you are already significantly weakened by another illness or are over 80 years old.  Data is now starting to come out showing that all cause mortality is higher in the vaccinated in the period after vaccination compared to the rate for unvaccinated people of the same age, so there's that as well.\n\nThe take-away message if you've studied this thing is this:\n\nMINIMISE EXPOSURE TO THE SPIKE.\n\nIf you're unvaxxed, that's great, especially if you've already had covid and have some immunity that way. If you're young, healthy and vaxxed, you're probably going to be fine too,  but you gotta stop it now. Putting your body through further exposures to high doses of the spike is unnecessary and unwise. Data is showing that spike effects, as per the effects of other poisons, are cumulative. If you were to \"refresh\" your vaxx every 3 or 4 months as some countries are advising, you would literally never clear your body of spike protein. By the time you're starting to clear it after the last dose, you're getting a booster and topping those toxin levels right back up. That is not going to be a good habit to get into. Quit while you still can.\n\nEDIT: Lol. Here I have made a moderate comment, with no wild or extreme claims, and a measured message  which can be summarised as: \"Most people will be ok, but you should stop exposing yourself to toxins produced by the boosters or you will be putting yourself at unnecessary risk for a viral variant that is currently mild.\"  Everything I've said can be backed up by evidence, which an intelligent and dilgent  web search will yield, despite the skewed results of major search engines.\n\nI'm not going to dig out the references for a bunch of shills who won't read them anyway. As I said, it's a moderate comment. The downvotes are evidence, if anyone needed it, of the sheer desperation at this point of  pharma shills and scared vaccinees in the denial stage of vaccine regret. (The latter are all too obviously looking for scapegoats on to which they can project their anxiety about having been tricked into a bad decision by the former.)",

In fact, this LICENSE to be a HEALTH PRACTITIONER pretty much gives you carte fucking blanche to dictate who and who is not informed....  \n\nHey but good for you, you almost made it to being a doctor... almost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades though. \n\n**AD-Hominem^2*Sarcasm**",

It's refreshing to see someone other than myself able to reiterate this distinction clearly. \n\nBut I want to help you appreciate just how *insidious* this error is.\n\nVaccinations are the result of a process... that has inherent probabilities of failure at each step.  Those probabilities combine to eventually give a probability of dangerous contamination per dose - which is a non-zero number.  They also combine to give a probability of ineffective dose.\n\nIf this probability is .01%, meaning the vaccine is 99.99% effective and safe - and 100 million doses are deployed over a given time frame - 10,000 children will get an ineffective or dangerous vaccine.  \n\nIn the development of this product, a binary event of .01% probability will first exhibit on average by 10,000 trials (E = 1/p).  This means our vaccine would have to be tested on 10,000 people - for there to be a 50% chance a contamination event was observed. \n\nNone of our current biological systems, from vaccines, to medicines, to certain foods.... none of them can be tested to reveal low-probability events that only reveal themselves at trials on a greater order of magnitude. \n\nSome will go the path of vaccination, and some will not.  Both are equally supported in my opinion to suspect both paths are reasonable.  So it is into the great unknown we as a society venture through the darkness.

See, we still see problems with this idea of replication. For example, the FDA requires 3 studies showing that a drug is better than placebo (among other requirements) before it can be approved as a drug. This suggests that the data has been replicated.\n\nHowever, someone can run as many trials as they want, hiding all the trials which showed no difference, and only publish the ones that, by sheer chance, show a positive result. In the research community, 1 in 20 trials of placebo vs placebo will yield a \"statistically significant\" difference. Not to mention that nocebos (placebos with adverse effects) have a stronger placebo effect. Meaning, I can make a useless drug that makes you feel sick and it will often show a statistical benefit over standard placebo. Doesn't matter what the disease is.\n\nWelcome to the drug scam.\n\nIt isn't until decades later when several independent researchers, who, as you have suggested, managed to successfully produce and publish the true negative results (which is difficult due to inadequate funding and publication bias - ie journal editors are less likely to publish studies with negative results) are able to compile enough published studies to create a meta-analysis that has a definitive answer.\n\nCoincidentally by that point, the drug patents have usually run out and drug companies are no longer interested in defending the drug. They've already moved on to market some other shiny pill with a sexy name.\n\nWe are seeing this corruption in action right now with many cholesterol lowering drugs like ezetimibe, and diabetic drugs like the sulfonylureas.",

God grief no that is exactly what it is NOT.  \n\nFormal peer review as recognised by mainstream science is, essentially, a highly critical & almost destructive process.   \nWhich is what it should be: if your research survives proper peer review, its good science  (you can have good science with out peer review, or course, but if you want it published in a reputable journal it will be subjected to pr.)  \n\nExperts in the field your research paper is in (and the techniques it has employed) are selected by the journal that is considering publication..and they will thoroughly review your paper and look for weakness i.e. bad science: anything that means your conclusions are invalid, or too-great-a-leap from your results.  \nThen they'll make recommendations, query your approach. Suggest ways to improve the paper so that the journal isnt embarrassed by publishing a shitty paper(reputations are fragile).    \n(note that the peers and the authoring scientist wouldnt communicate directly: the peers are anonymous, and independent/anonymous to each other).   \n\nThey pick holes in your work.\n\n\n-Then the journal can accept and publish (if the criticism are minor, but the reviewers agree that the science is good. Note there are ALWAYS criticisms. Peer review can be a tough process for someone who is not used to it).    \n\n-Or reject it..until the authoring scientist can e.g. improve the research or clarify anything that may simply be badly written (but was actually perfectly good science)  \n\n  \nIts not perfect of course, and mistakes can be made: the reviewers are human & only have the paper they are given and must assume that it faithfully represents actually conducted work.   \nBut the more well known sorts of mistakes tend to be due to:  \n-outright lying about the research (e.g. Andrew wakefield; that japanese guy who said he cloned a human)  \n\n-collusion with an editor of the journal to publish bad science deliberately: this is how creationists managed to get an ID paper in a leading journal (somrhting that journal had to do a lot of explaining to recover their damaged reputation).\n  \nBut for the most part...very much the most part, it works. And when it fails: its actually a continuation of the scientific review process that leads to uncovering the problem. This usually happens when other researchers cannot understand why they cannot reproduce the same results.  \n\nSo, no...Peer Review is NOT like getting some people on the internet to proof read.  \n\nAnd while I am on the subject: reputable journals with good scientific research are looking out for good science that will reinforce their reputation. You would never have to pay such a journal to publish your good science. gold is in demand.  \nShitty science can (usually) only get published if you pay someone to do so.  e.g. Jones/Harrits 9/11 related thermite paper.  (which was NOT properly peer reviewed: you can tell by reading it). The journals that need paying to publish something dont really have many scientists wanting to have their publication.\n  \n",

Pretty sure what i linked to above illustrates quite clearly HIV was not \"silently snaking around\" in the 1970s. It shows FIV, which does in fact snake around. But with HIV the same genetic strain teleports across the planet and simultaneously starts 9 different outbreaks across the planet. Nothing was snaking. It exploded.\n\n>  Hilleman devised a multistep process to purify this blood so that only the hepatitis B surface proteins remained. Every known virus was killed by this process, and Hilleman was confident that the vaccine was safe.\n\nWas it now? To claim to kill every known virus is pretty much nonsense scientifically. This was blood from a hybrid population of gay men with chronic hepatitis that slowly degraded their livers and immune system. As a result of this weakened immune system the blood that this was manufactured from was often coinfected with a whole slew of pathogens that thrived in human blood.\n\nBasically they took blood from the most chronically diseased people -  blood teeming with diseases that could not be cleared by the immune system - mixed it up... let hilleman throw some bleach on it, and turned around and injected it right back into 600 gay men. The vaccine trial doctors then observed a significant rise in patients with chronic hepatitis infections. \n\nLets keep in mind, we just need one vial that a step was missed on... and we've injected several hundred people with the most gnarly concoction of diseased blood ever made.   And thats exactly what our people begin to present with a year later.... the most gnarly simultaneous infections of diseases hardly seen.\n\n> But, as ghoulish as it might seem to manufacture a vaccine from purified blood, it was determined to have indeed been free of HIV. The purification process had destroyed all viruses \u2014 including HIV.\n\n35 million doses is a lot of doses to have absolute knowledge of.  And considering the tests illustrating the presence of virus were nothing more than arbitrary thresholds of certain protein weights in a culture of blood.... And considering each batch could be made from a completely different beast of potential pathogens.... To claim absolutely there was nothing wrong with this vaccine.... just shows me how little you understand the variability and randomness of the process involved. \n\nThese men were gambling with disease.\n\n> Reason why HBV vaccine was given to gay men was becasue they were at the highest risk for it.\n\nWere they?  Sure the guys at Merck and the NIH were actively funding several scientists to publish papers that said this.... but no one was going wait a minute - gay had nothing to do with this, there were tons of bisexual men in san francisco in that time - and yet there was no propaganda illustrating how prevalent and widespread general fucking was. If there was a widespread rise in hepatitis in san francisco... then the female populations should have also shown evidence of it to some degree. But no one was paying for scientific papers that said that....  \n\nThere was no propaganda illustrating that disease does not target a vague sexual identity - it targets human cells... men.. women.. children. \n\n> This allows the yeast to produce only the noninfectious surface protein, without any danger of introducing actual viral DNA into the final product.\n\nI like how this source tells you how certain hillimans HbV wasn't contaminated, and then illustrates it was changed to mitigate a big risk of contamination.\n\nBig difference in my original post and your response... mine had primary sources... actual scientific data.... and yours is a Planned Parenthood blogpost. \n\n**Grade: F**",

He learned that several HIV sequences had become available, and he encouraged his daughter to take a look at them for a science fair project.  Through this **serendipitous event** , he took a close look at HIV sequence alignments, and was struck by the extent of the genetic differences between the earliest US/French HIV isolates and African HIV isolates. He understood immediately that this was an extraordinary virus.](http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/mary-ann-liebert/aids-research-pioneer-gerry-myers-dies-2GIgq2WC7J)\n\nWhen you talk to Dr Foley it becomes clear he communicates in subtext. This obituary is full of it.  I will point out what he is subversively referencing below as continue my critique of the research on the topic.\n\n>Beginning in the early 1980s, simultaneous outbreaks of Kaposi sarcoma and serious opportunistic infections (later associated with AIDS) were reported[2] among homosexual men, especially in New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. This time span coincides with the average incubation period between HIV infections and the development of AIDS.\n\nOh you touch on it so closely, but don't give the coverage it deserves. \n\nSimultaneous outbreaks, in a very specific sub culture, in two very specific cities at a very specific time. We had a very abnormal medical event happening on both sides of the country that only affected people that identified as \"gay\". This wasn't a slightly elevated incidence in self identified \"gay\". We're not talking like oh it was 60% gays and 20% women and 20% straight men... Were talking 99% gays. No biological agent can accomplish that initial 4 years through natural evolution and transmission. \n\nThe culprit is pretty poorly hidden.\n\n> Dr. Michele Carbone openly acknowledged HIV/AIDS was spread by the hepatitis B vaccine produced by Merck & Co. during the early 1970s.[11] \n\nAgain, you've made yet another error and omission. First, the programs you are referring were the LATE 1970s. [Second, this vaccine program was a trial, that was marketed only to GAY MEN.](http://www.rense.com/1.imagesH/broch.jpg) And third, this trial took place SIMULTANEOUSLY, in NEW YORK and SAN FRANCISCO.\n\nAnd this is where Dr. Foley's subtext becomes crystal clear\n\n> He was among the first people to fully realize the implications of HIV diversity **[in that there was none]** grasping immediately that this virus was going to present a great challenge for vaccine design **[because it was caused by one]**\n\n[We actually have a pretty lengthy and damning interview from the Doctor that ran the San Francisco cohort of this vaccine program about what the program did, what it observed, and how it was affected by the AIDS outbreak.](http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt30000449;NAAN=13030&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=d0e969&toc.depth=1&toc.id=d0e969&brand=calisphere)  \n\nIn this interview, he catalogs how after giving the vaccine to a small group of the gay community, they began to observe a steady increase in the incidence of chronic hepatitis. He catalogs how the vaccine was made from the blood of men which chronic hepatitis.  Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver... which is the most important organ of the immune system. \n\n> Beginning in the early 1980s, simultaneous outbreaks of Kaposi sarcoma and serious opportunistic infections (later associated with AIDS) were reported[2] among homosexual men, especially in New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. This time span coincides with the average incubation period between HIV infections and the development of AIDS.\n\nThis HIV to AIDS theory means something would have had to go around and simultaneously \"HIV'd\" a shit load of gay men in new york and san francisco, in the EARLY 1970s.... and then through some miracle of nature... the virus remained, largely unevolved, in New York and San Francisco.. for a decade.... silently spreading to infect a significant chunk of gay men in these two cities, but very few others. 10 years of natural human being movement, and somehow 90% of the infected stayed in the same city and sub culture...  \n\nSee how that single cause simply falls apart under analysis. What makes more sense is that the vaccination program, that occured in these two cities, in gay men, 2 years before, that observed an increase in hepatitis after they distributed the \"vaccine\" ......  actually injected something into these people that rapidly spread and destroyed the communities in which it was introduced - and then continued to spread outside of that. HIV makes a clear evolution from solely gays of New York and San Francisco to women and the rest of the planet over the next 10 years. \n\nHe then talks about how this program was the first thing the CDC investigated as the AIDS outbreak began. \n\nThe director of the vaccine study chronicles how he was provided funding by the CDC to follow up with his cohort shortly after the start of the outbreak. He talks about the secrecy involved with the patients identities - and how he couldn't find a lot of them. \n\n> In 1982, the CDC concluded that such outbreaks \u201cstrongly suggests the occurrence of a single epidemic of underlying immunosuppression....\u201d The next year, HIV was identified as the causative agent.\n\nAnd he talks about how the CDC only funded a few of this half-ass studies from him before putting all its money behind Robert Gallo's HIV theory of AIDS. No conclusions or papers or audits or analysis or peer reviews were ever done of the data he supposedly collected about the cohort he \"vaccinated\".\n\nBeing the diligent scientist he was, he formed a sound scientific basis for the coincidence of the vaccine programs and the outbreak.... serendipity\n\n>Some people have said that even the hepatitis study was all a big front for something else that was going on on an even larger level than we realized.... I really do think it was **serendipity** that we were doing the hepatitis B trials at the same time that the AIDS epidemic broke.\n\nAgain, Dr. Foley's mastery of subtext shines to the informed. \n\n> Through this **serendipitous event [making a refernce to the \"serendipity\" cause of AIDS presented by the vaccination program director]** , he took a close look at HIV sequence alignments, and was struck by the extent of the genetic differences between the earliest US/French HIV isolates and African HIV isolates **[The extent of genetic differences was non-existant as he points out in his last paper.]** He understood immediately that this was an extraordinary virus **[ In that it was created and spread through vaccines that may or may not have been purposefully contaminated by the biological weapons entity of the government weapons-laboratory network he worked for. ]**\n\nAt this point I would like to share Dr. Foley's first words to me in a forum conveniently destroyed from the public record...  Emory University offered a Coursera course on AIDS... Myself and another person took to the forums to begin posing some of the questions about the science and the history.  Much to my suprise, Dr. Foley responded to a post I made in the forms.\n\nIt started \"sorting information from misinformation is an important exercise\".  Like I said he is a master of subtext.\n\n---\n\nWhile the OPV hypothesis, the green monkey hypothesis, the military pathogen hypothesis, maurice hilleman was a lone wolf actor.... all are intriguing on some level.... they will always be heresay and conspiracy theory.... And they all direct your attention away from what happened in 1978-79 when **serendipity** began to systematically cull the gay populations in New York and San Francisco.\n\n",

The mistake lies in the assumption that high percentages of the population are *still* immune to diphtheria, smallpox, pertussis, etc.\n\n>The problem with this is that most of the protection afforded by these childhood vaccines waned many decades ago, so that most baby boomers, the largest percentage of the population, have *no* protection. In fact, vaccines for most Americans declined to non-protective levels within 5 to 10 years of the vaccines.\n\n>*This means that for a majority of Americans, as well as others in the developed world, herd immunity doesn't exist and hasn't for over 60 years.* \n\nThe media and vaccine enthusiasts would have us believe otherwise, like claiming that as many as 40,000 people die from the \u201cflu\u201d every year, despite this claim being completely unsupported by the data.\n\nIn fact, Peter Doshi, Ph.D., a Johns Hopkins scientist, recently issued a [blistering report](http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f6770), claiming that only a small portion of those diagnosed with the \u201cflu\u201d *actually* have the influenza virus present.\n\n>Promoting influenza vaccines is one of the most visible and aggressive public health policies in the United States, [says Doshi](http://www.newsmaxhealth.com/Headline/influenza-virus-flu-vaccine-Peter-Doshi-Ph-D-/2013/05/16/id/504942/) of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Drug companies and public officials press for widespread vaccination each fall, offering vaccinations in drugstores and supermarkets. \n\n>The results have been phenomenal. Only 20 years ago, 32 million doses of influenza vaccine were available in the United States on an annual basis. Today, the total has skyrocketed to 135 million doses. Mandatory vaccination polices have been enacted, often in healthcare facilities, forcing some people to take the vaccine under threat of losing their jobs. \n\nAccording to Doshi, \u201cThe vaccine may be less beneficial and less safe than has been claimed, and the threat of influenza seems to be overstated. For most people, and possibly most doctors, officials need only claim that vaccines save lives, and it is assumed there must be solid research behind it.\u201d That's not the case, he says.\n\n>Although the CDC implies that flu vaccines are safe and there's no need to weigh benefits against risk, Doshi disagrees. He points to [an Australian study](http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c2994) that found 1 in every 110 children under the age of 5 had convulsions following vaccinations in 2009 for H1N1 influenza. Additional investigations found that the H1N1 vaccine was also associated with a spike in cases of narcolepsy among adolescents.\n\nHopefully, the latest [Tamiflu](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/10/1397164137582/Ben-Jennings-11.04.2014-003.jpg) debacle will help reignite this crucial conversation.\n\nAnother method of the pro-vaccine scare campaign is to evoke mortality rates in the thousands or millions from previous eras or Third World nations. \n\n>If they send out warnings through the media that tens of thousands of infants may die of measles if children (and adults) are not vaccinated each year, it has a major impact on parental decisions to vaccinate.\n\nOne of the most common themes among proponents of the flu vaccine is that everything must be done to prevent the 1917-1918 flu epidemic that killed millions. \n\nHowever, [recent research](http://phys.org/news173715307.html) raises serious doubts about blaming a \u201cwild\u201d strain of the influenza virus for the extraordinary number of deaths. Evidence suggests it was none other than Bayer's indefatigable promotion of aspirin that may have been largely responsible.\n\n>The hypothesis...is that aspirin contributed to the incidence and severity of viral pathology, bacterial infection, and death, because physicians of the day were unaware that the regimens (8.0\u201331.2 g per day) produce levels associated with hyperventilation and pulmonary edema in 33% and 3% of recipients, respectively.\n\nBefore the mortality rate spiked, Bayer embarked on an aggressive ad campaign to promote their new product. Furthermore, autopsy reports from 1918 are consistent with what we know today about the dangers of aspirin toxicity.\n\n>The motivation behind the improper use of aspirin is a cautionary tale, said author Karen Starko, MD. In 1918, physicians did not fully understand either the dosing or pharmacology of aspirin, yet they were willing to recommend it. Its use was promoted by the drug industry, endorsed by doctors wanting to \u201cdo something,\u201d and accepted by families and institutions desperate for hope. \n\nAnother terrifying epidemic in American history was the [1916 polio outbreak](http://htmlimg3.scribdassets.com/8425i20p4w258wzf/images/9-7e65fb9cad.jpg) that killed at least 5,000 people. As can be seen by this graph, the 1916 death rate from polio was extremely anomalous, and was one of the many events that inspired the push to develop a polio vaccine when rates began rising again in the 1940s and 50s. \n\nAlthough originally blamed on \u201cItalian immigrants,\u201d this explanation is beginning to be seriously called into question. [A study](http://www.benthamscience.com/open/tovacj/articles/V004/13TOVACJ.pdf) was published by H.V. Wyatt in 2011 that suggests a much more sinister explanation for the outbreak:\n\n>Previous accounts of the 1916 devastating epidemic have been faulty. The unique features of the epidemic and its sudden appearance have never been explained.\n\n>Three miles from the epicenter of the outbreak, Simon Flexner and his associates at the Rockefeller Institute at 63rd Street and York Avenue, near Queensborough Bridge on Manhattan Island, had been passaging spinal cord tissue containing poliovirus, from one Rhesus monkey spinal cord to another. \n\n>I propose that highly virulent virus escaped and caused the epidemic. Scientists, technical and animal house staff were unaware that they could be infected by poliovirus which could then infect others.\n\nIt seems it would be premature to completely dismiss this hypothesis, especially since an extremely virulent multi-virus (MV) strain of polio was being experimented on within walking distance of the worst polio outbreak in half a century. Mortality rates reached 25% among those afflicted, compared to the usual mortality rate of less than 1%.\n\nThese past events and their \u201cofficial\u201d explanations are extremely important to reanalyze, because they could potentially be used to mislead the public.",

These are meant to powerfully stimulate the body's immune system and include toxic metals like aluminum and mercury, animal proteins, and \u201cspecial lipids.\u201d\n\n>Adjuvants can cause powerful stimulation of the immune system for as long as two years, which means the brain's immune system also remains overactive.\n\n>A growing body of research indicates that overactivity of the brain's immune cells (microglia) can lead to a gradual loss of brain connections (synapses and dendrites) and can even cause the brain to be miswired (abnormal pathways development). \n\nMany pediatricians may know very little about the immune system and possible negative effects from vaccines or combination of vaccines. Dr. Blaylock continues with this damning pronouncement:\n\n>Anyone with even a basic understanding of immunology or having read the available research on the effects of excessive vaccination on the developing brain, would know that the present crowded vaccine schedule is extremely destructive to the child's brain. Likewise, there seems to be little concern as to the effects of multiple immunizations on the developing child's immune system.\n\n>Pediatricians and public health authorities are of the opinion that they can give an unlimited number of vaccines to babies and small children without risk. Our neuroscience proves this is insane. Almost every year, these vaccine enthusiasts add another set of vaccines to the schedule, despite the growing list of neurological and other health disasters occurring in our children.\n\n\u201cPriming\u201d the microglia can increase the damage caused by vaccinations or even natural infections.\n\n>Let's say a newborn is given the hepatitis B vaccine before leaving the hospital. The vaccine activates the baby's brain microglia (called priming). Then, let's say the child develops an ear infection. The ear infection once again activates the baby's immune microglia, but this time the activation is greatly aggravated because of the previous vaccine-induced priming, resulting in a seizure or even sudden death. The pediatrician will blame it on the ear infection, not the previous vaccine.\n\nThere can be *many* factors that contribute to tragedies such as SIDS...and it may be premature to dismiss vaccine reactions as a possible cause.\n\n>Another scenario would be a baby who receives a hepatitis B vaccine at birth and then gets his or her DtaP vaccine within months of birth. Two weeks later, mom finds the baby dead in its crib. The doctor blames it on SIDS and never reports it to the CDC as a vaccine reaction.\n\n>In this case the triple antigen exposure (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) triggers the baby's already primed microglia\u2014this time in the brainstem, where the respiratory control neurons reside. When the baby is placed on its stomach, it cannot muster enough force to fill its lungs. Any fumes from the mattress only aggravate the problem.\n\n>For the pediatrician, it is easier and safer to blame it on a mysterious disorder called SIDS, than to admit it was a sequential vaccine reaction.\n\n>Another thing that can prime microglia is vaccine adjuvants such as aluminum, mercury and protein additives. These products easily enter the brain, are stored for decades and can powerfully activate the brain's microglia, and do so for prolonged periods.\n\nAluminum is a very powerful inducer of brain microglia, and since aluminum has an immune-enhancing effect, many manufacturers add aluminum to vaccines. It wasn't until recently that vaccine authorities started officially acknowledging the danger of the possible toxicity of aluminum in vaccines.\n\n>In addition, injected aluminum can complex with fluoride within the body to produce a compound, fluoroaluminum, that has a number of harmful effects, including brain injury. [There is some evidence](http://australianfluorideaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/DR-RUSSELL-BLAYLOCK-Fluoride-excitototoxin-paper.pdf) that fluoride can trigger microglia activation and excitotoxicity, which in combination is particularly injurious to the brain.\n\nIn 2001, [a new condition was described](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11522584) by Dr. R.K. Gherardi and co-workers that linked muscle pains and neurological problems with retained aluminum resulting form aluminum hydroxide vaccine adjuvants. The problem was linked to hepatitis B, hepatitis A or tetanus toxoid vaccines.\n\n>A subsequent report found a number of patients with a multiple sclerosis-like illness. In 2004, [a study reported in the journal *Neurology*](http://www.neurology.org/content/63/5/838.abstract) found that people exposed to the complete series of hepatitis B vaccines experienced a 300% higher risk of developing multiple sclerosis than the unvaccinated public.\n\nThe study concludes: \u201cThese findings are consistent with the hypothesis that immunization with the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine is associated with an increased risk of MS, and challenge the idea that the relation between hepatitis B vaccination and risk of MS is well understood.\u201d\n\nVaccines can be, and have been, contaminated by bacteria, viruses, viral fragments and mycoplasma. Once injected, they can enter the brain and continue to prime the brain's microglia for a lifetime.\n\n>Another consideration is the ability of attenuated viruses to undergo mutation over time, eventually resulting in organisms that can cause new disease. When live viruses are used to make vaccines, a process of repeated passage of the virus through growth media reduces its virulence, or the ability of the virus to cause disease.\n\n>However, as occurs with measles, rubella and many other viruses used in vaccines, once in the body the attenuated viruses can be converted to quite virulent viruses. This is thought to explain the high incidence of Crohn's disease in people who were vaccinated as children with live measles viruses.\n\n[This 2001 study actually found](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11572573?dopt=Abstract) that the mutated measles viruses were different in each tissue, meaning that a variety of disorders are possible.\n\n>The risk of persistent viruses following vaccination with live viruses appears to be growing and may be secondary to a number of factors, which include the nutritional status of the person and preexistence of immune suppression. Immunologists have voiced concern that the growing number of vaccines being given early in life may impair immune function for life.\n\nAnother concern is with organisms that contain dozens or more subtypes. Many vaccines will target only a handful of these subtypes, creating the potential for new subtypes to emerge and become even more carcinogenic. \n\nFor example, HPV (human papilloma virus) has over 100 subtypes, yet the vaccine protects against only four. The other subtypes that in the past rarely produced disease might be given a fresh opportunity.\n\nA major issue with the vaccine program is the lack of long-term protection that occurs after you are *naturally* infected with a disease. Today, most younger people don't have natural immunization. In the past, the majority of the population had life-long protection from diseases like measles, rubella, chickenpox, etc., and this protected mothers and their newborn children as well. Vaccinated mothers do not offer this protection.\n\n>Of great concern is the recent finding that immune activation in pregnant women can have dire consequences for the developing baby. At one time it was thought that viral infections in the mother endangered the baby because the virus was passed through the placenta into the baby's body.\n\n>[New research demonstrates](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11695949) that it is the mother's immune cytokines that are causing the damage, once they enter the baby's body, and is not caused by the virus itself.\n\n>Researchers found that the eventual effect of maternal immune stimulation depended on the timing of the immune activation. Activations at mid-term could result in autism; stimulation late in the pregnancy could result in schizophrenia as the child grows into adulthood.\n\n>What this means is that vaccinating a pregnant woman is associated with a high risk of autism, psychosis and other neurological problems as the baby reaches adolescence or adulthood. This is being completely ignored by those designing vaccines and making recommendations. At present, flu, chickenpox, hep B and rubella vaccines are recommended for pregnant women.\n\nHPV vaccination *used* to be recommended for pregnant women as well, but it caused enough birth defects and death that this practice ceased.",

Vaccines were overwhelmingly believed to have saved humanity from a variety of diseases that had plagued mankind for generations. Although mistakes had been made, for the most part, \u201cthe benefits far outweigh the negative effects.\u201d\n\nToday, the accepted \u201cwisdom\u201d holds that although severe reactions to vaccines have been documented, including brain damage and death, they are rare enough that the success of the vaccine \u201cprogram\u201d is more important. [According to Russell Blaylock, MD:](http://www.scribd.com/doc/11564541/CH-51-Vaccine-saftey-forward)\n\n>I reported a conversation coming from the Simpsonwood conference held in Norcross, Georgia, attended by 53 specialists in vaccine effects\u2014including members of the World Health Organization and major vaccine manufacturers\u2014concerning data indicating that vaccines were causing a statistically significant increase in childhood neurodevelopmental problems.\n\n>One of the attended stated that his main goal is to see that every child in this country receives his vaccines, today, tomorrow and forever. In other words, he could care less that the vaccines are significantly damaging children's brains and altering their brain development.\n\n[Russell Blaylock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Blaylock), although a somewhat controversial figure, is known for his work in pioneering treatments for certain brain tumors, \u201cas well as improving certain operations treating water on the brain.\u201d\n\nSome of Dr. Blaylock's controversial views include his claim that aspartame may be unsafe even in small doses and that the H1N1 (swine flu) vaccine may carry more risks than the flu itself.\n\nBlaylock claims that physicians [are more regimented than any time in history](http://whale.to/a/regimentation.html) and that \u201ctoday they do what they are told without question.\u201d\n\nBecause of this regimentation\u2014this death of creativity\u2014most doctors are completely unprepared when confronted with potentially vaccine-damaged children and their parents.\n\nAlthough a popular field in neuroscience, many physicians know very little about [excitotoxicity,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitotoxin) the major mechanism in virtually all brain disorders. Blaylock, [who wrote a book on the subject,](http://www.amazon.com/Excitotoxins-The-Taste-That-Kills/dp/0929173252/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1396995098&sr=8-1&keywords=excitotoxins) continues:\n\n>Some of the most devastating side effects of vaccines involve neurological damage, including encephalitis, transverse myelitis, peripheral nerve damage, seizures, mental retardation, language delays, multiple sclerosis, behavioral problems, and [SSPE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sspe).\n\n>Most physicians, especially pediatricians, think these events are \u201crare\u201d and must be accepted to gain the benefit of vaccines. In fact, these adverse vaccine reactions are not as rare as many believe...medical authorities are using clever ploys to hide and alter the data on vaccine injuries.\n\n>They reclassify problems, deny a connection to the vaccines and more often than not, just brush such reactions off as \u201cnormal.\u201d For example, one deception is to classify cases of polio as \u201caseptic meningitis.\u201d By doing so, vaccine proponents can give the illusion that the polio vaccine policy was more successful than it actually was.\n\nAn example of this reclassification ploy is the label of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). [In a 1982 study,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170075/) 70% of SIDS cases were shown to follow the DPT vaccination within three weeks.\n\n>In order to avoid admitting that the sudden stoppage of breathing by a baby within hours to weeks of these vaccines was due to the vaccines, the vaccine defenders merely created a new disease and gave it the incredible name of sudden infant death syndrome, which is like naming it the \u201cBaby Mysteriously Dies of Anything but a Vaccine Injury Syndrome.\u201d\n\nAs is detailed in David Oshinsky's [Polio: An American Story](http://www.amazon.com/Polio-American-David-M-Oshinsky/dp/0195307143/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1396995523&sr=8-1&keywords=polio+an+american+story), the early creators of the polio vaccine knew the product was contaminated with an unknown number of viruses, and that at least 100 million people have been exposed to these viruses.\n\n>They also knew that [Dr. Bernice Eddy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernice_Eddy), a microbiologist at the National Institutes of Health, had proven that the [SV40](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40) virus, present in both the killed and live vaccines, caused cancer in experimental animals. The public was not informed of this contamination until decades later. Worse, they continued to give the tainted vaccine to children assuming that it would not cause cancer. Modern science has proven them wrong.\n\nDr. Blaylock continues by observing that most physicians, even pediatricians, know little about the brains of young children:\n\n>There is evidence that the great number of vaccines given to our children, and adults, is causing injury to their nervous systems and that it reduces the ability of people to think, learn, behave and function as normal adults.\n\n>It is well known and accepted that when you vaccinate someone, lets say by a shot in the arm, the body's immune system is thrown into high gear. What is less well known by doctors in practice, especially by pediatricians, is that it also activates the brain's special immune system.\n\n>The central immune cells in the brain are called microglia (they also involve astrocytes). These normally sleeping immune cells become highly activated when a vaccination is given. Until activated they remain immobile, but after activation they can move around the brain like an amoeba, secreting very toxic amounts of inflammatory chemicals (called cytokines) and two forms of excitotoxins (glutamate and quinolinic acid). This puts the brain in a chronically inflamed state.\n\nThere can also be the risk of vaccine-induced seizures:\n\n>Multiple vaccines during a single visit, or combination vaccines, raise the risk even higher. Seizures following a vaccination are due to two things happening in the brain. One is that many vaccines can cause a high fever, and this can trigger a seizure in seizure-prone babies, children and some adults.\n\n>It is also known that overstimulation of the immune system, which can occur with certain types of vaccines and especially when multiple vaccines are given during one office visit, can cause seizures. The excess activation of the body's immune system leads to overactivation of the brain's microglia, and the subsequent release of the excitotoxins leads to the seizure. This mechanism has been carefully worked out in the laboratory\u2014it is not a theory.\n\nBlaylock believes that vaccines can cause seizures even days later and that multiple seizures indicate a severely inflamed brain and the need for immediate medical attention. These \u201cseizures\u201d can also be \u201csilent\u201d in that they can be expressed behaviorally, such as periods of confusion or irritability.\n\nThe human brain develops much differently than most animals in that long after birth the brain still undergoes dramatic formation of its pathways. Much of this formation happens within the first two years, although it continues until age 25-27.\n\n>Excess vaccination disrupts this critical process and can result in a malformed brain, which manifests as either subtle impairment in thinking, concentration, attention, behavior or language, or serious problems with these processes. \n\n>It has also been shown that excess immune stimulation by vaccination can trigger an interaction between excitotoxicity and brain inflammatory cytokines that greatly magnifies the damage, and can do so for decades.",

[Reuters Health. [\u201cPolio outbreak in Dominican Republic and Haiti caused by vaccine-derived virus.\u201d](http://www.medscape.com/infectiousdiseases]) *Reuters Medical News* (December 4, 2000)]\n\n>In 1993, Dr. Radu Crainic of the Pasteur Institute [discovered that strains of the polio virus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8102826) have the ability to spontaneously recombine with themselves and create new strains. \n\n>Crainic showed that if you vaccinate a child with polio strains 1, 2, and 3, you can produce a new strain, strain 4, out of the child's stool. Crainic concluded that the polio vaccine creates favorable conditions contributing to the evolution of viral \u201crecombinations.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, virologist Hiromy Yoshida [found a new infectious polio virus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11081527) in Japanese rivers and sewages. The virus had mutated from the polio vaccine and regained much of its original virulence, as confirmed by genetic sequencing. According to Yoshida, this poses a \u201cpersistent environmental threat\u201d and the live oral polio vaccine is to blame.\n\nAccording to a 2000 *Reuters Medical News* article, a polio outbreak in Haiti and the Dominican Republic resulted in numerous cases of flaccid paralysis. \n\n>Laboratory examinations confirmed health authorities' worst suspicions: the disease was caused by \u201can unusual viral derivative\u201d of the polio vaccine. The virus demonstrates genetic similarity to the parent vaccine strain, \u201cbut it has assumed the neuro-virulence and transmissibility\u201d of the wild polio virus. \n\n>Health officials are obviously concerned, \u201cbecause a wild poliovirus has not circulated in the Western Hemisphere since 1991,\u201d and if the newly mutated polio virus spreads, it could cause new epidemics of the disease.\n\nPeople around the world continue to be stricken with vaccine-derived polio viruses (VDPVs), and the aforementioned case in India is just one example. Under certain circumstances, polio viruses within the vaccine [\u201cregain both neuro-virulence and the capacity to circulate and cause outbreaks.\u201d](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5540a3.htm)\n\n>For example, from 2001 to 2005, there were several vaccine-derived polio outbreaks in the Philippines, Madagascar, China and Indonesia. In 2006, additional cases of vaccine-derived polio were recorded in Cambodia.\n\nIn 2010, [a study was published in Finland](http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19566) with a title that just about says it all: \u201cHighly divergent neurovirulent vaccine-derived polioviruses of all three serotypes are recurrently detected in Finnish sewage.\u201d\n\nAlthough no cases of \u201csuspected poliomyelitis\u201d have reportedly occurred in Finland since 1985, \u201cSince December 2008, 21 genetically highly divergent, neurovirulent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV) have been isolated from sewage in Tampere, Finland. While the source of the VDPV is unknown, characteristics of the viruses resemble those of strains isolated from immunodeficient, persistently infected persons.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, animal matter and questionable drugs are still used in making the polio vaccine.\n\n>Despite the polio vaccine's long history of causing polio, and the manufacturer's inability to protect the public from dangerous microorganisms that perpetually contaminate an ever expanding repertoire of \u201cnew and improved\u201d products, the currently available inactivated, or \u201ckilled-virus\u201d polio vaccine continues to be manufactured in much the same way as earlier versions.\n\n>In the United States, today's polio vaccine is a sterile suspensions of three types of poliovirus. The viruses are grown in cultures of \u201ca continuous line of monkey kidney cells...supplemented with newborn calf serum...\u201d The vaccine also contains two antibiotics (neomycin and streptomycin), in addition to formaldehyde as a preservative.\n\n>In Canada, the inactivated polio vaccine is made in \u201chuman diploid cells\u201d instead of monkey kidneys. Some researchers believe this is a safer alternative. [According to Barbara Loe Fisher](http://www.nvic.org/vaccines-and-diseases/Polio-SV40/prpolio12798.aspx), president of the National Vaccine Information Center in Virginia, \u201cWith mounting evidence that cross-species transfer of viruses can occur, the United States should no longer be using animal tissues to produce vaccines.\u201d\n\nDr. Arthur Levine of the NIH, however, [believes that making polio vaccines](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1980&dat=19970129&id=vJAiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=560FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1389,5403613) using human cells isn't risk-free either, \u201cbecause they must be tested for human infections.\u201d\n\nLevine also worries that even discussing these issues will frighten parents, \u201cWe do a grave disservice to the public if we were now to question the safety of the current polio vaccines on the basis of SV40.\u201d\n\nIt is perhaps this attitude that prompted the CDC to recently remove the section of their website devoted to SV40 information. However, how can this be justified when hundreds of studies have now been conducted linking SV40 to cancer?\n\n>Barbara Loe Fisher would like to see changes in the way vaccine safety is governed. She believes that agencies like the FDA have an inherent conflict of interest because of their mandate to promote universal vaccination on one hand and regulate vaccine safety on the other. \u201cWho's minding the store when the FDA has allowed drug companies to produce vaccines grown on contaminated monkey kidneys?\u201d\n\n>Dr. Urnovitz is even more resolute in his convictions. He thinks that an extensive study of human exposure to simian microbes is long overdue. \u201cHalf of the people in this country are baby boomers who were born between 1941 and 1961 and are at high risk for having been exposed to polio vaccines contaminated with monkey viruses. Are we just a time bomb waiting to happen, waiting to develop lupus, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease?\u201d\n\nUrnovitz sums it up nicely, \u201cYou have to realize that if you mess around with nature, you're going to pay the price...\u201d",

The fact that they haven't done so is evidence there's something wrong with the vaccine.\u201d\n\n##How Now, Mad Cow\n\nBovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, was first noticed in the mid-1980s. Mad cow disease is a progressive nerve disorder of cattle that's similar to scrapie, a disease that affects sheep. \n\n>Authorities believe it spread to cows from sheep when they were fed scrapie-infected bone meal. [Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creutzfeldt%E2%80%93Jakob_disease) (CJD and vCJD (a newly discovered variant) are the human equivalents of mad cow disease. They cause a comparable wasting of the brain leading to muscle incoordination, sensory loss, and mental confusion. It is always fatal.\n\nMad cow disease and the newly discovered variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob may be caused by the same infectious agent. [A study published in *Nature*](http://www.mad-cow.org/~tom/spont_monkey.html) showed that monkeys injected with BSE developed very similar symptoms to vCJD. They also have similar molecular characteristics.\n\nMad cow disease can be passed from cows to humans if they ingest BSE-infected beef, [*or if they receive vaccines contaminated with BSE.*](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/oct/21/nhs.bse)\n\n>BSE-associated infectious agents are capable of contaminating polio vaccines because polio vaccines are not only grown in monkey kidneys, but in calf serum as well. In fact, many parts of the cow are used in vaccine production. Glycerol is derived from cow fat; gelatin and amino acids come from cow bones; and the growth medium for viruses and other microorganism may require cow skeletal muscle, enzymes, and blood.\n\n>Authorities knew that vaccines could be infected with BSE-associated transmissible agents as early as 1988. Yet, in England, [vaccine manufacturers waited months](http://www.mad-cow.org/00/may00_news.html) before switching to cows less likely to be infected and refused to removed current stock off the shelves and out of doctor's offices until it was all sold, or expired five years later toward the end of 1993.\n\nAccording to one British legislator, \u201cThe Department of Health was potentially criminally negligent in not requiring the immediate withdrawal or cessation of use of vaccines from potentially contaminated sources. It is also beyond belief the Department should not even have monitored those who were injected, and is now trying to sweep the whole thing under the carpet.\u201d\n\n>Finally, in October 2000, the Department of Health became so concerned about the likelihood of of children being infected with BSE-contaminated vaccines and falling prey to vCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease\u2014dozens of people, including children, had already contracted it\u2014that they [issued a recall](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/oct/21/nhs.bse) of hundreds of thousands of polio vaccines made using fetal bovine serum extracted from British cows.\n\nIn the United States, [the FDA issued a \u201cwarning\u201d to manufacturers](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1843322) in 1996 instructing them to \u201ctake whatever steps are necessary to reduce potential risk of transmission of BSE agent.\u201d By 2000, the FDA realized that its \u201crecommendations\u201d were being ignored, for vaccines were still being made in bovine materials from countries reporting BSE. These vaccines wouldn't be removed from the market until 2002, when all existing stock had been purchased.\n\nAlthough cows in America don't exhibit \u201cmad cow symptoms,\u201d tens of thousands of cattle are severely incapacitated each year in what some have suggested may be related to BSE. These \u201cdowned\u201d animals have not been ruled out of vaccine production by the FDA.\n\n>Dr. Richard Marsh of the Department of Animal Health and Biomedical Sciences at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, [conducted research](http://www.mad-cow.org/~tom/marsh_milkfever.html) providing evidence that down cattle in the U.S. may harbor a new variant of mad cow disease. He inoculated cows with TME, a variant of BSE. They became \u201cdowned\u201d instead of \u201cmad.\u201d\n\n>[Other scientists](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8133096) inoculated cows with scrapie from U.S. sheep. They, too, became \u201cdowned\u201d instead of \u201cmad.\u201d\n\nAccording to Farm Sanctuary, a national non-profit organization dedicated to preventing irresponsible agricultural practices, \u201cWe are concerned that, like in Britain, there is a powerful economic incentive to ignore evidence that BSE, or a variant of BSE, exists in the U.S.\u201d",

Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin would scuffle over whose vaccine was the true prophylactic, [Dr. Hilary Koprowski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Koprowski) announced at a medical conference that he had become the first doctor in history [to test polio vaccine on humans.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2096806/) His \u201cvolunteers\u201d included several institutionalized children with mental handicaps. They drank the vaccine in chocolate milk.\n\n>From 1957 to 1960, after years of tinkering with monkey kidneys and polio germs, Koprowski tested his own experimental polio vaccine on 325,000 equatorial Africans, including 75,000 citizens of Leopoldville, Belgian Congo (now Kinshasa, Zaire). \n\n>[Called by drums,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2555313/) rural natives traveled to local villages where they had a liquid vaccines squirted into their mouths. 98% of the vaccine recipients were infants and toddlers. [The youngest children](http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/94tld.html) received 15 times the adult dosage. Though Koprowski claimed he had the backing of the World Health Organization, [WHO denied](http://www.amazon.com/Trial-Fury-Polio-Vaccine-Controversy/dp/0684129973/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1397858991&sr=1-1&keywords=klein+trial+by+fury) sanctioning the large-scale trials.\n\nIn 1959, Albert Sabin [published a study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1993129/) that claimed that Koprowski's polio vaccine used in the African trials contained un \u201cunidentified\u201d and \u201cunstable\u201d cell-killing virus. Although he was quick to point out the flaws in the vaccine of Koprowski, his professional rival, unfortunately his ability to detect viruses in the polio vaccine fell short when it came to mass contamination of Sabin's *own* polio vaccine with SV-40.\n\nIn response to Sabin's claims of contamination, Koprowski simply scoffed at him and said he was just trying to discredit his work (as he would do again and again to anyone making this accusation). The virus allegedly detected by Sabin was never identified.\n\nUntil recently, [the earliest known blood sample](http://www.popline.org/node/366900) containing antibodies against HIV was traced back to 1959. The serum came from a patient visiting a clinic in Leopoldville, one of the epicenters of the AIDS epidemic that would occur a decade later. \n\n\n>Gerald Myers, a genetic sequencing expert with Los Alamos National Laboratories in New Mexico, [tracked the evolution of HIV](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1549779) and confirmed that today's major subtypes of the AIDS virus in humans appear to have arisen as recently as 1960.\n\n>Although [this time period](http://www.bmj.com/content/315/7123/1689) is widely accepted by medical researchers, [more recent conflicting reports](http://www.pnas.org/content/100/11/6588.short) suggest that the first HIV infection may have occurred years earlier. \n\nRegardless of *when* the first HIV infection occurred, it would seem to be premature to dismiss the [OPV (Oral Polio Vaccine) AIDS hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPV_AIDS_hypothesis) on this basis alone. The timing of the first HIV infection is irrelevant to the question of whether or not some doses of the experimental polio vaccine used in Africa in the late 1950s were contaminated, thus precipitating a future outbreak.\n\n>Koprowski's vaccine was not approved for human use, so it was discontinued in 1960 following the African trials. Thus, it was only administered to inhabitants of the Belgian Congo, Rwanda and Burundi\u2014the precise area where high levels of HIV infection [were identified](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3321361) by researcher 30 years later. \n\n>Furthermore, the AIDS virus is known to infect mucous cells, prevalent in the mouth. The African vaccines were squirted into people's mouths.\n\n>Could squirting an HIV-contaminated polio vaccine into people's mouths cause AIDS? [According to Tom Folks](http://www.whale.to/vaccines/curtis.htm), chief retrovirologist at the CDC, \u201cAny time a person has a lesion in his mouth, then there could be transmission\u201d of the virus.\n\nDr. Robert Bohannon of Baylor College of Medicine asserts that squiring polio vaccines into one's mouth would tend to aerosolize some of the liquid. Small drops could then go into the lungs, and from there to the blood cells susceptible to infection. This [could be](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7935079) an efficient mode of HIV transmission.\n\nExperts believe that the average time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS is approximately 8-10 years. \n\n>If the African polio vaccine was indeed contaminated with SIV/HIV, initial outbreaks of AIDS would have occurred from the mid-1960s to early 1970s. This period [accurately coincides](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3423743) with the emergence of AIDS in equatorial Africa.\n\nUnderstandably, authorities are very reluctant to admit that there's even a possibility that scientists may have contributed to the AIDS pandemic by growing polio vaccines in virus-laden monkey kidneys.\n\nIn 1992, Tom Curtis [published a story](http://www.whale.to/vaccines/curtis.htm) for *Rolling Stone* that created quite a stir.\n\nAlthough dismissed by most experts, \u201ca few scientists, notably the biologist [W.D. Hamilton,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W.D._Hamilton) thought the hypothesis required serious investigation, but they received little support from the scientific community.\u201d\n\nWilliam Haseltine, a professor at Harvard, believes that hypothesizing about the origin of AIDS is distracting and nonproductive, saying, \u201cIt's not relevant...I'm not interested in discussing it.\u201d  Dr. David Heymann, head of the WHO's Global Program of AIDS, stated that \u201cthe origin of the AIDS virus is of no importance to science today.\u201d\n\nJonas Salk wouldn't comment on the possibility, as apparently he was too busy working on an AIDS vaccine, and Sabin's response was \u201cyou can't hang Koprowski with that.\u201d Koprowski himself initially dismissed the idea with a laugh, and then later said that \u201cthis is a highly theoretical situation.\u201d\n\nHis amusement must not have lasted long, because Koprowski sued Curtis and *Rolling Stone* for \u201c...the destruction of (his) professional and personal reputation, for mental and emotional suffering, and for...humiliation and embarrassment.\u201d As a result [the magazine was ordered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPV_AIDS_hypothesis#Development_of_hypothesis) to pay *$1* in damages. [[See *The Seeds of Doom* by Christian Biasco](http://biasco.ch/materiale/OdM/testo/SeedsOfDoom2006_10_05rev.pdf)]\n\nHowever, both Tom Folks of the CDC and Robert Gallo thought testing the seed stocks of polio might be a good idea. According to Folks, \u201cany time we can learn more about the natural history [of AIDS], it helps us understand the pathogenesis and...the transmission.\u201d \n\nGallo believes that questions like this \u201care of more than academic interest because answering them may help avoid future zoonitic catastrophes\u2014that is, transmission of disease from lower animals to humans.\u201d\n\n>Responding to these concerns, some AIDS researchers formally requested samples of the original polio vaccine seed stocks. But the government would neither release nor test them because there are \u201conly a small number of vials\u201d of the material, and tests \u201cmight use it all up.\u201d\n\nInspired by Curtis' investigative report, a British writer named [Edward Hooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hooper) traveled in Africa, Europe, and the United States for seven years. As a result of his research, he published a book in 1999 called [The River: A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316371378/mongabay-20).\n\nAlthough the scientific community generally rejects the OPV AIDS hypothesis, Hooper \u201ccriticizes the research and conduct of many of the scientists involved in the investigation and alleges a 'very substantial cover-up' took place to silence the hypothesis.\u201d\n\nOne of the several arguments against the hypothesis was that Koprowski was not using chimpanzees in his experiments, and therefore HIV contamination didn't occur. However, [eyewitness testimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPV_AIDS_hypothesis#Development_of_hypothesis) suggests otherwise.\n\n>In 2004, [The Origins of AIDS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm5AvCc5lzs), a French TV documentary strongly supportive of the OPV hypothesis, appeared on several television stations around the world.\n\nThe [film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438938/) offers a convincing case for the hypothesis, and seriously challenges the questionable nature of the categorical denials by Koprowski and others that no chimpanzees were used in the development of his experimental vaccine.

After all, SIV was very similar to HIV [and occurred naturally in the monkey species](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7935079) predominantly used by vaccine manufacturers.\n\nHowever, WHO concluded the vaccines were safe enough and insisted the mass vaccination campaigns continue. By 1989, they recommended not making the polio vaccine using monkeys infected with SIV.\n\nThe following year, wild chimpanzees in Africa [were found to be infected](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2188136) with a strain of SIV that was almost identical to HIV.\n[Some researchers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2342562) even referred to it as the \u201cmissing link\u201d to the origins of HIV.\n\n>Since chimpanzees were used to test viruses for potential use in vaccines, and were kept in captivity by research laboratories, they could have been a source of vaccine contamination.\n\n>Scientific concerns were also heightened when researchers found some West Africans who were infected with an SIV-like virus that was a fundamental twin to HIV. They called it HIV-2, and like the initial HIV subtype, [it was implicated](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2867393) in the development of AIDS.\n\n[According to Robert Gallo](http://www.whale.to/vaccines/curtis.htm): \u201cThe monkey virus is the human virus. There are monkey viruses as close to isolates of HIV-2 as HIV-2 isolates are to each others.\u201d\n\nBy 1991, as the result of improvements in virus-detection techniques, [researchers found SIV DNA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2019773) in the kidneys of infected monkeys. [Minced monkey kidneys](http://www.whale.to/vaccines/curtis.htm) were, and still are, used to produce the live polio vaccine.\n\n>SIV was also found in the cancer cells [of an AIDS victim](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1717707), and in other people as well. To many researchers, this trail of evidence had become too persuasive to deny. Apparently, millions of people were infected with [monkey viruses capable of causing AIDS,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1571197) and this cross-species transfer very likely occurred by way of SIV-contaminated polio vaccines. \n\nGiunta, S., et al.

At stake are millions of research dollars and potential medical treatments for those afflicted with the cancers SV40 may be causing. \n\n>\u201cI believe that SV40 is carcinogenic (in humans),\u201d said Dr. Michele Carbone of Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, Ill. \u201cWe need to be creating therapies for people who have these cancers, and now we may be able to because we have a target\u2014SV40.\u201d\n\n>But scientists at the National Cancer Institute say their studies show almost no SV40 in human tumors and no cancer increase in people who received the contaminated vaccine. \u201cNo one would dispute there's been a widespread, very scary exposure to the population of potentially cancer-causing virus,\u201d said Dr. Howard Strickler, NCI's chief investigator. \u201cBut none of our studies and other major analyses have shown an inkling of an effect on the population.\u201d\n\n>Critics charge, however, that the few studies done by the government are scientifically flawed and that health officials have downplayed the potential risks posed by SV40 ever since they learned in 1961 that the virus contaminated the polio vaccine and caused tumors in rodents. \n\n>\u201cHow long can the government ignore this?\u201d asked Dr. Adi Gazdar, a University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center cancer researcher. \u201cThe government has not sponsored any real research. Here's something possibly affecting millions of Americans, and they're indifferent. Maybe they don't want to find out.\u201d\n\nIn 1998, after a national cancer database was analyzed, it was determined that among those exposed to SV40 from the polio vaccine, there were 17% more bone cancers, 20% more brain cancers, and *178%* more mesotheliomas. [Researchers also found](http://www.nccn.net/~wwithin/polio.htm) 10 times more osteosarcoma rates.\n\nEven more alarming, [some research suggests](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2835679) that SV40 can be passed from human to human and form mother to child. [A study of nearly 60,000 women](http://www.whale.to/vaccines/curtis.htm) found that children of mothers who received the Salk vaccine in the early 1960s had brain tumors at a rate 13 times greater than mothers who didn't receive the shot.\n\nAlso, [a 1996 study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8841004) published in the journal *Cancer Research* found SV40 in 23% of blood samples and 45% of semen taken from healthy subjects. Mauro Tognon, one of the authors of this study, believes this might explain why brain, bone, and lung cancers are on the rise.\n\n>Despite official denials of any correlation between SV40-contaminated polio vaccines and increased cancer rates, by April 2001, [62 papers from 30 laboratories](http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Rogue-virus-in-the-vaccine-Early-polio-vaccine-2899957.php) around the world had reported SV40 in human tissues and tumors. Even the National Cancer Institute issued a statement that SV40 \u201cmay be associated with human cancer.\u201d\n\nWhy the uncertainty? Why the obfuscation? Why the silence? In his book [The Health Century,](http://www.whale.to/v/eddy.html) Edward Shorter asks these questions and quotes an extraordinary statement made by Albert Sabin:\n\n>Was this silence merely the incompetence of the press in the face of a complex scientific question, or was there a deliberate effort to keep a lid on the story? Albert Sabin was asked thirty years later why the silence? \u201cI think to release certain information prematurely,\u201d he said, \u201cis not a public service. There's too much scaring the public unnecessarily. Oh, your children were injected with a cancer virus and all that. That's not very good.\u201d\n\nToday, [the SV40 Cancer Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40_Cancer_Foundation) is devoted to raising awareness about a potential link between the simian virus and human cancer.\n\n>The SV40 Cancer Foundation was founded by Raphaele and Michael Horwin. The Horwin's son Alexander Horwin was born on June 7, 1996 and was given the oral polio vaccine in November 1997. Alexander was diagnosed with medulloblastoma, a malignant brain cancer, leading to his death on January 31, 1999. \n\n>The Horwins contend that the polio vaccine their son ingested was contaminated with SV40, leading to his death. Four independent PCR tests performed at four separate research institutes on Alexander's brain tissue demonstrated the presence of the virus.\n\n*The Virus and the Vaccine* documents the incredible saga of the Horwin family. The vaccine manufacturer unsuccessfully tried to argue in court that the SV40 contamination was the result of a trip to the zoo (!), but the Horwin family had overwhelming scientific evidence on their side. \n\nTragically, although the judge admitted the polio vaccine was the likely origin of the SV40 that was found in his tumor, the vaccine manufacturer was exonerated because their equipment was insufficient and unable to offer 100% certainty that the product would be SV40-free.\n\nOne of the most important reasons this subject needs to be *thoroughly* studied is that traditional methods of cancer treatment such as chemotherapy [may make SV40-related cancers worse:](http://www.sv40foundation.org/Treating.html)\n\n>It is well documented that SV40 binds with tumor suppressor genes p53 and RB. These genes and their proteins are needed to drive a damaged cell towards apoptosis\u2014programmed cell death. Apoptosis is a critical cellular function that stops the growth of tumors in man.\n\n>Cell-killing or cytotoxic therapies like chemotherapy and radiation utilize apoptosis. These therapies cause cellular DNA damage such as point mutations, strand breaks, and other disturbances to a cell\u2019s DNA. This DNA damage, in turn, triggers the apoptosis which leads to cell death. In this way, chemo and radiation kill cells (cancer cells and healthy cells). \n\n>However, when the large T antigen (Tag) of SV40 is present in a cancer cell it binds p53 and RB and stops these genes from working. There is no apoptosis. The result is that chemo and radiation kill healthy cells, *but the cancerous cells infected with SV40\u2019s Tag live on with even more mutations.* \n\n>*This means that standard cancer therapies may only make a SV40 cancer more abnormal and aggressive and less responsive to standard cytotoxic therapies.*\n\n>Knowing this, you would think that a patient who is diagnosed with a cancer associated with SV40 (i.e. brain cancers, mesothelioma, bone cancers, Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, and thyroid cancers) would have their cancer tested for the presence of this virus. And, if the virus is present, the patient would be offered rational therapies.\n\n>Unfortunately, this is not the case. There are no prospective tests or trials in which SV40 status is used in clinical decision-making. Instead, tumors are tested often after a patient has died to determine whether it contained SV40. At this point, there is no benefit to the patient.\n\n>SV40 is a problem that federal government authorities have not addressed responsibly because the government\u2019s own vaccine programs are responsible for the spread of the virus throughout the western world. Federal authorities are so concerned about being blamed for unleashing a cancer-causing monkey virus that they would rather ignore its role in cancer than take the appropriate steps to develop rational therapies.",

From the Wikipedia page of American physician [Herbert Ratner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Ratner):\n\n>In 1960 Ratner learned that a government researcher Dr. Bernice Eddy had discovered evidence of a cancer-causing agent that she described as a vacuolating virus in the Salk vaccine rhesus-monkey-kidney culture medium. \n\n>Dr. Ben Sweet working under Dr. Maurice Hilleman at Merck observed a similar agent in the same kind of medium that they were using to develop a vaccine for adenovirus. The agent was later identified as a monkey virus and named Simian Virus 40 (SV40). Sweet & Hilleman published their work in November 1960 and Eddy published her work in May 1961. \n\n>The unused box of 1955 Salk polio vaccine Ratner had placed in his refrigerator remained there for more than forty years. \n\n>In the meantime researchers had begun to discover that SV40 was associated with various cancers. One of these researchers was Dr. Michele Carbone, a molecular pathologist of Italian birth and education, then working at the University of Chicago.\n\n>Eventually the entire box of remaining vials was given to Carbone in the presence of a lawyer and witnesses. In these vials Carbone discovered two separate strains of SV40, one of which was a slow-growing strain previously not known to have been in polio vaccines and for which the vaccines currently being marketed were not being tested. \n\n>Moreover, this slow-growing strain was the same as one found in some types of cancerous tumors. Had Ratner not saved vials of vaccine, the source of this slow-growing strain would have been suspected but unproven.\n\nNot only is SV40 showing up in brain tumors and leukemia, but according to research conducted by Carbone and others, SV40 is being detected in 38% of patients with bone cancer and in 58% of those with mesothelioma, a deadly type of lung cancer. Carbone's pioneering work indicates that SV40 blocks an important protein that normally protects cells from becoming malignant.\n\nCarbone, M., et al.

For her efforts, she was removed from polio research at the NIH. \n\nFor a complete account of Eddy and her story, [read The Virus and the Vaccine: Contaminated Vaccine, Deadly Cancers, and Government Neglect](http://www.vaksinite.info/The%20Virus%20and%20the%20Vaccine.html).\n\nHistory, as they say, is doomed to repeat herself, for Eddy would yet again discover something was wrong with the polio vaccine. This time, however, the ramifications would be far more catastrophic, and her subsequent silencing was much more profound.\n\nDr. Eddy was fresh from her research into viral causes of cancer and her pioneering work in first describing [the polyoma virus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomaviridae). However, she soon would earn the dubious honor of being the first to identify what we now call [SV40](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV-40) (Simian virus 40), an infectious agent capable of causing cancer. \n\nSV40 had widely contaminated the polio vaccine, and Eddy desperately tried to sound the alarm. Even though her previous warnings, if heeded, would have prevented the tragic Cutter Incident, she yet again was met with astonishing opposition.\n\nWhat happened next was tragic not only for Eddy herself, but it precipitated one of the worst medical blunders/conspiracies of the 20th century.\n\n[The Health Century](http://www.amazon.com/Health-Century-Edward-Shorter-Ph-D/dp/0385242360/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1397771618&sr=8-1&keywords=edward+shorter+health+century) by Edward Shorter offers the following account of [this story:](http://www.whale.to/v/eddy.html)\n\n>Sarah Stewart and Bernice Eddy's discovery of the polyoma in 1957 marked the real takeoff of theories about virus and cancer. It could be destructive like polio, but produce tumors at the same time.\n\n>At the same time in the late 1950s that Eddy and Stewart were producing cancers in animals with the polyoma virus, Eddy had sneaked back to the polio vaccine. \u201cI did things on the side which I wasn't assigned to do,\u201d  Eddy said. One of them was starting to conduct safety experiments on the polio vaccine in June 1959, from which she had officially been removed four years earlier.\n\n>In observing cells from the kidneys of rhesus monkeys under the microscope\u2014the kind of cell preparation from which the polio vaccine was being made by private drug companies\u2014Eddy had noted spontaneous degeneration, meaning that the cells would start to die without any apparent cause. \n\n>She did more experiments with these cells, and on July 6, 1960, reported to her chief [Joseph Smadel,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Edward_Smadel) that when she injected preparations from those monkey kidneys into hamsters, the hamsters got cancer. Tumors grew in newborn hamsters at the site of injection; probably a virus in the monkey cells was causing the cancer.\n\n>The story that follows is such a sad one, partly because Smadel himself was a distinguished scientist, not just a petty bureaucrat...he was not pleased, just after assuming his new post in viral research, when Eddy threw this time bomb onto his desk: the possibility of a cancer-causing virus in the polio vaccine. In August he sat down with Eddy, went over her data, and dismissed the findings as \u201clumps.\u201d\n\nEddy tried every possible means to alert her peers to the danger, and ultimately decided she would \u201csurprise\u201d a meeting of the Cancer Society with her findings.\n\n>The Eddy problem landed again on Smadel's desk when, in October of 1960, she gave a talk at the New York meeting of the Cancer Society. At the meeting she described finding a cancer-causing virus in the monkey cells from which the polio vaccine was grown. \n\n>Smadel hit the roof. \u201cSmadel called me up,\u201d Eddy said, \u201cand if there was anything in the English language\u2014any awful name\u2014that he could call me, he did. Oh, he was mad. I never saw anybody so mad.\u201d Smadel wrote Eddy a letter later that day forbidding her to speak in public again without clearing a written text of her remarks specifically with him. That was just the beginning.\n\n>Eventually, Bernice Eddy lost her labs. In successive measures she was denied permission to attend scholarly conferences, her papers were held up, and finally she was removed from vaccine research altogether. \n\n>Her treatment became a scandal within the scientific community and was discussed in Senate hearings.\n\nBernice Eddy came to a shocking conclusion: an entire generation had been given cancer-causing monkey viruses. Using this knowledge, she predicted a future epidemic of cancer.\n\n[Maurice Hilleman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Hilleman) and Benjamin Sweet came to similar conclusions. Sweet and Hilleman were pharmaceutical researchers for Merck and are credited with first identifying the virus as SV40, the 40th such simian virus discovered until that point. According to Hilleman:\n\n>The discovery of this new virus...raises the important question of the existence of other such viruses...As shown in this report, all three types of Sabin's live poliovirus vaccine, now fed to millions of persons of all ages, were contaminated with SV40.\n\nHilleman and Sweet noted the possibility that it [might cause cancer,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13774265) \u201cespecially when administered to human babies.\u201d [According to Sweet](http://www.vaccinationnews.com/DailyNews/June2001/PolioVaxSV40.htm):\n\n>It was a frightening discovery because, back then, it was not possible to detect the virus with the testing procedures we had....We had no idea of what this virus would do. First, we knew that SV40 had oncogenic (cancer-causing) properties in hamsters, which was bad news. Secondly, we found out that it hybridized with certain DNA viruses...such that [they] would then have SV40 genes attached [to them]....\n\n>When we started growing the vaccines, we just couldn't get rid of the SV40-contaminated virus. We tried to neutralize it, but couldn't....Now, with the theoretical links to HIV and cancer, it just blows my mind.\n\n[Further research](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/174424) uncovered even more disturbing information. \n\n>This cancer-causing virus was not only ingested via Sabin's contaminated oral sugar-cube vaccine, but was directly injected into people's bloodstreams as well. Apparently, [SV40 survived the formaldehyde Salk used](http://www.whale.to/vaccines/curtis.htm) to kill microbes that defiles his injectable vaccine.\n\nExperts have estimated that up to 100 million Americans and at least 100 millions others throughout the world were exposed to SV40 through the polio vaccine. [Bookchin, D., et al. \u201cTainted polio vaccine still carries its threat 40 years later. *The Boston Globe* (January 26, 1997)]\n\nEven though SV40 is universally acknowledged to cause cancer in animal models, strangely enough its role in causing cancer in humans is still debated. As Wikipedia explains:\n\n>The hypothesis that SV40 might cause cancer in humans has been a particularly controversial area of research. Several different methods have been used to detect SV40 in a variety of human cancers, although how reliable these detection methods are, and whether SV40 has any role in causing these tumors, remains unclear. \n\n>As a result of these uncertainties, academic opinion remains divided, with [some arguing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17131333) that this hypothesis is not supported by the data, and [others arguing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17483871) that some cancers [may involve](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16626046) SV40. \n\n>However, the United States National Cancer Institute announced in 2004 that although SV40 does cause cancer in some animal models, \u201csubstantial epidemiological evidence has accumulated to indicate that SV40 likely does not cause cancer in humans.\u201d\n\nAs the Wikipedia article points out, this is in contrast to a [2002 study](http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10534&page=66) conducted by The National Academy of Sciences Immunization Safety Review committee that declared, \u201cThe committee concludes that the biological evidence is moderate that SV40 exposure could lead to cancer in humans under natural conditions.\u201d",

By the early 1960s, it finally became understood that DDT was having a devastating impact on the environment and possibly human health.\n\n[DDT spraying](http://www.whale.to/vaccines/ddt_spraying.html) and [DDT delousing](http://www.whale.to/b/typhus_pic.html) were both extremely, and terrifyingly, common before this realization. \n\nIn 1953, Morton S. Biskind [published](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02883493) a damning report called \u201cPublic health aspects of the new insecticides.\u201d A decade before Rachel Carson would release her groundbreaking [*Silent Spring,*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Spring) Biskind was desperately trying to sound the alarm:\n\n>It was even known by 1945 that DDT is stored in the body fat of mammals and appears in the milk. With this foreknowledge the series of catastrophic events that followed the most intensive campaign of mass poisoning in known human history, should not have surprised the experts. \n\n>Yet, far from admitting a causal relationship so obvious that in any other field of biology it would be instantly accepted, virtually the entire apparatus of communication, lay and scientific alike, has been devoted to denying, concealing, suppressing, distorting and attempts to convert into its opposite, the overwhelming evidence. Libel, slander and economic boycott have not been overlooked in this campaign.\n\n>Dr. Biskind [had the composure to argue](http://www.whale.to/vaccine/west5a.html) what he thought was the most obvious explanation for the polio epidemic: Central nervous system diseases (CNS) such as polio are actually the physiological and symptomatic manifestations of the ongoing government- and industry-sponsored inundation of the world's populace with central nervous system poisons.\n\nBiskind emphasized physiological evidence of DDT poisoning that resembled polio physiology:\n\n>Particularly relevant to recent aspects of this problem are neglected studies by Lillie and his collaborators of the National Institutes of Health, published in 1944 and 1947 respectively, which showed that DDT may produce degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord in animals. These changes do not occur regularly in exposed animals any more than they do in human beings, but they do appear often enough to be significant.\n\n>He continues, bearing his exasperation in trying to make the obvious plain. \u201cWhen the population is exposed to a chemical agent known to produce in animals lesions in the spinal cord resembling those in human polio, and thereafter the latter disease increases sharply in incidence and maintains its epidemic character year after year, is it unreasonable to suspect an etiologic relationship?\u201d\n\n[A German study](http://books.google.com/books/about/Physiological_investigations_into_the_ac.html?id=1xkUAQAAIAAJ) of the physiology of acute DDT poisoning confirmed that DDT often causes polio-like physiology.\n\nBiskind's views fell into disfavor after the introduction of the polio vaccine, which \u201cproved\u201d to most that the majority of polio cases were caused by a virus. By 1955, Biskind, whose works had been published in established medical journals and who testified before the Senate on the dangers of pesticides, was forced self-publish his writings.\n\n##The Present Polio Predicament\n\nProblems with the polio vaccine continue today, for in February of 2014, a study was published [identifying a \u201cpolio-like\u201d illness](http://www.activistpost.com/2014/02/polio-like-illness-in-five-vaccinated.html) in five California children. \u201cAll children presented with acute flaccid paralysis of one or more limbs that reached peak severity within 48 hours of onset...All had been previously vaccinated against polio-virus.\u201d\n\n>What the Abstract authors may not know is that [47,500 cases of vaccine-induced polio paralysis followed an oral polio vaccination campaign](http://nsnbc.me/2013/05/08/bill-gates-polio-vaccine-program-caused-47500-cases-of-paralysis-death/) conducted by the GAVI Alliance, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the World Health Organization (WHO) in India in 2011.\n\nIncredibly, the oral polio vaccine was given to Indian children, despite the fact that in the U.S., the CDC had dropped the OPV from its vaccine schedule [*because it was causing polio.*](http://www.thinktwice.com/Polio.pdf)\n\nAccording to Neetu Vashisht and Jacob Puliyel at St. Stephens Hospital in Delhi:\n\n>The charade about polio eradication and the great savings it will bring has persisted to date. It is a paradox that while the director general of WHO and Bill Gates are trying to muster support for polio eradication *it has been known to the scientific community, for over 10 years, that eradication of polio is impossible.* \n\n>This is because in 2002 scientists had synthesized a chemical called poliovirus in a test-tube with the empirical formula C332,652H492,388N98,245O131,196P7, 501S2,340. It has been demonstrated that by positioning the atoms in sequence, a particle can emerge with all the properties required for its proliferation and survival in nature.\n\nVashisht and Puliyel [published their findings](http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/index.php/ijme/article/view/110/1065) in the *Indian Journal of Medical Ethics* and [\u201cshould have made headlines around the globe.\u201d](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/08/28/polio-eradication-campaign.aspx) They determined:\n\n>\u2026while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. \n\n>*Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received.* Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated. The principle of primum-non-nocere [First, do no harm] was violated.\n\nFor more information, [here's one of the best lectures on the subject of polio available on Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twch-T-n8Ns)  Suzanne Humphries, MD, speaks about the \u201cdisappearance\u201d of polio, and includes detailed information about the deceptive reclassification of \u201cpolio\u201d and the connection between the rampant use of DDT and polio-like disorders of the central nervous system.\n\nIf this brief overview doesn't already raise serious questions and concerns about the history of the polio vaccine, then strap yourselves in.",

Coxsackie virus infections and aseptic meningitis have been distinguished from poliomyelitis....Thus, simply by changes in diagnostic criteria, the number of paralytics cases was predetermined to decrease.\n\nSome have speculated that approximately [90% of polio cases were eliminated from statistics](http://www.whale.to/v/phillips.html) by health authorities\u2019 redefinition of the disease when the vaccine was introduced.

That's where all those 30,000 to 50,000 cases of polio disappeared after the introduction of mass vaccination.\n\nAccording to [proponents of this claim,](http://www.whale.to/vaccine/polio1.html) polio now \u201chides\u201d behind the following conditions: acute flaccid paralysis, transverse myelitis, viral or aseptic meningitis, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Chinese paralytic syndrome, spinal meningitis, inhibitory palsy, etc.\n\n>[The Los Angeles County health authorities stated:](http://www.theecologist.org/investigations/health/268596/polio_the_virus_and_the_vaccine.html) \u201cMost cases reported prior to July 1, 1958 of non-paralytic poliomyelitis are now reported as viral or aseptic meningitis.\u201d\n\n[In July 1955,](http://currenthealthscenario.blogspot.com/2012/08/polio-vaccine-neil-z-miller-part-2.html) before the new polio definition was introduced, there were 273 reported cases of polio in Los Angeles County, as compared to 50 reported cases of aseptic meningitis. \n\nIn July 1961, *after* the new definition was introduced, there were 65 cases of polio and 161 cases of aseptic meningitis.

Sabin's goal was to simulate a real-life infection.\n\n>This meant using an attenuated or weakened form of the live virus. He experimented with thousands of monkeys and chimpanzees before isolating a rare type of polio virus that would reproduce in the intestinal tract without penetrating the central nervous system. \n\n>The initial human trials were conducted in foreign countries.

[McBean, E. & Allen, H.]\n\n>For example, Vermont reported 15 cases of polio during the one-year report period ending August 30, 1954 (before mass inoculations), compared to 55 cases of polio during the one-year period ending August 30, 1955 (after mass inoculations)\u2014a  266% increase.\n\n>Rhode Island reported 22 cases during the before inoculations period as compared to 122 cases during the after inoculations period\u2014a 454% increase. \n\n>In New Hampshire the figures increased from 38 to 129; in Connecticut they rose from 144 to 276; and in Massachusetts they swelled 273 to 2027\u2014a whopping 642% increase. \n\nMany NIH doctors and scientists at the NIH during the 1950s were aware that Salk's vaccine was causing polio. \n\n>Some frankly stated that it was \u201cworthless as a preventive and dangerous to take.\u201d They refused to vaccinate their own children.

Muscular paralysis affects approximately one out of every 1,000 people who contract polio.\n\n>This has lead some scientific researchers to conclude that the small percentage of people who do develop paralytic polio may be anatomically susceptible to the disease. The vast remainder of the population may be naturally immune to the polio virus.

In contrast, polio was practically unheard of in China (with its sugar use of only 3 pounds per person per year).\n\nSandler claimed that sugars and starches lower blood sugar levels which leads to hypoglycemia.\n\n>Such food dehydrate the cells and leech calcium from the body. A serious calcium deficiency precedes polio. Researchers have always known that polio strikes with its greatest intensity during the hot summer months. \n\n>Dr. Sandler observed that children consume greater amounts of ice cream, soft drinks, and artificially sweetened products in hot weather. In 1949, before the polio season began, he warned the residents of North Carolina, through the newspapers and radio, to decrease their consumption of these products. \n\n>That summer, North Carolinians reduced their intake of sugar by 90%; polio decreased by the same amount! The North Carolina State Health Department reported 2,498 cases of polio in 1948 and 229 cases in 1949. [Data taken from North Carolina State Health Department figures]\n\n>One manufacturer shipped one million less gallons of ice cream during the first week alone following the publication of Dr. Sandler's anti-polio diet. Soft drink sales were down as well.\n\n>But powerful Rockefeller Milk Trust, which sold frozen products to North Carolinians, combined forces with soft drink business leaders and convinced the public that Sandler's findings were a myth and the polio figures a fluke. By the summer of 1950 sales were back to previous levels and polio cases returned to \u201cnormal.\u201d [[McBean, E.](http://www.amazon.ca/Poisoned-Needle-Eleanora-McBean/dp/0787305944/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1398114507&sr=1-1), [Allen, H.](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Stuck-Against-Vaccinations-Injections/dp/0914532332)]\n\nAs can be seen by [this graph of United States polio rates](http://htmlimg3.scribdassets.com/8425i20p4w258wzf/images/9-7e65fb9cad.jpg), polio epidemics became a serious problem in the late 1940s and early 1950s, although it never quite reached the levels of 1916 (when the epicenter of the epidemic was mere miles from a Rockefeller research lab that was experimenting with an extremely virulent strain of the polio virus). \n\nBy the early 1950s, [Jonas Salk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Salk) began experimenting with a possible polio vaccine. \n\n>In 1952, Salk combined three types of polio virus grown in cultures made from monkey kidneys. Using formaldehyde, he was able to \u201ckill\u201d or inactivate the viral matter so that it would trigger an antibody response without causing the disease.\n\nIn 1955, the first polio immunization campaign was launched in the United States. Almost immediately, it became clear that something was very wrong with the vaccine. In the end, 70,000 school children became seriously ill from Salk's vaccine\u2014the [infamous \u201cCutter Incident.\u201d](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutter_incident#The_Cutter_incident) \n\n>The mistake resulted in the production of 120,000 doses of polio vaccine that contained live polio virus. Of the children who received the vaccine, 40,000 developed abortive poliomyelitis. The Cutter incident was one of the worst pharmaceutical disasters in U.S. history.\n\nThe renowned surgeon [Alton Ochsner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Ochsner) even gave the vaccine to two of his grandchildren...one died and the other was paralyzed. \u201cApparently, Salk's killed-virus vaccine was not completely inactivated.\u201d",

However, it seems we may have put *too* much trust in the ever-increasing vaccine schedule to achieve this goal.\n\nThe problem was greatly compounded in the U.S. by the [1986 National Childhood Vaccination Injury Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act), which shockingly was meant \u201cto reduce the potential financial liability of vaccine makers due to vaccine injury claims.\u201d\n\nThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was subsequently created \u201cto provide a federal no-fault system for compensating vaccine-related injuries or death by establishing a claim procedure involving the United States Court of Federal Claims and special masters.\u201d\n\nIn other words, when the vaccine manufacturer makes a mistake, which has happened before and will happen again, you have to go to a special [vaccine court](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court) and you aren't even allowed to sue the manufacturer directly. Many countries other than the U.S. have similar arrangements.\n\nWithout the burden of possibly damaging litigation, this seems to remove an absolute incentive for safety and responsibility on the part of the manufacturers and their product.\n\nOne of the reasons that vaccine manufacturers should be held completely accountable is that contamination of vaccine stocks are disturbingly common, and this includes organisms such as [SIV,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian_immunodeficiency_virus) [mycoplasma,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma) [pestivirus,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pestivirus) [cytomegalovirus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus) and SV40.\n\n[SV40](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40) is of particular note, because millions worldwide were exposed to the cancer-causing virus beginning in 1955 as the result of contaminated polio vaccines. The story behind this tragedy is quite shocking and a more detailed account is included in the section on polio.\n\n[Studies by Michele Carbone](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3241931/) and others have demonstrated a profound link between SV40 virus from vaccines and mesotheliomas and osteosarcomas, as well as numerous types of brain tumors.\n\n>Simian virus 40 (SV40) is a DNA virus isolated in 1960 from contaminated polio vaccines, that induces mesotheliomas, lymphomas, brain and bone tumors, and sarcomas, including osteosarcomas, in hamsters. These same tumor types have been found to contain SV40 DNA and proteins in humans. \n\n>It appears unlikely that SV40 infection alone is sufficient to cause human malignancy, as we did not observe an epidemic of cancers following the administration of SV40-contaminated vaccines. However, it seems possible that SV40 may act as a cofactor in the pathogenesis of some tumors.\n\nOne of the most potent cocarcinogens with SV40 is asbestos. \n\n>SV40 and asbestos are cocarcinogens in causing mesothelioma in hamster and mice, and in causing malignant transformation of human primary mesothelial cells in tissue culture. In vitro and animal experiments showing cocarcinogenicity between SV40 and asbestos support this hypothesis.\n\nAlthough many countries quietly banned SV40 once news of the contamination was released in the 1960's, \u201can analysis presented at the Vaccine Cell Substrate Conference in 2004 suggested that vaccines used in the former Soviet bloc countries, China, Japan, and Africa, could have been contaminated up to 1980.\u201d And according to Carbone's analysis:\n\n>The high incidence of SV40 sequences in Italian specimens, for example, is probably linked to the fact that Italy is the only country in the Western world that used contaminated vaccines as late as 1999.\n\nCarbone and co-workers [also published a study in 1999](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10626798) claiming that current testing for SV40 was inadequate.\n\nIt has also been demonstrated that those infected with SV40 before 1963 have passed the virus to their offspring (vertical or transplacental transmission).\n\n>This is why vaccine proponents continue to cover this disaster up\u2014since knowledge of this mass contamination of tens of millions of unsuspecting people and future generations would devastate public trust in government health authorities and the sacrosanct vaccine program.\n\nThese fears were given some credibility when [the CDC recently removed the SV40 section on their website.](http://www.newssum.com/98-million-americans-received-polio-vaccine-contaminated-cancer-virus-596)\n\n>The CDC has quickly removed a page from their website admitting that more than 98 million Americans received one or more doses of polio vaccine within an 8-year span when a proportion of the vaccine was contaminated with a cancer-causing polyomavirus called SV40.\n\n>Michele Carbone, Assistant Professor of Pathology at Loyola University in Chicago, has recently isolated fragments of the SV40 virus in human bone cancers and in a lethal form of lung cancer called mesothelioma. He found SV40 in 33% of the osteosarcoma bone cancers studied, in 40% of other bone cancers, and in 60% of the mesothelioma lung cancers.\n\n>Dr. Michele Carbone openly acknowledged [HIV/AIDS was spread by the hepatitis B vaccine produced by Merck & Co. during the early 1970s.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edikv0zbAlU) It was the first time since the initial transmissions took place in 1972-74, that a leading expert in the field of vaccine manufacturing and testing has openly admitted the Merck & Co. liability for AIDS.\n\nAs for HIV, although much of the population is unaware of the SV40 scandal and its implications, many do remember the [contaminated haemophilia blood products](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contaminated_haemophilia_blood_products) tragedy that saw thousands of haemophiliacs infected with HIV and hepatitis C in the 1970's and 80's.\n\nPerhaps the most shocking thing about the episode was that the products *continued* to be sold [even when they were known to be contaminated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_VIII#Contamination_scandal):\n\n>Bayer sparked controversy by continuing to sell contaminated factor VIII after new heat-treated versions were available. Under FDA pressure, unheated product was pulled from US markets, but was sold to Asian, Latin American, and some European countries. The product was tainted with HIV, *a concern that had been discussed by Bayer and the FDA.*\n\nAccording to [Neil Miller](http://www.scribd.com/doc/11564541/CH-51-Vaccine-saftey-forward), this level of corruption often extends to the safety studies of the vaccines themselves.\n\n>Vaccine studies are often funded by pharmaceutical companies with a financial interest in the outcome. Lead authors of important studies that are used to validate the safety or efficacy of a vaccine are often beholden to the manufacturer in some way. They may own stock in the company or are paid by the manufacturer to travel around the country promoting their vaccines.\n\n>Lead authors may receive consultation fees, grants or other benefits from the drug maker that contravene ethical boundaries and compromise the integrity of the study. When studies of this magnitude are jeopardized, generations of people\u2014and society itself\u2014are placed at risk.\n\n>In some instances, study results may be preordained...tobacco companies used this very same ploy. They financed numerous bogus studies ostensibly \u201cproving\u201d that cigarettes didn't cause cancer. The real studies got lost in the muddle.\n\n>At the infamous Simpsonwood conference held in Norcross, Georgia, experts knew that mercury in vaccines was damaging children. They had irrefutable proof\u2014the very reason for convening the meeting. \n\n>However, instead of making this important information public, they hatched a plan to produce additional \u201cstudies\u201d that denied such a link. In fact, vaccine proponents had the audacity to claim in some of these papers that mercury in vaccines not only doesn't hurt children but that it actually benefits them!\n\nPerhaps one of the most important shortcomings of the vast majority of vaccine safety studies is the absence of the true double-blind study.\n\n>Another ploy used by vaccine proponents is to design studies comparing vaccinated people to other vaccinated people. Honest studies would compare them to an *unvaccinated* population. In addition, vaccine control groups rarely receive a true placebo, which should be a harmless substance.\n\n>For example, when the safety profile of a new vaccine is being tested, one group may receive the experimental vaccine made with aluminum while the \u201ccontrol\u201d group receives an injection of aluminum as well (rather than water or another harmless substance).\n\n>When vaccines are compared in this way, that is, to other substances that are capable of causing adverse reactions, the vaccine appears safer than it really is. Whenever this deceptive tactic is utilized, officially acknowledged adverse reactions to a vaccine may represent only a fraction of the true potential risks to the recipient.\n\nHowever, not all studies are skewed, for example [this 1999 study published by the British Medical Journal](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1116914/) showed a strong correlation between the haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine to rising rates of type 1 diabetes, concluding that \u201cthe potential risk of the vaccine exceeds the potential benefit.\u201d",

In early 2003, [the program was expanded](http://www.jwatch.org/jw200601100000001/2006/01/10/look-back-recent-smallpox-vaccination-program) to include civilians considered at high risk during a smallpox outbreak (mostly healthcare and emergency service workers). \n\n>Shortly thereafter, several vaccinated people experienced [serious adverse reactions](http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-249858.html), including heart problems. For example, [a Maryland woman died from a hearth attack](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nurse-vaccinated-for-smallpox-dies/) after being injected with the shot.\n\nThese reports compelled the CDC [to release a fact sheet](http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/pdf/cardiacrecentvaccinees.pdf) on the smallpox vaccine to address the many concerns, admitting, \u201cThere is evidence suggesting that smallpox vaccination may cause cases of heart inflammation (myocarditis), inflammation of the membrane covering the heart (pericarditis), and a combination of these two problems....Heart pain (angina) and heart attack have also been reported after smallpox vaccination.\u201d \n\nIn 2005, the *Journal of the American Medical Association* [published a study](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=201967) that assessed the safety of the government's program. The study documented nearly a thousand adverse events, including 85 hospitalizations (numerous cases of myocarditis or pericarditis), and three deaths. The report ends by suggesting:\n\n>Additional reduction of overall vaccinia adverse events might be achievable through study of cardiac and dermatological risk factors, a better understanding of vaccinia host-pathogen interaction, and development of a less reactogenic vaccinia vaccine.\n\nIn 2007, [a two-year-old and his mother were infected](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-03-17/news/0703170122_1_smallpox-vaccine-eczema-vaccinatum-vaccinia) with \u201ceczema vaccinatum\u201d  after the father, a U.S. army soldier, was recently vaccinated against smallpox. \n\nAlso in 2007, an experimental smallpox vaccine called ACAM2000 (made by Acambis) was declared safe and effective by the FDA, despite the fact that [clinical trials of this vaccine were halted](http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ACAM2000+Clinical+Trials.-a0115255261) three years earlier when several people developed myopericarditis after receiving the new vaccine.\n\nAccording to the FDA, [ACAM2000 is \u201cnearly as effective\u201d](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-05-15-4083799170_x.htm) as the older smallpox vaccine, Dryvax, and poses \u201csimilar risks of serious side effects.\u201d \n\nAs for Dryvax, the listed adverse reactions include autoinoculation (transfer of the virus to other parts of the body) affecting the face, nose, mouth, genitalia and rectum; infection of the eye resulting in blindness; post-vaccinal encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, encephalopathy, progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, neurological sequelae, and death.\n\nHowever, even while U.S. Homeland Security was contemplating mandating the smallpox vaccine, not every government official was convinced. For example, Tommy Thompson of Health and Human Services said his department had no plans for a mandatory vaccination program, citing horrendous side effects as the principal reason. [Neergaard, L. \u201cHealth officials review smallpox plan.\u201d *Associated Press* (October 19, 2001)]\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also opposed the idea, declaring that side effects were too numerous and too severe. [Stolberg, SG.]\n\nMany pediatricians can't distinguish between smallpox and chickenpox, according to [the results of a survey](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16528437) published in 2006 by *Clinical Pediatrics.*\n\n>Fifty-nine percent of the responders were unable to differentiate chickenpox from smallpox, and the majority would not accept vaccination in the absence of an outbreak and would not recommend smallpox vaccine to their patients. Even in previously vaccinated pediatricians, willingness to receive smallpox vaccine is poor...\n\nDespite the well-documented concerns about the safety of the smallpox vaccine and the threat (and loss of civil liberties) associated with mandatory vaccines, on October 23, 2001, the CDC unveiled new legislation, [The Model State Emergency Health Powers Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_State_Emergency_Health_Powers_Act), \u201cgiving public health officials and state governors the authority to arrest, vaccinate, medicate, and quarantine anyone they deem either unprotected from, or a threat to spread, infectious disease (see Section 504a\u2014Vaccination  and treatment).\u201d\n\n>Local police and the U.S. military, by way of the National Guard, would enforce the law. Previous laws permitting medical, religious, or philosophical exemptions would be repealed. \n\nIn response to this legislation, Dawn Richardson of PROVE, a vaccine awareness organization, declared: \n\n>Everyone who values our freedoms and rights in this country needs to commit to educating family and friends about the dangers of such an unchecked medical dictatorship. \n\n>Because there has been no research into the biological mechanisms that predispose people to vaccine reactions and there has been no effort to screen out these individuals, this type of action should be condemned; it will create unfathomable human suffering and sacrifice. [Richardson, D. \u201cDanger: forced vaccination for all under CDC's proposal.\u201d *PROVE newsletter* (November 2, 2001)]\n\nThis legislation also exempts the State, the police, and public health authorities from any liability. \u201cIf an individual opposes vaccines, is force-inoculated and dies, the perpetrators cannot be prosecuted.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU [also weighed in quite heavily](https://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/model-state-emergency-health-powers-act) against the MSEHPA.\n\nBecause of the increasing number of reported side effects, Congressman [Henry Waxman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_waxman) was forced to state the obvious: \u201cThe president has asked healthcare workers to volunteer to be immunized so that they can serve society. In turn, society should help them if they are hurt when they volunteer.\u201d\n\nIn response to these concerns, in 2006 the U.S. government published the \u201cfinal rules\u201d to the [Smallpox Vaccine Injury Compensation Program](http://archive.hrsa.gov/hrsa/smallpoxinjury/frn052406.htm). The goal was to provide \u201cbenefits to public health and medical response team members and others who are injured as a result of receiving the smallpox vaccine.\u201d \n\nAlso, \u201cunvaccinated individuals injured after coming into contact with a vaccinated member of an emergency response plan, or with a person with whom the vaccinated person had contact, or their survivors may be eligible for the same program benefits.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, Neil Miller offers a crude, but damning, summary of this alternative perspective of the history of smallpox and the smallpox vaccine:\n\n1. Being with unsanitary living conditions and poor nutritional awareness. This results in regional and self-limiting outbreaks of smallpox. \n\n2. Conduct human experiments with variolation\u2014the practice of inserting viral matter (infectious pus) from a smallpox victim into a deliberate cut on a healthy person.\n\n3. When this fails, conduct human experiments with cowpox, horsepox, and horsegrease cowpox. \n\n4. When this fails, deny it.\n\n5. When this fails, blame it on \u201cspurious\u201d cowpox, improperly administered injections, or too few puncture marks...and recommend re-vaccination. \n\n6. When this fails, manipulate statistics by altering medical records and falsifying death certificates...and *mandate* the smallpox vaccine.\n\n7. When people refuse the shot, vaccination rates drop, and cases of smallpox dwindle...take full credit for eradicating the disease!",

In September of 2000, one year before the terrorist attacks, [the CDC contracted with OraVax](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/26/business/26SMAL.html) (which changed its name to Acambis) to produce a new smallpox vaccine. \n\n>Some researchers were puzzled by these actions since smallpox was supposedly eradicated and authorities were debating whether to destroy all of the remaining seed stocks of the virus. According to Dr. Margaret Hamburg, of the Department of Health and Human Services, \u201cA lot of people thought this was a crazy idea, to make a new vaccine when the disease didn't exist.\u201d\n\nIn June 2001, *before* the 9/11 attacks, a team of bioterrorism specialists led by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies conducted a smallpox epidemic exercise ominously called [Dark Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Winter_%28biodefense_exercise%29). \n\n>Within two months after the hypothetical epidemic started, three million people were infected. Dark Winter ended with the collapse of interstate commerce, crowds rioting in the streets, and the nation moving towards martial law. \n\n>However, like any theoretical exercise, conclusions are predicated on the underlying assumptions. One key assumption was that each person with smallpox would infect at least 10 other people and that those 10 people would each infect at least 10 more people and so on.\n\n>But [a recent study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11747722) published in *Emerging Infectious Diseases* regards those infection rates as grossly unrealistic. The authors of the study looked at data from numerous smallpox outbreaks and reported that on average less than one person was infected per infectious person. \n\n>In all outbreaks, some infected persons did not transmit a single case of smallpox to another person. [The CDC researchers concluded](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2003/07/10/smallpox-attack-exaggerated/) \u201cthe probability that the average transmission rate will be greater than two cannot be demonstrated reliably.\u201d\n\nEven though the Dark Winter simulation was severely flawed, Dr. Henderson, the \u201cteam leader\u201d who also led WHO's global effort to eradicate smallpox, concluded that the threat was real and recommended 100 to 135 million doses. \n\nLess than 10 days after 9/11, Dick Cheney was shown a video of the Dark Winter simulation and urged to increase the production of smallpox vaccine. \n\n>On October 24, 2001, President Bush asked Congress for $509 million to develop and produce a new smallpox vaccine. He solicited bids for the job from several pharmaceutical companies, insisting on 300 million doses\u2014one dose for every American\u2014within the shortest possible time, not to exceed one year.\n\nThe new vaccine [was expected to be made from](http://prospect.org/article/smallpox-wars-1) a \u201cdiploid cell substrate\u201d (human embryo) or from animal tissue cell cultures, including those with \u201ctumorigenic potential.\u201d\n\n>Ideally, it would not cause adverse reactions, would not be dangerous to people with immune system deficiencies, and would have the capacity to defeat genetically altered strains of variola. But researchers provided no evidence that the new vaccine would cause fewer adverse reactions than the old vaccine.\n\n>Furthermore, [experts were very concerned](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12496351) about \u201cthe transmissibility of vaccinia virus from a recently vaccinated person to a susceptible host.\u201d In other words, some people\u2014no one knows how many\u2014will develop smallpox by coming into contact with a recently vaccinated person.\n\nFranklin Top, a biotechnology expert and previous commander of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, declared that \u201creactogenicity\u201d [is going to be a problem.](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/294/5542/498.summary)\n\nDr. Mark Buller, a virologist specializing in safer smallpox treatments at St. Louis University, boldly pronounced: \u201cI would not even consider having my family vaccinated. I'm more likely to be hit riding my bike to work than be hit by a smallpox episode in my own life. [Stolberg, SG. \u201cImmunization: vast uncertainty on smallpox vaccine.\u201d *New York Times* (October 19, 2001)]\n\n>Potential vaccine recipients must also understand that scientists may never be able to create a vaccine that can protect against mutated strains of the virus. Dozens of strains already exist. New permutations of the variola microbe could be developed by bioterrorists rendering a new vaccine worthless, thus subjecting recipients of the shot to the inherent risk of serious adverse reactions without the expected benefit.\n\n>In 2002, the U.S. government tested their existing smallpox vaccine on 200 \u201cfit and healthy\u201d college students. Following vaccination, 75 had high fevers, one-third missed at least one day of work or school, and several were put on antibiotics because their blisters resembled a bacterial infection.\n\n>Dr. Kathy Edwards, the physician overseeing the study, [commented on the side effects:](http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/smallpoxvacjoltsexperts.html) \u201cI can read all day about it, but seeing it is quite impressive.

[When the report was buried,](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0246.009) he contacted the *Times.*\n\nThe regions that received the most vaccinations coincided with the areas of the greatest outbreaks of AIDS, including Zaire, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawai, Ruanda, and Burundi. Brazil had the highest AIDS rates in South Africa, and they were the only country including in the smallpox vaccination campaign on the entire continent.\n\nAccording to the WHO advisor, \u201cI thought it was just a coincidence until we studied the latest findings about the reactions which can be caused by vaccinia. Now I believe the smallpox vaccination theory is the explanation of AIDS.\u201d\n\n[Dr. Robert Gallo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gallo), a pioneering AIDS/HIV researcher, when confronted with this disturbing scenario, did little to alleviate anyone's fears: \u201cI have been saying for some years that the use of live vaccines such as that used for smallpox can activate a dormant infection such as HIV.\u201d\n\n[Recent research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1088484/pdf/TB010911.pdf) has also shown that unsterile injections may have done a great deal in contributing to the HIV epidemic in Africa: \u201cWe conclude that increased unsterile injecting in Africa during the period 1950-1970 provided the agent for SIV human infections to emerge as epidemic HIV in the modern era.\u201d\n\nDid an attempt to control one disease, smallpox, transform another disease, AIDS, \u201cfrom a minor endemic illness of the Third World into the current pandemic?\u201d\n\n##Monkeypox\n\n>Some researchers question whether smallpox was ever truly exterminated. After WHO launched its global vaccination campaign against variola in 1967, [suspected cases of smallpox were labeled as monkeypox](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1588514/).\n\n*Lancet* [published a report in 1972](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4117382) that stated that WHO's program to eradicate smallpox \u201ccan only be successful in the absence of a non-human reservoir for smallpox virus.\u201d \n\n>However, the author of the report identified several poxviruses affecting both humans and animals, and conceded that *the monkeypox virus can cause clinical smallpox in humans.*\n\nIn 1976, monkeypox antibodies in humans [were discovered in Nigeria and the Ivory Coast.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/186210) The monkeypox virus was indistinguishable by laboratory methods from the smallpox virus.\n\n>Orthopoxviruses, the genera to which vaccinia, variola, cowpox, and monkeypox belong, have a high degree of similarity, with a \u201cpropensity for genetic recombination.\u201d Monkeypox and smallpox produce exact clinical symptoms, with one insignificant difference: monkeypox also causes swelling of the cervical and inguinal (groin) lymph nodes.\n\n>In 1979, [new research indicated](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/225049) that several animal species, including some rodents, may be carriers of variola-like viruses virtually identical to cowpox and monkeypox viruses. In fact, several poxviruses from animal sources were tested and [shown to behave like variola/smallpox viruses.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6982773)\n\n>Scientists are \u201cwondering whether the specter of smallpox might be rising form the dead, perhaps reincarnated in its close relative monkeypox, which is alive, well, and spreading in Central Africa.\u201d According to Dr. Peter Jahrling of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, for all practical purposes, smallpox is back.

In 1915, the U.S. Department of Agriculture linked several foot-and-mouth disease epidemics to the smallpox vaccine. [U.S. Department of Agriculture. *Farmer's Bulletin* (April 22, 1915):15]\n\nIn the mid-1920's, Great Britain authorized the [Andrews and then the Rolleston Committee](http://wwwwwwwww.whale.to/v/charles_forward.html) to study post-vaccinal encephalitis and deaths resulting from the smallpox vaccination.\n\n>*The contents of this Report were of so damaging a character that it was deemed advisable to withhold it from publication.* In this (the Rolleston) Report ninety-three cases of post-vaccinal encephalitis with fifty-one deaths are stated to have occurred between Nov., 1922, and Sept., 1927, and in a subsequent Report (Cmd. 3738), covering the three following years, there are recorded a further ninety cases with forty-two deaths. \n\nAmong the \u201cdamaging\u201d results from these reports were that young adults vaccinated against smallpox were five times more likely to die from the disease than the un-vaccinated! It's no wonder that many respectable institutions were beginning to question Jenner and his legacy.\n\n>The indisposition of the authorities to admit any awkward facts telling against vaccination is a feature in the history of Jennerism. Thus, until 1911 it was the practice to tabulate deaths following vaccination under the heading\u2014\u201cCowpox and other Effects of Vaccination.\u201d \n\n>At the date referred to a new heading, \u201cVaccinia,\u201d was introduced...five deaths, all of infants, which would in former years have been assigned to the effects of vaccination, appear under the respective headings of erysipelas, pyaemia, septicaemia, convulsions, and phlegmon. \n\n>Possibly the Registrar-General could offer some reason for altering the practice of thirty years, but the effect, none the less, is to exonerate vaccination by attributing death to secondary causes instead of to the primary cause\u2014vaccination.\n\n>In May 1926, the *New York State Journal of Medicine* [reported on](http://explorevaccines.wordpress.com/2008/12/10/encephalitis-part-2/) several cases of encephalitis and meningitis that developed shortly after smallpox vaccinations.\n\n>In July of that year, the *Journal of American Medical Association* found correlations between smallpox vaccinations and nervous disturbances. The authors noted: \u201cIn regions in which there is no organized vaccination of the population, general paralysis is rare. It is impossible to deny a connection between\nvaccination and the encephalitis which follows it.\u201d\n\nIn September 1926, *Lancet* published data confirming seven cases of encephalomyelitis following smallpox vaccinations. The authors, Turnbull and McIntosh, declared: \u201cThere can be no doubt that vaccination was a definite causal factor.\u201d \n\nThe next month *Lancet* reported on 35 cases of encephalitis, including 15 deaths. The authors concluded: \u201cVaccination was a definite causal factor and no chance coincidence.\u201d\n\nIn 1928, the League of Nations issued a report that noted, \u201cThe post-vaccinal encephalitis with which we are dealing has become a problem in itself...Their occurrence has led to the realization that a new, or at least a previously unsuspected or unrecognized, risk attaches to the practice of vaccination.\u201d \n\n>The Report also noted 139 recent cases of post-vaccinal encephalitis and 41 deaths in one country alone, Holland. Compulsory smallpox vaccinations were discontinued as a result. [Health Organization of the League of Nations: Geneva. \u201cReport of the Commission of Smallpox and Vaccination,\u201d (August 27, 1928)]\n\n>In February 1930, Germany modified its compulsory vaccination law following numerous cases of post-vaccinal diseases: \u201cVaccinated people developed a cerebral inflammation which resulted in a number of deaths and several cases of mental derangement.\u201d [*The International News Service* (February 27, 1930)]\n\nLater that year, the *Journal of the American Medical Association* reported on several fatal reactions among children following smallpox vaccination. They were described as having \u201cencephalitic symptoms.\u201d [*J of the American Medical Association* (April 5, 1930)]\n\n>From 1949 to 1951, in the United States, people died from complications of the smallpox vaccine\u2014mainly from post-vaccinal encephalitis\u2014at rates eight times greater than those who were not vaccinated.\n\nIn December of 1952, *Lancet* published a study documenting the reaction of a woman who was three months pregnant to the vaccine: \u201cShe developed a severe primary reaction and three months later she was spontaneously delivered of a feeble hydropic premature infant covered with a very severe generalized vaccinia. The child died 18 hours later.\u201d\n\nAnother study determined that 47% of women who were vaccinated during their first trimester failed to give birth to a normal child. [McBean, E., pg. 82.]\n\n>During the late 1950s and 1960s, several medical and scientific publications documented numerous cases of post-vaccinal encephalomyelitis following smallpox vaccination. Neurological reactions ranged from encephalitis to epilepsy, polyneuritis, multiple sclerosis, and death.\n\n>In some regions of the world, 1 of every 63 people vaccinated was damaged by the shot. Extreme sensitivity to multiple shots was also observed. Subsequent inoculations were responsible for many of the post-vaccinal ailments. In fact, the death rate from vaccination appeared greatest in those who were vaccinated early in life and then re-vaccinated in later years. The morbidity and mortality rates were extremely high in babies as well.\n\nThese statements come from multiple sources, including:\n\nMiller, H. et al.

[Ibid., pg. 13]\n\nThe German Chancellor himself opined, \u201cThe hopes placed in the efficacy of the cowpox virus as a preventative of smallpox have proved entirely deceptive.\u201d\n\n>From 1887 to 1889, countless Italian citizens contracted smallpox after Italy enforced mandatory shots; thousands died. According to Dr. Charles Dauta, Professor of Hygiene and Materia Medica at the University of Perugia, \u201cItaly is one of the best vaccinated countries in the world....For 20 years before 1885, our nation was vaccinated in the proportion of 98.5%....The epidemics of smallpox that we have had [from 1887 to 1889] have been so frightful that nothing before the invention of vaccination could equal them.\u201d [\u201cVaccination in Italy,\u201d *NY Med J* (July 22, 1899)]\n\nOver a twenty year period beginning in 1886, thousands of Japanese citizens died and hundreds of thousands were infected with smallpox after Japan enforced mandatory shots every five years. [Shelton, HM. [*Vaccine and Serum Evils*](http://www.whale.to/vaccines/shelton3.html) (San Antonio Texas; Health research, 1966):20-21]\n\nIn 1918 and 1919, after the US took control of the Philippines, mandatory smallpox vaccination was enforced. Thousands died after the entire population was vaccinated. A 1920 Report of the Philippines Health Services declared, \u201cThe 1918 epidemic looks prima facie as a flagrant failure of the classic immunization.\u201d [Ibid., pg. 22]\n\nOnce the connection between mass vaccination and the increase in epidemic became more apparent, several countries rescinded the mandatory vaccination laws and even outlawed the practice completely.\n\nThe Secretary of the Governing Board in Dublin, Ireland, declared, \u201cSmallpox virus taken from the calf would communicate that disease to the human subject and be thereby a fertile source of propagating the disease, and would, moreover, render the operator liable to prosecution under the Act prohibiting inoculation with smallpox.\u201d [White, W., pg. xxi.]\n\nAustralia abolished compulsory vaccinations in the late 1800's, and proceeded to report only 3 cases of smallpox in 15 years. Statistics from England and Wales show an inverse correlation between the percentage of babies vaccinated and the number of smallpox deaths: the greater the number vaccinated, the greater the loss. Deaths from smallpox tumbled after people refused the vaccine. [Official statistics from England and Wales, as reported by Shelton, HM., pg. 22]\n\n>By the mid-1850's, a very large anti-vaccine movement had been established. After the 1870-1872 smallpox epidemic, thought to have been caused by mandatory shots, this movement gained credibility and became more organized in its efforts to resist compulsory laws and awaken others to the inherent dangers of smallpox vaccinations.\n\n>In 1878, Mary Catherine Hume published *150 Reasons for Disobeying the Vaccination Law by Persons Prosecuted Under It.* Parents were being fined a jailed for refusing to submit their children to the shots. \n\n>Before the Exemption Act was passed in 1907, every year thousands of parents were prosecuted for resisting vaccination. Many had their homes and property confiscated. Hume's book advocated civil disobedience despite the punitive efforts of pro-vaccinators.\n\nIn 1884, a massive collection of smallpox data was published by the London Society for the Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination, containing \u201cunbiased vaccine statistics, newspaper stories about people who were damaged by the shot, and legal briefs regarding compulsory laws.\u201d\n\n>Despite harsh laws, many people refused to be vaccinated and would not allow their children to receive the shots. According to Lord Bramwell, \u201cIt is a most mischievous thing that there should be a law in existence which good people are tempted to disobey. It is a bad example to set, and it tends to bring laws into contempt which are of real importance.\u201d \n\nEven Mahatma Gandhi, although by no means a scientist, would eventually weigh in on the vaccine debate: \u201cI am and have been for years, a confirmed anti-vaccinationist...I have not the least doubt in my mind that vaccination is a filthy process that is harmful in the end.\u201d [Gandhi, MK. *Gandhi an Autobiography: Story of My Experiments With Truth* (Boston: Beacon PR., 1957)]",

            "body": "##Smallpox Shenanigans\n\n[Smallpox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox) is caused by the variola virus. You can catch smallpox through infected blankets or clothing, or by inhaling droplets discharged from the nose and mouth of an infected person. \n\nWithin 12 days after exposure, those infected will experience fever, nausea, vomiting, headache, backache, and muscle pains. This is soon followed by severe abdominal pain and a subsequent rash develops on the entire body. The rash then transforms into pus-filled sores which eventually crust over and may leave scars. The disease almost always confers permanent immunity.\n\nThere are different forms of smallpox (variola major, variola minor, fulminating, malignant, modified, etc.) and some are more serious than others. According to the WHO, case-fatality rate can reach 20% or higher. By 1980 the WHO declared [that smallpox had been eradicated](http://books.google.com/books/about/The_global_eradication_of_smallpox.html?id=SCmFQgAACAAJ).\n\nAlthough the WHO was quick to give credit to their own worldwide vaccination campaign begun in 1967, variola [had already stopped infecting people](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10721355) in more than 8 out of 10 countries throughout the world. At that time, only 131,000 cases of smallpox were reported. According to Neil Miller:\n\n>Some medical historians question the validity of [the WHO's] claim. Scarlet fever and the plague also infected millions of people. *Vaccines were never developed for these diseases yet they disappeared as well.* Several reputable historians credit *multiple* public health activities\u2014sanitation and nutrition reforms\u2014with reducing the incidence and severity of the early problematic diseases, including smallpox, scarlet fever, dysentery, typhoid, and cholera.\n\nThe history of [smallpox inoculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox_vaccine) is important to get an understanding of the history of vaccination, and not just because this story explains how the word \u201cvaccine\u201d was derived.\n\nBy the 1700s, it was known that contracting smallpox would give you immunity later in life. Some doctors even intentionally exposed people to smallpox hoping to provoke a less severe reaction and still confer immunity. Children were even exposed to pus extracted from \u201cmild\u201d cases of smallpox, a [technique known as variolation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9341063).\n\nIn 1715, [Peter Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox_vaccine#cite_ref-11) suggested collecting smallpox fluid and introducing it to the patient through a scratch in the skin. This technique would become the model for future applications and research.\n\n>It quickly became customary for the upper and middle classes to submit to the procedure. But it was an uncertain and hazardous practice. Often, smallpox by variolation was indistinguishable from an attack of ordinary smallpox. Moreover, it rarely conferred permanent immunity; the variolated could contract the disease more than once.\n\n>The trouble and risks of variolation were disliked and feared but were accepted in the name of duty. The variolated often died from the procedure, became the source of a new epidemic, or developed other illnesses from the lymph of the donor, such as syphilis hepatitis or tuberculosis. \n\n>Variolation spread throughout England, Europe, Canada, and the American colonies. However, the primary side effect of the procedure was smallpox itself. This caused researchers to seek alternatives to the dangerous and uncertain medical technique. \n\nIn 1774, [Benjamin Jesty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Jesty) set out to prove that [cowpox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowpox) infection protected against smallpox. Apparently, there was a rumor in England among 18th century dairymaids that when you catch cowpox, a relatively harmless disease, you would become immune to smallpox.\n\nJesty took diseased matter from cows and \u201cvaccinated\u201d his wife and sons (cowpox is also referred to as the vaccinia virus). Supposedly, no one in his family contracted smallpox during later epidemics, although his wife almost lost her arm as the result of a severe inflammation, rousing the ire of his peers for experimenting on his own family.\n\nEnter [Edward Jenner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Jenner), an English physician whose work Wikipedia dubiously refers to as having \u201csaved more lives than the work any other human.\u201d Apparently, no credit is due to the 18th century milkmaids, or even Jesty, who \u201cunlike Edward Jenner, a medical doctor who is given broad credit for developing the smallpox vaccine in 1796, did not publicize his findings made some twenty years earlier in 1774.\u201d\n\n>Jenner made a deliberate cut on James Phipps, a healthy 8-year-old boy, and inserted cowpox matter into the open wound. The boy caught cowpox. Seven weeks later, Jenner injected smallpox matter into the boy and claimed he was immune to the disease. \n\n>Jenner's medical colleagues disputed his claim that cowpox protected against smallpox: \u201cWe know that it is untrue, for we know dairymaids who have had cowpox and afterwards had smallpox.\u201d [White, W. *The Story of a Great Delusion: In a Series of Matter-of-Fact Chapters* (London: EW. Allen, 1885): xi.]\n\n>Soon thereafter, even Jenner admitted: \u201cThere were were not wanting instances to prove that when the cowpox broke out among the cattle at a dairy, a person who had milked an infected animal and had thereby apparently gone through the disease in common with other, was liable to receive the smallpox afterwards.\u201d [Harding Rains, AJ. [*Edward Jenner and Vaccination*](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0850781183?*Version*=1&*entries*=0) (East Hussex, England: Wayland Publishers, 1974):59]\n\nDespite facing a good deal of opposition, Edward Jenner continued his experiments and in 1798 he published his *Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae,* a \u201cvulgar treatise\u201d on horsegrease cowpox.\n\n>He knew of men who milked cows soon after dressing the heels of horses afflicted with \u201cthe grease,\u201d an oily and detestable horse disease. Jenner now insisted that *these* men were immune to smallpox, and that children would forever be protected from the disease if they were injected with cowpox after the cow was infected with the rancid secretions from horses' heels.\n\n>Jenner published *Inquiry* in order to recommend horsegrease cowpox. He carefully discriminated it from plain cowpox, which, he admitted, had no protective virtue.\n\n>The public was appalled by Jenner's recommendations. Still, many attempts were made to verify Jenner's prescription for protecting children; every experiment ended in failure. Jenner's peers were pleased to learn of his failures. One commented: \u201cThe very name of horsegrease was like to have damned the whole practice of vaccinations.\u201d\n\n>This may have been why, in 1806, when the esteemed [Dr. Robert Willan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Willan) published *On Vaccine Inoculation,* a treatise on the most recent developments in the field, Jenner was freely cited, yet neither horsegrease nor horsegrease cowpox was ever mentioned. Instead, plain cowpox was exalted as the true prophylactic.\n\nJenner continued to promote his nauseating treatment and as a result of his petitions to the House of Commons in 1802 and 1807, mass inoculation campaigns began.\n\n>Soon thereafter cases of smallpox among the vaccinated were reported. At first they were denied. When denial was no longer possible\u2014because the vaccinated were obviously afflicted with the disease\u2014Jenner and his supporters claimed that if vaccination did not prevent smallpox, it at least provoked milder forms of the disease.\n\n>But when the vaccinated caught the disease and *died,* new explanations became necessary. These deaths were attributed to \u201cspurious\u201d cowpox. [Miller, G., ed., *To Doctor Alexander J.G. Marcet, London, 11 November 1801, Letters of Edward Jenner and Other Documents concerning the Early History of Vaccination (London, England: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1983):13]\n\n>Jenner explained that \u201cthe disease produced upon the cows by the colt and from thence conveyed to those who milked them was the *true* and not the *spurious* cowpox.\u201d According to Jenner, protection from smallpox is not possible \u201cuntil a disease has been generated by the morbid matter from the horse on the nipple of the cow, and passed through that medium to the human subject.\u201d \n\n>However, it was virtually impossible to discriminate between the apparently different forms of cowpox. Thus, when the vaccinated recovered from the ordeal, Jenner claimed the cowpox was genuine; otherwise it was spurious!\n\nWikipedia's bold statement seems to be losing some of its bite, for Jenner even admitted that his \u201cgift\u201d caused disease and death: \u201cThe happy effects of inoculation...not very unfrequently produces deformity of the skin, and sometimes, under the best management, proves fatal.\u201d He tried to blame the failures on improper inoculations, an excuse that would continue to be used in the years following his death in 1823.\n\nBy that time, three kinds of smallpox vaccination were being used, cowpox (promoted as \u201cpure lymph from the calf\u201d), horsepox (known as \u201cthe true and genuine life-preserving fluid\u201d) and horsegrease cowpox, the \u201cfoul concoction\u201d promoted in Jenner's *Inquiry.* All were known to cause disease and death.\n\nAfter Jenner's deaths, vaccine failures continued to be blamed on improperly administered inoculations. Soon, two or more punctures were recommended, with some doctors claiming that a \u201cgood vaccination\u201d required *four* punctures. \n\nEven though there is no evidence that the number of puncture marks influenced the success of the practice, medical authorities at the time suggested that people be vaccinated again and again \u201cuntil vesicles cease to respond to the insertion of the virus.\u201d [White, W., pg. xxiii.]",

Since measles death rates are higher in Third World countries, [authorities decided to create a \u201chigh-titer\u201d vaccine](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199003013220903#t=articleTop) to target this 5-9 month age range.\n\n[Beginning in the 1980s,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6148572) they tested the Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ-HT) strain on Mexican and [Gambian babies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2902264) 4-6 months old.\n\nThe same high-titer vaccine continued to be administered in [Guinea-Bissau](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11228365), [Togo](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=tidjani+serological+effects+edmonston-zagreb), [Senegal](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1681265), [Bangladesh](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=khanum+comparison+edmonston-zagreb), Haiti, and [impoverished minority communities in Los Angeles, California.](http://whale.to/vaccines/awadu.html)\n\nThe public was told that EZ-HT \u201cproduces a better immunological response than standard vaccines,\u201d but studies had been conducted that concluded the vaccine was unsafe for infants, including the following: [Child mortality after high-titre measles vaccines: prospective study in Senegal.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1681265)\n\nThe study concluded, quite unequivocally, that \u201cThe higher risk of death in the two high-titre vaccine groups remained significant in multivariate analyses. These findings suggest a need to reconsider the use of high-titre measles vaccines early in life in less developed countries.\u201d\n\n>From 1987 to 1989, scientists set up a research center near 30 remote villages in central Senegal. Their stated primary objective was to study the clinical efficacy of two high-titer measles vaccines: Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ-HT) and Schwartz (SW-HT).\n\n>Researchers may have suspected the vaccine was dangerous when the results of earlier studies began to filter in. But they were probably reluctant to abandon their high-titer shot without testing it at least one more time to be sure. Senegal must have seemed ideal; the region was extremely remote, and less than 4% of the mothers who \u201cconsented\u201d to the study were literate.\n\n>When the results were tabulated (using eight statistical procedures) it became clear that children who received the high-titer measles vaccines had significantly higher mortality rates at 41 months than children in the standard low-titer measles vaccine group.\n\n>But they were not dying from measles. *Most of the deaths were from other common childhood diseases.* Apparently, [the high-titer measles vaccines lowered overall immunity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1681265) making the children fatally susceptible to diarrhea, dysentery, malaria, malnutrition, acute respiratory ailments, and other infectious diseases. \n\nBabies who received SW-HT died at a rate that was *51%* higher than those who received the standard vaccine...nearly 50 excess deaths for every 1000 babies vaccinated. EZ-HT was much more potent, contributing to a rate that was *80%* higher, contributing to 75 excess deaths for every 1000.\n\nStrikingly, according to the previously cited study published by *Lancet* in 1991, *1 in every 6 babies vaccinated with EZ-HT died within three years.* Unfortunately, even this didn't deter enthusiasts of the high-titer shot.\n\n>Vaccine researchers were unwilling to abandon their deadly Edmonston-Zagreb high-titer measles vaccine. Instead, they set up a study base in Los Angeles, California. In 1990, three years after the Senegal study was initiated, the first american Black and Hispanic babies [were injected with EZ-HT](http://whale.to/vaccines/awadu.html). [Awadu, KO. *Outrage! How Babies Were Used as Guinea Pigs in an L.A. County Vaccines Experiment.* (Long Beach, CA: Conscious Rasta Press, 1996)]\n\nEven though the WHO and the CDC knew about the high mortality rate already being associated with the vaccine, they [still considered the data \u201cpreliminary.\u201d](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1329205)\n\n>From 1989 to 1991, Kaiser Permanente along with the L.A. County Department of Health and the CDC, injected over 700 \u201cmostly minority\u201d babies with unlicensed experimental vaccines with fraudulently-obtained consent from the parents. Until Los Angeles county, this killer vaccine had only been used in the \u201cThird World.\u201d\n\nBefore the trials finished, nearly 1500 minority babies had been given the experimental vaccine, according to [this 1996 *LA Times* article](http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-17/news/mn-15871_1_measles-vaccine):\n\n>\u201dA mistake was made,\u201d said Dr. David Satcher, director of the Atlanta-based federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one of the study sponsors. \u201cIt shocked me.\u201d Satcher said in an interview that the CDC plans to contact all the families involved. He said he was very concerned that the events not fuel suspicion in the minority community of government-sponsored medical research.\n\nWe now know that the CDC lied about the study on numerous occasions.\n\n1. The \u201cinformed consent\u201d form provided to parents violated internationally accepted ethical codes of conduct regulating human experimentation. Parents were not informed that EZ-HT was unlicensed in the US.\n\n2. Parents were told that millions of doses of EZ-HT had been used in Europe. But the LA babies were actually receiving a vaccine that was up to *500* times more potent.\n\n3. The CDC said the communities targeted for the vaccine were those hit hardest by recent measles outbreaks. According to data obtained from the Los Angeles County Department of Health, these communities were *not* the hardest hit. Journalist Keidi Obi Awadu, in his *Outrage!*, documented that \u201cthree three regions chosen to receive the experimental shots were predominantly Black and Hispanic.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cseveral mixed-race and White communities harder hit by the recent outbreak of measles were not chosen to participate in the study.\u201d\n\n4. Although the CDC claimed no children were adversely affected, one baby did die from a rare bacterial disease. According to Awadu, several children \u201cexperienced what parents are describing as long-term immune system impairment, seizures and other acute conditions consistent with vaccine-induced injury.\u201d\n\n5. Stephen Hadler of the CDC claimed the babies died in earlier studies because they didn't have access to adequate health care. However, one of the more important findings of the Senegal study was \u201cthe three vaccine groups were comparable as regards various social, family, and health characteristics. Intensive medical care was provided during the project.\u201d\n\n>In 1990, WHO requested 250 million doses of the deadly EZ-HT measles vaccine to be dispensed throughout the world. However, data from Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, and Haiti continued to confirm that EZ-HT doesn't save lives\u2014it increases mortality. By June of 1992, the link was irrefutable; WHO called for a moratorium on use of the disputed vaccine. By some estimates, this may have prevented 18 million baby deaths. [Awadu]",

Numerous studies throughout the 80's and 90's documented the progress of these experiments, including:\n\n[\u201cPhase 1 clinical trials of a World Health Organization birth control vaccine,\u201d](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2453766) *Lancet* (June 11th, 1988): 1295-98. \n\n\u201cVaccines for fertility regulation,\u201d *Research in Human Reproduction, Biennial Report: 1986-87* (Geneva: WHO Special Programme of Research, 1988); chapter 11, pp. 177-198.\n\n[\u201cAnti-hCG vaccines are in clinical trials.\u201d](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1514026) *Scandinavian Journal of Immunology* 1992;36:123-126.\n\nhCG refers to [Human chorionic gonadotropin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCG), a hormone that stops menstruation and prepares the uterus for pregnancy. They theorized that if anti-hCG antibodies could be induced, then fertilization would remain incomplete.\n\nIn the mid 1990s, Human Life International (HLI) became suspicious of a WHO tetanus vaccination campaign in countries like the Philippines, Mexico and Nicaragua. WHO had developed a \u201cneonatal tetanus\u201d vaccine and began distributing it in numerous Third World countries in the early 1990s. \n\nNeonatal tetanus is extremely rare in developing countries, but it continues to be a concern in Third World regions because of the lack of proper sanitation.\n\n[According to J.A. Miller, correspondent for Human Life International](http://educate-yourself.org/vcd/vcdvaccineslacedwithbirthcontrol.shtml) (HLI Reports, Human Life International, Gaithersburg, Maryland; June/July 1995, Volume 13, Number 8):\n\n>In October 1994, HLI received a communication from its Mexican affiliate, the Comite' Pro Vida de Mexico, regarding that country's anti-tetanus campaign. Suspicious of the campaign protocols, the Comite' obtained several vials of the vaccine and had them analyzed by chemists. Some of the vials were found to contain *human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)*, a naturally occurring hormone essential for maintaining a pregnancy.\n\n>When introduced into the body coupled with a tetanus toxoid carrier, antibodies will be formed not only against tetanus but also against hCG. In this case the body fails to recognize hCG as a friend and will produce anti-hCG antibodies. The antibodies will attack subsequent pregnancies by killing the hCG which naturally sustains a pregnancy; when a woman has sufficient anti-hCG antibodies in her system, she is rendered incapable of maintaining a pregnancy.\n\n>HLI reported the sketchy facts regarding the Mexican tetanus vaccines to its World Council members and affiliates in more than 60 countries. Soon additional reports of vaccines laced with hCG hormones began to drift in from the Philippines, where more than 3.4 million women were recently vaccinated. Similar reports came from Nicaragua, which had conducted its own vaccination campaign in 1993.\n\nHere are several key points raised by HLI concerning the WHO tetanus vaccination program:\n\n1. Only *women* between the ages of 15 and 45 were vaccinated (in Nicaragua the age range was 12-49). Young children and men were excluded.\n\n2.  Not only did the vaccines contain human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), but the vaccination protocols called for multiple injections: three within three months and a total of five altogether. Tetanus vaccinations allegedly provide protection for ten years or more...why multiple injections?\n\n3. Since the 1970's, WHO has been researching development of an anti-fertility vaccine utilizing hCG tied to tetanus toxoid as a carrier...the exact same coupling alleged to be found in the Mexican-Philippine-Nicaragua vaccines. \n\nHLI cites numerous studies, many written by WHO researchers, [that document](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7418885) WHO's attempts to create an anti-fertility vaccine utilizing tetanus toxoid as a carrier. [\u201cObservations on the antigenicity and clinical effects of a candidate antipregnancy vaccine: B-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin linked to tetanus toxoid,\u201d *Fertility and Sterility,* October 1980, pp. 328-335.]\n\nNaturally, when reports began surfacing in the Philippines of tetanus toxoid vaccine being laced with hCG hormones, the WHO and the Philippine Department of Health (DOH) immediately denied the allegations.\n\n>Confronted with the results of laboratory tests which detected its presence in three of the four vials of tetanus toxoid examined, the WHO and DOH scoffed at the evidence coming from \u201cright-to-life and Catholic\u201d sources. Four new vials of the tetanus vaccine were submitted by DOH to St. Luke's (Lutheran) Medical Center in Manila\u2014and all four vials tested positive for hCG.\n\n>From outright denial the stories now shifted to the allegedly \u201cinsignificant\u201d quantity of the hCG present; the volume of hCG present is insufficient to produce anti-hCG antibodies. But new tests designed to detect the presence of hCG antibodies in the blood sera of women vaccinated with the tetanus toxoid vaccine were undertaken by Philippine pro-life and Catholic groups. \n\n>Of thirty women tested subsequent to receiving tetanus toxoid vaccine, twenty-six tested positive for high levels of anti-hCG.\n\nApparently, the WHO and the DOH didn't seriously respond to these results, instead trying to explain many of the findings as \u201cfalse positives.\u201d As for why one might use the tetanus vaccine for such a purpose:\n\n>The human body does not attack its own naturally occurring hormone hCG, the body has to be fooled into treating hCG as an invading enemy in order to develop a successful anti-fertility vaccine utilizing hCG antibodies. A paper delivered at the 4th International Congress of Reproductive Immunology (Kiel, West Germany, 26-29 July 1989) spelled it out: \u201cLinkage to a carrier was done to overcome the immunological tolerance to hCG.\u201d\n\n>After the vaccine controversy had reached a fever pitch, a new bombshell exploded; *none of the three different brands of tetanus vaccine being used had ever been licensed for sale and distribution or registered with the Philippine Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD),* as required by law. \n\n>The head of the BFAD lamely explained that the companies distributing these brands \u201cdid not apply for registration.\u201d The companies in question are Connaught Laboratories Ltd. and Intervex, both from Canada, and CSL Laboratories from Australia. \n\n>It seemed that the BFAD might belatedly require re-testing, but the idea was quickly rejected when the Secretary of Health declared that, since the vaccines had been certified by the WHO...there was assurance enough that the \u201cvaccines come from reputable manufacturers.\u201d\n\n>Just how \u201creputable\u201d one of the manufacturers might be is open to some question.

            "body": "##The Chickenpox/Shingles Charade\n\nVaccines have been introduced to counteract problems caused by old vaccines. The chickenpox vaccine contributed to a herpes zoster (shingles) epidemic that may last for more than 50 years.\n\n[Herpes zoster (HZ)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_zoster#History) is a reactivation of varicella zoster, the chickenpox virus, and only affects those previously infected with chickenpox. Although most people recover completely from chickenpox, the virus never leaves the body, and especially as people age, the virus can become active again and reappear as \u201cshingles.\u201d\n\nShingles appears as a painful rash or group of blisters on one side of the body, and usually lasts for two to four weeks. Although shingles usually resolves on its own without intervention, some treatments exist to reduce the duration of the symptoms, as well as to prevent a possible severe complication known as [postherpetic neuralgia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_herpetic_neuralgia).\n\nAlthough you can't \u201ccatch\u201d shingles from someone who is infected, you *can* come down with chickenpox if you've never had it before. Also, shingles is much more common in those over 50.\n\nIt was previously thought that the weaker immune systems of the elderly contributed to this higher rate of shingles, but [recent evidence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16126614) indicates that it's more likely because they have less contact with children affected with chickenpox. \n\nWhen most adults (who have already had chickenpox) come into contact with children infected with the virus, [their immunity is naturally and asymptomatically boosted](http://vaccineawakening.blogspot.com/2006/05/shingles-vaccine-targets-baby-boomers.html), protecting them from shingles. \n\n[According to this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1898279/), \u201cThe peculiar age distribution of zoster may in part reflect the frequency with which the different age groups encounter cases of varicella.\u201d Attacks of zoster are postponed when these periodic encounters occur. Also, even the CDC acknowledges that those who have been vaccinated against chickenpox are still susceptible to shingles.\n\nBefore widespread use of the chickenpox vaccine, there were estimated to be 500,000 shingles cases in the US each year. During the period of increasing varicella vaccination, beginning in 1998, HZ among adults [increased by 90%](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1177968/).\n\nAccording to a 2004 CDC report, the number of shingles cases in 2002 was 33% than in 2001 and 56% than 2000. [This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3759842/), a review of the US universal varicella vaccination program, stated the problem quite clearly: \n\n>HZ morbidity costs have exceeded the cost savings from varicella-disease reductions. Universal varicella vaccination has not proven to be cost-effective as increased HZ morbidity has disproportionately offset cost savings associated with reductions in varicella disease. Universal varicella vaccination has failed to provide long-term protection from VZV disease.\n\nNeil Miller summarizes the predicament:\n\n>Apparently, there is a societal benefit when chickenpox remains endemic. When the wild-type varicella virus is permitted to circulate naturally throughout society, adults receive beneficial periodic exposures to the virus boosting their immune systems and helping to suppress the reactivation of herpes zoster.\n\n>However, as more and more children are vaccinated with the synthetic or manufactured chickenpox virus, the natural virus becomes less pervasive and there are fewer opportunities for adults to receive these periodic boosts. This has led to much higher rates of shingles in Americans. \n\nThe FDA, CDC and vaccine manufacturers \u201ctraded\u201d chickenpox, a relatively mild childhood disease, for a much more serious ailment that affects adults. [Studies have shown](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15837242) the cost alone for this mistake may be astronomical:\n\n>We estimate universal varicella vaccination has the impact of an additional 14.6 million (42%) HZ cases among adults aged <50 years during a 50 year time span at a substantial cost burden of 4.1 billion US dollars or 80 million US dollars annually utilizing an estimated mean healthcare provider cost of 280 US dollars per HZ case.\n\nDr. Gary Goldman, an expert on the varicella virus, was hired in 1995 by the CDC to monitor the new chickenpox vaccine. According to Goldman:\n\n>Due to the universal varicella vaccination program whereby every healthy child is vaccinated at age 12 months, there are no longer the seasonal outbreaks of varicella that occurred in schools and communities. These annuals outbreaks and exposures (called exogenous exposures) played a significant role in boosting cell-mediated immunity to help suppress the reactivation of herpes zoster among children and adults who had a previous history of natural or wild-type varicella.\n\n[Goldman continues:](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chicken-pox-vaccine-associated-with-shingles-epidemic-54648017.html)\n\n>The universal varicella vaccination program in the US...will leave our population vulnerable to shingles epidemics...there appears to be no way to avoid a mass epidemic of shingles lasting as long as several generations among adults.\n\nAccording to Goldman, the CDC is more than aware about the problem, and that when he approached them with his concerns, they replied that \u201cany possible shingles epidemic associated with the chickenpox vaccine can be offset by treating adults with a shingles vaccine.\u201d\n\nBy 2006, the FDA had licensed Zostavax, a vaccine designed to reduce the risk of shingles. Incredibly, Merck, the same company that makes Varivax (the chickenpox vaccine), is also manufacturing Zostavax. Such an apparent conflict of interest is accepted without question, even though the very \u201csuccess\u201d of Varivax is contributing to the need for yet another product.\n\nAs a result of Goldman's research, it's quite clear how dangerous it is to create new vaccines to treat problems caused by old vaccines. He asserts:\n\n>The shingles vaccine serves as a vaccine to offset the initial deleterious effects associated with the similar and related varicella vaccine. It will be difficult to replicate the protection against shingles that existed naturally in the community when incidence of chickenpox was high.\n\n>Using a shingles vaccine to control shingles epidemics in adults would likely fail because adult vaccination programs have rarely proved successful. There appears to be no way to avoid a mass epidemic of shingles lasting as long as several generations among adults.\n\nAs for the vaccine's effectiveness when first released, even according to Merck, Zostavax was only 51% effective at \u201creducing the risk\u201d of developing HZ in those aged 60-69. Efficacy drops to 41% in those 70-79, and is merely 18% above 80.\n\nSeveral conflicts of interest also surround Merck and the HZ vaccine. Merck [participated in the organization of oversight activities and monitored the progress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15930418) of the primary study used to justify licensing the vaccine. \n\n>Several authors of the study received consultation fees, lecture fees, or honoraria from Merck. Others received grant support from Merck or owned stock in Merck\u2014all while concurrently overseeing important aspects of the study requiring complete objectivity. Two of the researchers were actively involved in this study while having \u201cpartial interests in relevant patents.\u201d Still others were employees of Merck.\n\nA member of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), Dr. William Schaffner, even [received financial payment from Merck to discuss Zostavax with reporters.](http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=62219) Neil Miller notes how this truly should be considered unacceptable:\n\n>This questionable practice lowers public confidence in the high ethical standards that should be required and are expected from the custodians of our healthcare system. It also encourages public cynicism towards media coverage of all vaccine-related news.\n\n>How can we trust *any* claim pertaining to vaccine safety and efficacy when custodians of our healthcare system are receiving money from the drug companies they are commissioned to oversee? A functional system of healthcare checks and balances is imperative.",

                        "body": "Another concern is when vaccines are given to one group with the hope of protecting another group. Miller explains:\n\n>Mass rubella vaccination campaigns were never intended to protect vaccine recipients; the disease is usually harmless when contracted by children. Instead, the goal has always been to protect the unborn fetuses of rubella-susceptible pregnant women.\n\n>When the hepatitis B vaccine was originally introduced, this same rationale was employed. Children rarely develop this disease. In the US, less that 1% of all cases occur in persons less than 15 years of age. The disease is even more uncommon in babies and toddlers. However, \u201cbecause a vaccination strategy limited to high-risk individuals has failed,\u201d and since children are \u201caccessible,\u201d they are compelled to receive the three-shot series beginning at birth.\n\nSome studies show that hepatitis B vaccine recipients lose protective antibodies after 5 to 10 years.\nThe vaccine that babies receive shortly after birth at the hospital will not be effective a few years later. \u201c[By 5 to 15 years after vaccination](http://www.hivandhepatitis.com/hbv-prevention/hbv-vaccines/3775-icaac-2012-hepatitis-b-vaccine-effective-long-term-but-some-lose-protection-after-15-years), some individuals have antibody levels below the protective threshold\u2014and in some cases even undetectable.\u201d\n\n>The necessity for multiple \u201cbooster\u201d shots is disturbing. Initially, when a new vaccine is introduced, a single shot may be recommended, Later, when the artificial immunity wears off, vaccine manufacturers and the CDC recommend one or more additional shots. \n\n>With natural immunity, which is acquired by being exposed to the actual disease, protection is not meager and temporary, but rather complete and lifelong. The child will rarely contract the disease again. This is not true with vaccines. Isn't it odd that the vaccine industry's answer to an ineffective vaccine is to compel more of it?\n\nAnother example of the strange logic employed by the media and many vaccine enthusiasts is the hysteria surrounding blaming those who are unvaccinated when there are outbreaks of disease.\n\n>Unvaccinated children are often sent home form school during outbreaks of measles, mumps and other contagious diseases. Ironically, these children are not sent home for their own protection. On the contrary, doctors claim that unvaccinated children will spread disease. \n\n>Of course, this does not make sense (unless we consider it a veiled confession of vaccine inefficacy). How is it possible for an unvaccinated child to imperil vaccinated children? If the shots are effective, then vaccinated children should be protected.\n\nMiller continues by stressing that even members of the U.S. government are aware that the current vaccine program has many shortcomings, as well as the uncomfortable fact that some members of the FDA and CDC have extremely suspect financial interests.\n\n>Hearings are regularly held to highlight problems with individual vaccines as well as to investigate the integrity of the vaccine program itself...*Members of the exclusive FDA and CDC committees that are responsible for licensing and recommending vaccines for all children in the US are permitted to have financial stakes in those vaccines.*\n\nFor example, in 2000, a congressional hearing before the Committee on Government Reform was held called [Conflicts of Interest in Vaccine Policy Making](http://www.scribd.com/doc/21687264/Conflicts-of-Interest-in-Vaccine-Policy-Making-2000). The tone of the hearing was set in the opening statements, when it was announced that they needed to determine if \u201cthe entire process of licensing and recommending vaccines\u201d has been polluted and the public trust has been violated.\n\nRecent revelations about questionable tactics to approve the first rotavirus vaccine prompted the hearing. It was suspected that members of the FDA and CDC knew about the dangers of the rotavirus vaccine before approving it and recommending it for every child in the country.\n\nDr. Kathryn Edwards, a physician on the FDA's committees that voted to recommend the vaccine, [received $255,000 a year from Wyeth-Lederle](http://www.vaccineinfo.net/issues/conflictofinterest/ConflictsOfInterestHearing.shtml), the making of the vaccine. This fact was also cited in the 2000 congressional hearing.\n\nDr. Paul Offit, who was on the CDC's committee that recommended the vaccine, also held a lucrative patent on another rotavirus vaccine under development. \u201cIn addition, [Offit] was paid by the drug industry to travel around the country and teach doctors that vaccines are safe.\u201d\n\nIndeed, even within the last few months, Offit has made appearances on numerous talk shows, both TV and radio, bemoaning those who dare to question vaccines. The vast majority of the time he specifically mentions only \u201cautism\u201d and how ignorant the \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d are for being afraid of \u201cautism.\u201d Instead of educating, he is continuing to restrict the conversation by completely omitting all of the concerns outlined so far, among many others.\n\nOne of the more striking things revealed by this hearing was with regards to the FDA and CDC advisory committees that voted to recommend adding the rotavirus vaccine to the childhood vaccination schedule. A whopping 60% of the FDA advisory committee and 50% of the CDC committee had financial ties either to the drug company that produced the vaccine or to Merck and SmithKline Beecham, two other companies developing potentially lucrative rotavirus vaccines.\n\nDuring the hearing, Congressman Dan Burton had this to say:\n\n>Families need to have confidence that the vaccines that their children take are safe, effective and very necessary. Doctors need to feel confident that when the FDA licenses a drug, that it's really safe and that the pharmaceutical industry has not influenced the decision-making process. \n\n>Maintaining the highest level of integrity over the entire spectrum of vaccine development and implementation is essential. No individual who stands to gain financially from the decisions regarding vaccines that may be mandated for use should be participating in the discussion or policymaking for vaccines.\n\nOne would think, in the face of waning public confidence in the entirety of the vaccine program, that the FDA and CDC would take the opportunity to agree with such a rational request and restore the confidence of Congress and the public. Sadly, the response was quite the opposite.\n\nOn August 24th, 2000, *Reuters Medical News* published an article called \u201cCongressional report slams FDA, CDC policies on disclosing financial conflicts.\u201d The article describes how Linda Suydam, the senior associate commissioner at the FDA, stated quite unequivocally that \u201cBoth the law and policies allow us to use people who have financial ties.\u201d Both the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) were also unwilling to make any of the recommended changes. \n\nThe rotavirus vaccine saga continued when a [2006 study](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa052664) was used by the FDA and CDC as a basis for licensing and recommending a new vaccine called RotaTeq. Neil Miller explains the obvious conflict of interest:\n\n>Authors of the study included Paul Offit and H. Fred Clark, co-owners of the patent on this vaccine (along with Dr. Stanley Plotkin). In addition, several other members of the study team who were supposed to be objectively evaluating the safety and efficacy of this vaccine, were paid consulting fees, lecture fees, and/or provided grant support by Merck, the vaccine manufacturer, or by GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of another rotavirus vaccine soon to be approved as well. \n\n>Some study team members even owned stock in Merck, whose equity value would increase by positive evaluations of this vaccine. Apparently, such conflicts of interest were deemed irrelevant to the impartiality required to ensure the integrity of the entire vaccine approval process and the safety of millions of babies who would soon receive this new vaccine.\n\nThe vaccine market is shifting towards adolescents and adults as well. According to a June 17th, 2007 article published by *Genetic Engineering and Biotech News,* \u201cat present, pediatric vaccines occupy a higher market share, but this trend will shift towards the adult vaccine segment.\u201d\n\nNaturally, the US is the largest market for vaccines because they are \u201cmore profitable than generic pharmaceutical drugs.\u201d",

With the HPV vaccine, they simply compared the numbers of these markers in women who received the vaccine to the numbers of these markers in women who received the placebo. However, *no actual cases of cervical cancer were prevented in any of the test subjects in any of the clinical studies of the HPV vaccine.*\n\nThe HPV vaccine was marketed deceptively as well when first introduced, being promoted as \u201c100%\u201d effective. However, the vaccine is only \u201c100%\u201d effective against two of numerous strains of HPV, not cervical cancer itself.\n\n>During prelicensure studies, 361 women who received at least one shot of Gardasil went on to develop precancerous lesions on their cervixes within three years.\n\nAccording to the report [HPV Vaccination \u2013 More Answers, More Questions](http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMe078060): \u201ccautious approach may be warranted in light of important unanswered questions about overall vaccine effectiveness, duration of protection, and adverse effects that may emerge over time.\u201d\n\nIn this 2007 report commissioned by the NEJM, two studies were considered on the vaccine's effectiveness on cervical cancer. The report asked: \u201cIn these trials, called Females United to Unilaterally Reduce Endo/Ectocervical Disease (FUTURE) I and II, what is the efficacy of vaccination among all subjects, regardless of causal HPV types?\u201d\n\nThe results were not promising, as it was determined that in FUTURE I that the vaccine had an efficacy of only 20%, and this was only against low-risk lesions: \u201cno efficacy was demonstrable for higher-grade disease, but the trial may have lacked adequate power to detect a difference.\u201d\n\nHowever, the larger FUTURE II had more conclusive, and even less favorable, results, as the vaccine was only 17% effective, and again had no impact on preventing high-risk lesions. The report mentions the obvious shortcomings of the vaccine: \n\n>Another factor explaining the modest efficacy of the vaccine is the role of oncogenic HPV types not included in the vaccine. At least 15 oncogenic HPV types have been identified, so targeting only 2 types may not have had a great effect on overall rates of preinvasive lesions.\n\nThis concept of \u201cstrain replacement\u201d is not limited to the HPV vaccine, and is an extremely important aspect of the vaccine debate that deserves more attention. Miller continues:\n\n>Gardasil is not the only vaccine that targets some strains of the disease while excluding others. The Hib and pneumococcal vaccines were also constructed in this manner, and have become problematic due to \u201cstrain replacement.\u201d \n\n>Scientists have discovered that when vaccines only attack some strains of a disease, other strains gain prominence. The disease becomes more virulent and people who are normally not susceptible to the ailment are infected.\n\n>For example, there are several different types of haemophilus influenzae, including types a, b, c, d, e, and f. The \u201cb\u201d type is just one strain\u2014the only one for which a vaccine was created\u2014the Hib shot. Although this vaccine appears to have decreased cases of haemophilus influenzae type b in children, *the overall rate of invasive haemophilus influenzae disease in adults increased.* \n\nResearchers don't consider this a failing of the Hib vaccine, rather [\u201cit raises the question whether a [new] vaccine will need to be developed.\u201d](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17304452)\n\nPrevnar, the pneumococcal vaccine, is only designed to protect against a few of the 90 different strains that can cause the disease. The vaccine is therefore still considered \u201ceffective\u201d if the child is stricken with pneumococcus...just not from one of the strains included in the vaccine.\n\nThe *Journal of the American Medical Association* and the *Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal* have both published data demonstrating that non-vaccine strains of pneumococcus are replacing the strains targeting by the vaccine. What's even more concerning is the new strains are more dangerous and drug-resistant. According to the study [Pediatric Invasive Pneumococcal Disease in the United States in the Era of Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3416489/):\n\n>Through the widespread use of PCV7 in the United States, there has been a significant decrease in the incidence of IPD and nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine serotypes in all age groups. *However, the emergence of replacement pneumococcal serotypes (e.g., 19A, 1, 5, 15, and 33) is now having a significant impact on the success of PCV7.* \n\n>These serotypes have become the most common causes of IPD in infants, children, and adults, with serotype 19A having emerged as the predominant replacement serotype associated with multidrug-resistant infections.",

According to a study published by *Pediatrics,* when parents were specifically asked to observe changes in their baby's behavior after a shot, only 7% reported no reactions at all.\n\nBecause of the public's general ignorance of the various types of possible damage that can result from vaccines, the true number of vaccine injuries may be vastly underreported. \n\nAccording to [this study:](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3547435/)\n\n>In 1986, Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (PL-99-660) requiring health care providers to report suspected vaccine reactions to a centralized reporting system. As a result, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), cosponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was established in 1990.\n\n>VAERS is a postmarketing safety surveillance program that collects information about possible adverse reactions (side effects) that occur after the administration of vaccines licensed for use in the United States. Current and historic VAERS data are public access, available to health care providers, vaccine manufacturers, and the general public.\n\n>VAERS receives approximately 30,000 reports annually. Since 1990, VAERS has received over 350,000 reports, most of which describe mild side effects, such as fever and local reactions. \n\n>About 13% of all reactions are classified as serious, involving life-threatening conditions, hospitalization, permanent disability, or death. By monitoring such events, VAERS helps to identify unusual patterns of reports and important safety concerns.\n\n>Our findings show a positive correlation between the number of vaccine doses administered and the percentage of hospitalizations and deaths. \n\n>Since vaccines are given to millions of infants annually, it is imperative that health authorities have scientific data from synergistic toxicity studies on all combinations of vaccines that infants might receive. Finding ways to increase vaccine safety should be the highest priority.\n\nHowever, the FDA estimates that 90% of doctors don't even report reactions. Continuing from the study on VAERS:\n\n>Since VAERS is a passive system, it is inherently subject to underreporting. For example, a confidential study conducted by Connaught Laboratories, a vaccine manufacturer, indicated that \u201ca fifty-fold underreporting of adverse events\u201d is likely. \n\n>[According to David Kessler](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=406452), former commissioner of the FDA, *\u201conly about one percent of serious events [adverse drug reactions] are reported.\u201d*\n\n>[According to Ottaviani et al.,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231176/) \u201cAny case of sudden unexpected death occurring...in infancy, especially soon after a vaccination, should always undergo a full necropsy study,\u201d otherwise a true association between vaccination and death may escape detection.\n\n >[A recent study by Kuhnert et al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21337361/) demonstrated a 16-fold increase in unexplained sudden unexpected death after the fourth dose of a penta- (5-in-1) or hexavalent (6-in-1) vaccine. \n\n>Similarly, [Zinka et al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15908063/) reported 6 cases of sudden infant death syndrome that occurred within 48 hours following the administration of a hexavalent vaccine. At postmortal examination, these cases showed \u201cunusual findings in the brain\u201d that appeared compatible with an association between hexavalent vaccination and sudden infant death syndrome.\n\n>*These examples provide additional evidence that cases of vaccine-related mortality are likely underreported in VAERS.* \n\nAccording to Neil Miller, one of the authors of the aforementioned study, the federal government is aware of the unnecessarily high danger of many vaccines.\n\n>In fact, Congress established a \u201chazard\u201d tax on childhood vaccines. When parents pay the doctor for requested shots, some of that money goes into a special fund to compensate them when their children are seriously damaged or die.\n\n>As of September 2009, nearly $2 billion was granted for thousands of injuries and deaths caused by mandated vaccines. Numerous cases are still pending. Awards were issued for permanent injuries such as learning disabilities, seizure disorders, mental retardations, paralysis, and numerous deaths, including many that were initially misclassified as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\n>Parents need to understand that vaccines are drugs. Each one contains a proprietary blend of chemicals, pathogens and other foreign matter. That is the nature of a vaccine.\n\n>Today, children receive one vaccine at birth, eight vaccines at two months, eight vaccines at four months, nine vaccines a six months, and twelve additional vaccines between 12 and 18 months (DtaP and MMR are each given with a single injection but contain three vaccines).\n\n>The United States is the most vaccinated country in the world, yet it has a poor infant mortality rate. One would think that a country with *more* immunizations, which are explicitly promoted as life saving, especially for babies, would have an excellent infant death rate...as new vaccines are added to the recommended vaccine schedule, the US infant mortality rate worsens.\n\n>In 1960 (before mass vaccines) the US had one of the best infant mortality rates in the world. By 1998, the US dropped to 28th place. By 2006 [the US] fell to 42nd place, worse than Cuba but ahead of Croatia.\n\nInteresting that Croatia would be so low on that list as well, as their policy towards vaccinating infants was made very clear by recent legislation *forcing* all parents to vaccinate, a disturbing decision that was even more disturbingly lauded by those who think the vaccine debate is only about \u201cautism.\u201d\n\nHowever, Miller is quite clear that vaccination *does* prevent disease...the tragedy is that greed and conspiracy have created a system that is becoming increasingly difficult to trust.\n\n>If you choose not to vaccinate, there are risks involved. Your child could contract a disease for which a vaccine has been developed. Your child may also experience complications form this disease, which could be permanently debilitating or life-threatening, depending on the particular condition and other factors, such as the child's physical constitution and its ability to reestablish health.\n\n>Not vaccinating is just one risk; vaccinating is another...diseases are described in frightening detail and their risks exaggerated beyond reality.\n\n>With vaccines (and many drugs as well) the \u201csolution\u201d is often developed prior to the marketing of fear. For example, *before* the chickenpox vaccine was licensed for general use in 1995, doctors would encourage parents to expose their children to the disease while they were young. Doctors recommended this course of action because they knew that chickenpox is relatively innocuous when contracted prior to the teenage years, but more dangerous in adolescents and adults.\n\nIt wasn't until *after* the vaccine was licensed that the CDC began warning parents about the dangers of chickenpox. Many doctors soon stopped encouraging parents to expose their children and instead receive the shot. The \u201csolution\u201d\u2014a vaccine\u2014preceded the apparent danger.",

So at hand we have clear examples of its dangers: [Pandremix anti-flu vaccine \"causing\" Narcolepsy](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/h1n1_narcolepsy_pandemrix.html) (caused not by the latent virus, but from its production) an obvious and serious example of such dangers, yet the continuation of such programs is troubling as it also encourages discrediting vaccination itself.\n\nThe dangers of over-vaccination (HPV, flu, SARS) are just as dangerous as the current \"psychoactive\" drugs \"trend\" applied  to children.

Licensed health practitioners are available for this purpose.\n\nAlthough the following tends to find fault with many vaccines and the vaccine industry, if you're going to read this, *please* review the copious amount data compiled by official sources of vaccine information, including the FDA, CDC, WHO, as well as the pharmaceutical companies themselves.\n\nOnly then will it become possible to have a serious, informed discussion about this unbelievably complex topic. \n\nToo often are such conversations suppressed or dismissed because \u201cthe science is in\u201d on the subject of vaccines.\n\nThis is an attempt to offer the *decreasingly* blasphemous view that the science is not, in fact, \u201cin.\u201d\n\nThis statement, and the following material, isn't meant to argue that the *theory* behind vaccination is flawed. *Vaccines do work. This has been demonstrated again and again.*\n\n*However*...in humanity's desperation to overcome the terror of crippling pandemics, inexcusable and irreparable mistakes were made in the frantic rush to rid mankind of the devastating effects these diseases. \n\nThis isn't about autism. This isn't about global \u201cpopulation reduction\u201d reduction programs. \n\nThis is about very real, and very frightening, mistakes that have made in the history of the development of vaccines. \n\nThis is about the obfuscation of the early history of vaccination...obfuscation which continues to this day, and which has the detrimental effect of stifling a serious debate on this vitally important subject.\n\nNot only has the discussion on vaccine safety become completely polarized, but it also has devolved into a false dichotomy: you're either \u201cpro\u201d-vaccine or \u201canti\u201d-vaccine. This has had the extremely unfortunate effect of severely limiting the conversation. Sadly, many important topics today have fallen victim to this false dichotomy.\n\nBefore continuing, I'd like to acknowledge a few books that opened my eyes to this controversial but fascinating field of research.\n\nThe first is [The Virus and the Vaccine](http://www.amazon.com/The-Virus-Vaccine-Contaminated-Government/dp/0312342721), a fascinating true story of the contamination of the polio vaccine with a cancer-causing monkey virus (full text available [here](http://www.vaksinite.info/The%20Virus%20and%20the%20Vaccine.html)).\n\nThe second is [Dr. Mary's Monkey](http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Marys-Monkey-Cancer-Causing-Assassination/dp/0977795306). Although I didn't use this book as a source, it's a thrilling story in its own right, and weaves together the JFK assassination, the contaminated polio vaccine scandal, and a secret project to develop a bio-weapon to kill Fidel Castro. \n\nLastly I owe much of this research to the indispensable [Vaccine Safety Manual for Concerned Families and Health Practitioners.\n](http://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Concerned-Families-Practitioners-Edition/dp/188121737X) The thousands of references provided have proved to be a veritable gold mine.\n\nThis is a work in progress.

They claimed it was \"much better\" but in reality is was \"much worse\" when he left office. But, that being said, do you not realize that what fucked the economy for him is continuing to fuck the economy now? Also, there was no \"record job growth\" under Trump. The record job growth happened *under Biden* not Trump.\n2. And yet, we were still at war when he left office. My statement is 100% true, Biden is the only POTUS in the last 20 years to have no US troops in combat, and like Trump has hasn't started any new wars.\n3. OP didn't say \"lower\" they said \"no high prices.\" Maybe it is a pedantic point, but I've always heard people whining about the price of things. But, yes, absolutely, prices are higher now due to higher inflation. And, again, that is due to fed policy under Trump and Biden, not because of either of the presidents.\n4. Trump literally said he was going to pull us out of NATO. [Even far right newsmax had to admit that Trump weakened NATO.](https://www.newsmax.com/CharlesKrauthammer/nato-trump-america-power/2017/06/01/id/793680/) You'd have to be really slurping the trump kool-aid to not see his open attacks on it.\n5. OP said \"threats from NK.\" They threatened us less than a year after the last meeting, while Trump was still in office. So this is absolutely true, but you moved the goal posts. But, still, you are wrong. North Korea had 9 missile tests between the time Trump met him (June 2019) and when Biden took office.\n6. According to the people of the world. Opinion of the US dropped dramatically when he entered office.\n7. Don't look at me, it was the OP claiming that being nominated was actually better than getting one.\n8. How does it feel when every talking point aligns with Russia propaganda or comes straight from the mouth of the most dishonest POTUS of all time?\n\n>You\u2019re right TDS is real. You don\u2019t have to be a cultist to see that Trump did a lot of good shit.\n\nAnd you have to be suffering from TDS to miss the fact that he brought a whole lot more bad shit than good, and that he was a corrupt liar that put our who republic at risk because his fragile ego couldn't handle the fact that he lost the election.",

As the saying goes, one can't have their cake and eat it too. Either the POTUS is in control, or they aren't. Additionally, if we claim the pandemic is what screwed his economy, you have to also recognize that the effects of the pandemic are still reverberating through the economy today. So you can't fault the current POTUS for the economy, without outright contradicting yourself again.\n\nThe reality is that the POTUS has little control over the economy. Trump was handed a healthy and steadily expanding economy, which continued to be healthy and expanding. . . until a pandemic came around. Since then, the effects of the pandemic have been reverberating throughout the economy and we haven't recovered. None of this has pretty much anything to do with who is or was the POTUS.",

No job, just bitching about the world around you. All I try to do is open people's eyes. All you do is talk trash because you have zero understanding of the world around you. We will never be the same. I only hope you open your eyes and stop blindly following the narrative like you are. And again, unlike you, I've done the research over the years and know.  You wouldn't be such a tool right now if you had done the same. Instead you try to call me out because trying to educate people with a mind like yours is nearly impossible. It's wasted energy, much like I'm doing now.  Like I said, all you can do is trash talk. You ever want to have an actual debate with proven, sourced facts, let me know and we will have it out.

Trying to extend an illegal order to halt evictions, and putting the entire weight of bills and taxes solely on the owners (who may just be Mom & Pop run) and giving the squatters a free pass.  Continuing to give \"stimulus\" checks to the detriment of our deficit run economy.  Continuously going after our Constitional 2A Rights.  The failed appropriate exit of Afghanistan, leaving _billions_ of dollars of equipment to be seized and most likely sold to our military/political enemies.  Also handing over access to some of the largest sources for materials to be used in solar capture technology, while at the same time outsourcing our productions for that tech to our enemies (like China) AND pushing for expedited laws to remove us from fossil fuel reliance, giving countries like China the upper hand financially (this is as close to one can get to legally funnel money from the US to communist China).\n\nThere are other things as well, which any US citizen who has been paying attention over the last 2.5 years should be able to recognize unless  they are willfully ignorant and naive.",

Trump literally handed his economic advisors a piece of paper with numbers written on it and told them to give him those numbers, so one can only imagine the level of skullduggery involved when the economy is planned backwards.\n\n>No Covid or things like this\n\nIt literally surfaced on Trump's watch.\n\n>He was against lockdowns.\n\nHe viewed making money as more important than saving lives.\n\n>No wars\n\nAmerica is never not at war. The economy depends on war.\n\n>Russia didn't attack Ukraine\n\nWhat the literal fuck. By that logic, Biden is a great president because Germany didn't invade Poland.\n\n>No threats from NK\n\nNot true. He and NK both made threats to each other.\n\n>Putin respected him.\n\nNot true. Putin thought he was a clown, which is why he wanted him in charge in the first place. The idea that Russia wants a strong, competent leader in charge of the United States is self-contradictory and stupid.\n\n>Leaders around the world respected him\n\nOK, I'm going to stop reading there because you've flown past untrue and into utterly absurd fantasy.

Absolutely pathetic. \n\nEveryone I know that voted for Biden A. Lives in a bubble so they don\u2019t pay attention to economy, foreign affairs, alleged corruption, speech disabilities, etc.  or\nB. Is deflecting to a severe degree. I have friends who still send January 6 updates in our political group chat while we\u2019re sending trillions to Ukraine as well as selling oil reserves. The mindset of a Biden voter is a very bleak place void of any rational thoughts or questions. \n\nThe thing about Biden voters is most of them don\u2019t care about politics and the economy. According to the recent data, Republicans have gained voters in every demographic despite college educated whites women. Thats pathetically sad. Think about that demographic for a second\u2026 the majority of Biden voters are wealthy white girls still in college or between like 20-45. How many leftist infographics does this demographic post on their social media everytime a controversial even happens, only to never be seen again. They are fad chasers. Biden voters for the most part, have no real understanding of the world around us, thus they can say or do whatever they want because they no their main demographic isn\u2019t nearly as engaged in politics. That\u2019s why since  Obama they\u2019ve hammered social issues in the media way harder than actual foreign affairs and finance. That\u2019s why dems could still easily win in 2024 despite biden disaster. They don\u2019t even know about 50% of the disaster because they spend most of their days on Instagram, Twitter, or worrying about things that don\u2019t really affect our country. Biden lost ground in every demographic besides \u201ceducated\u201d white women\u2026 let that sink in. As a black male it\u2019s pretty disheartening seeing the misinformation and manipulation around racism. The white girls fall for that shit like candy in a basket. The good news is way more Blacks in America are seeing through Biden and honestly I expect an even greater number of Hispanics and blacks to vote red in 2024. Hispanics and African Americans want change but are starting to understand the media, democratic politicians, and fake white girls on Instagram truly do not care. But to summarize, Biden voters don\u2019t really know much about politics or the world for the most part thus will continue to vote blue. The main demographic of democrats are wealthy white women\u2026Aka a huge red flag. There\u2019s an article titled \u201cthe realignment\u201d which highlights the change within the respective parties. Dems are described as becoming the \u201cparty of the elite\u201d v the common man.",

Believe it or not.\n\nI took Jessica Biel to Paris remotely for her birthday gave her eberything she likes she came back was on the Tonight Show with David Letterman, And everyone cannot believe how good she looks so tell us all.\n\nSo she has to make up stories and tells them all sorts of stuff that didn't happen.\n\nThe next day Jessica Alba is in Paris on the balcony calling me.\n\nI took that pretty little liar [Shay Mitchell](https://thefashion-court.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shay-mitchell-in-azzedine-alaia-cnn-heroes-event-2013.png) and Michelle Rodriguez to Paris for a threesome she came back looking so incredible you could not book a hotel room in Paris for a year after that we broke Paris so badly that time.\n\nHere is Jessica Biel on Letterman\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLwPlQWSWM0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLwPlQWSWM0)\n\nSee if you can understand his hand signals see if you can understand hers at all.",

No NEW wars.

It\u2019s impossible to say Russia didn\u2019t invade Ukraine because trump was there. If anything Putin waited until we had a far more militarily aggressive administration in office.

Putin played the trump game to create disorder, he would have shot trump in the face and slept like a baby. \n9. Which leaders? \n10. Noble Prizes are a fucking joke. Obama won one. \n11.

Even the people I knew who supported him didn\u2019t love him, they just hated the other side more. \n12. I think he cared as much as a politician can, maybe. But end of the day he loved himself. Look how he treated his supporters who were at 1/6. Any supporter who wasn\u2019t helpful to him was discarded. He didn\u2019t give a fuck end of the day. \n14/15. Investigation predated him.

Most of his colleagues were snakes in the grass. He derailed the agenda and set them back years by not being bought and paid. A true American hero. Shame the majority of this truth-seeking sub are too disillusioned and brainwashed themselves to realize the man was a true patriot with good intention.

I don't want to insinuate anything bad with or about the Russians.\n\nThe main factor was Trump became increasingly skeptical and cautious towards his own intelligence services and he did not take much attention to even read the daily security briefing. Likewise the woke faction of the CIA and other branches dislikes him to the core. In their view he divided the United States.\n\nI'm more concerned about the rogue, woke CIA and deep state than Trump himself. At least we could see what he is standing for and he's a patriot.",

You spent longer trying to investigate him, and coming back with nothing. \n\n>But hey let\u2019s not mention anything about Biden\u2019s sus behavior and actions.\n\nI have not once stopped you or denied he's done those things. They're just not related to how Trump tried to use military aid for Ukraine as leverage for the same behavior that got Nixon removed from office. That isn't related to the fact that Trump is directly responsible for weakening Ukraine mere months before Putin invaded.\n\n>why don\u2019t we at least look into it?\n\nGood question. It's because there's a backlog of Whitehouse crimes to get through the courts from Trump's presidency. /s\n\nWe should. Your fervent insistence that I must be okay with Biden, just because I think Trump is worse is creating dozens of straw men. I would like to remind you that two things can be bad at once, and the one attempting to overthrow democracy with lies and angry mobs takes priority.\n\n>let\u2019s go after the guy who has been in politics for 4 years vs the one who has been in politics for 50 years\n\nYes. Because that's the stupidest way to determine the worst of two individuals. The confederacy also lasted 4 years, to the US's well over 200. Clearly the slavers we're the good guys there eh?",

At the very least he was trying to suck up to Putin to get a hotel. Remember Cohen's testimony? I bet you don't. Let me guess he is too corrupt to be trusted. Yeah but the orange clown had no problems with him until he became a liability.\n\nI watched the over 40 minute testimonial (not pixelated) of the woman accusing him of rape. The woman was honest, candid demeanor (no drama), and forthright and provided enough detail to convince me she was telling the truth. In the end she was either given hushmoney or threatened into hiding.\n\nI don't care what lawyer was pushing her into the limelight and don't care if the liberals were footing the bill because that's what scumbag politicians do they like to expose each other to gain the upper hand.\n\nIf you really think that a selfish egotistical clown like trump could be some kind of hero in this world, so be it. Deluded people like you are part of the reason why we are in this mess.

It's very difficult for ANYONE, especially for a guy that had the whole deepstate against him, with virtually unlimited money and power and connections, to do such thing, because he was attacked every day until his last day of presidency, and as you see and understand, is continuing. But if he returns in power, I'm sure something will happen.\n\nSixth point:\n\nRight. But he exposed it. Noone exposed the swamp as he did. That's why they are still attacking him relentlessly even after 4 years of attacks and impeachements and everything.\n\nSeventh point:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERdiAlxGc0c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERdiAlxGc0c)\n\nEighth point:\n\n[https://nypost.com/2022/02/22/trump-talks-threatening-putin-mocking-merkel-at-mar-a-lago/](https://nypost.com/2022/02/22/trump-talks-threatening-putin-mocking-merkel-at-mar-a-lago/)\n\nBonus: He also threatened Erdogan: [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-threatens-totally-destroy-obliterate-turkey-s-economy-n1063366](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-threatens-totally-destroy-obliterate-turkey-s-economy-n1063366)\n\nOne must have balls to threaten the 3 most powerful leaders in the world!\n\nNinth point:\n\nLook point 8.\n\nTenth point:\n\nOf course. There is no one powerful that is not threatened or has had lawsuits. Except the deepstate of course.\n\nEleventh point:\n\nOK. But of course to other politicians this never happened :) only to Trump and we know why.\n\nTwelfth point:\n\nTrue that he made operation warp speed. But he didn't invent the vaccine.\n\nPeople needed a solution, or he would lose credibility and voters. If that would happen, people would not vote en masse because of the rona. Biden would have still won but by stealing less. Remember, the fact that he got 81 million votes, the most of an incumbent president was for the fact that he repeatedly downplayed the rona (as it should) and gave strength to his supporters to go out there and vote. He was and is against the mandates, lockdowns, and everything that has to do with the rona.\n\nAgain, if it wasn't for Trump, who btw is NOT a politician, people would not have seen the swamp, would have ALL the vaccines of the rona, would still be with masks, and on and on and on!",

Why were covid deaths only marketable with trump, but not Biden? \n\nI could offer dozens of examples, but admittedly, most of them are likely influenced by my own bias. So, I will use an example that you should be able to objectively compare. \n\nTrump was painted as being mentally unstable - to the point where he had to prove otherwise by taking a highly publicized dementia test. They said he would start a world war, they said his decisions would lead to the deaths of innocents. \n\nNo wars were started under trump.\n\nBiden cannot read a teleprompter correctly and needs strict directions to prevent him from going off script. I\u2019ve heard Biden speak publicly many times in the past, he was articulate and had a commanding presence. Now, that is no longer the case. \n\nWhere is the 24/7 media circus demanding Biden take a cognitive ability test? Especially considering that we are on the verge of starting a world war against the largest nuclear arsenal in the history of mankind. If you have a reasonable explanation for all this, I\u2019m all ears. \n\nTo me, it seems like a clear effort to manipulate people to adhering to a progressive agenda. It\u2019s extremely dishonest - why would they need to obfuscate, lie and bend the truth to market their own ideas? Why don\u2019t the ideas stand on their own merit?",

And have they fully lifted the \"need to be jabbed before crossing boarders\" policy yet if the virus is no big deal anymore like they're lifting or trying to lift or lifted title 42.? Way more support is being sent to Ukraine than this country's economy besides. For now, they're illegal immigrants, but once the democrats and Biden Administration nicely make the citizens despite their status as being illegal, then you and many others probably won't even see them as illegals anymore like they've always been citizens.",

Around the world because in the USA politics depended lot of other world politics\n2. No Covid or things like this (EDIT: excluding the last year and we know why. Because at the 2020 Davos meeting he gave them the middle finger and 1 month after covid appeared)\n3. Edit: He was against lockdowns.\n4. No wars.\n5. No high prices in the goods and services.\n6. Russia didn't attack Ukraine (that the MSM narrative is spinning every problem atributting it to Russia).\n7. No threats from NK. He actually met with Kim Jong, and they respected him.\n8. Putin respected him.\n9. Leaders around the world respected him (excluding the deep interstate).\n10. Nominated 3 or 4 times for Nobel Prize (but ultimately Joe Biden and Kamala got it lol EDIT. I WAS WRONG. THEY WERE NOMINATED FOR IT, BUT DIDN'T WIN IT!).\n11. People in the USA loved him. They understood very well that MSM and deep-state did EVERYTHING in their power to weaken him, prosecute him, impeach him and everything.\n12. He actually cared about USA and it's citizens.\n13. Did everything in his power to build the wall so the illegal immigrants could not enter (and subsequently invade USA and ultimately to vote illegaly for the DP).\n14. During his Presidency, Epstein was arrested.\n15. During his presidency, Maxwell was arrested.\n16. Lots of operations succeeded putting in jail, drug traffickers, children traffickers etc.\n17.  Extension of the post 9/11 GI Bill. [He removed the 15 year limit,](https://militarybenefits.info/forever-gi-bill/) and now veterans and their families can use the GI Bill \u201cforever\u201d instead of needing to use it within 15 years.\n18. Trump signed the First Step Act, which was at least a small step toward prison and sentencing reform. Of course, Congress deserves most of the credit, but at least Trump was in support of it. \n19. When John Bolton was in the Bush administration he was a proponent of invading Iraq. As National Security Adviser to Donald Trump, he advised pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal. In 2019, when Iran shot down a US drone, John Bolton wanted retaliatory strikes on Iran, which Trump stopped and was quoted as saying, the strikes were \"not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone.\" \n20. No wars.\n\nAs an European citizen, watching how things are unfolding since the Davos meeting in 2020 (where everyone was against Trump) until this point in time, I would like him again as a president.\n\nAnd yes, I think the election was stolen and please spare me...but but people voted him because he was arrogant. Look what you have now in Presidency. Since this dude came in presidency it's only wars, failures, high prices, masks, mandates, vaccines, crime and the current US politics are impacting the whole world in every single step and direction.\n\nIt was a big fat conspiracy to remove him of presidency because he hindered for 4 years straight every single plan they had, and that's why people are awake now, because they're behind with the plan and trying to catch up and they can no longer move in shadows and do things quietly, they have to rush, and now everything is clear as cristal!\nEdit: and before coming at me for some things that I wrote maybe you'll find some answers here.\nhttps://youtu.be/sb9jRqgDOJ8\nANOTHER EDIT FOUND IN A POST 2 YEARS AGO:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/i30m7u/comment/g086ryh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nThanks!"

On top of him running up the debt, having business shutdown and have to cancel events, high crime, food lines and burning cities I would most definitely say he\u2019s the worst in history.  I\u2019m for democracy and capitalism.  Trump is against what the USA stands for.  Happy we have Biden.  Things are getting better but it\u2019s going to take years to fix what Trump has broken.\n\nNo idea why the Hunter Biden thing is a thing.  Still have seen nothing other than accusing him.  Also don\u2019t care it\u2019s Biden\u2019s son.  Even Trumps own Justice Bill Bar said it\u2019s nothing.\n\nI agree about the vaccine, but his own supporters brought it down and still do today.  So he now has support after it was proven to be effective from the left but it is still hated by the right.\n\nEveryone thinks Jan 6th was an insurrection.  It\u2019s still called that.  Even Ted Cruz has called it an act of terror multiple times.\n\nHe was a crap president is all.",

Trump spent every penny he could to try and look better, he even sent a signed letter with the stimulus checks.  he raided the treasury, and was out of office by the time the shit hit the fan.  the Idea that Biden could have caused that much inflation in less than a year is ridiculous.  They are both responsible, Trump more so because he was spending longer and cutting government revenue while doing so.

      "body": "Love him, or hate him, President Trump was able to expose the media as the frauds they are. No matter what position Trump took on a issue the media took the opposite. \n\nThe biggest example of this is the VACCINE. Trump got the Vaccine out in record time. But what was the medias position of the Vaccine when Trump was in charge? Well they gave a History lesson on why rushed Vaccines are BAD. \n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/09/01/health/eua-coronavirus-vaccine-history/index.html\n\nOne of my favorite articles highlighting the pure hypocrisy because it was funded by Trump ^. But hey I\u2019m the Conspiracy Theorist lmao \ud83e\udd23. \n\nAnd another example War. Remember when the Media was accusing Trump of starting a War with Iran after Iran shot down there own plane? I do. \n\nAny War started by Trump and the media was going insane. Any War Trump tried to leave and the media went insane. But now the media totally supports World War 3 with Russia. Why? Because it\u2019s Biden and not Trump. It\u2019s (D)ifferent. In the last week I\u2019ve heard more talk of Nuclear War then in the last 30 years. As if it\u2019s totally normal. \n\nYet here we are. 1+ year later with Biden and the media has done a 360 flip. The media actually did there job when Trump was in charge. They QUESTIONED what the government was doing. But with Biden they don\u2019t question the governments actions like they did with Trump. The media repeats the government\u2019s talking points. And if you don\u2019t repeat our talking points it\u2019s \u201cMisinformation\u201d or your a agent of PUTIN! Claim Fact Checkers. \n\nTrump: Build A Wall. !\n\nThe Media: That\u2019s Racist! \n\nWashington: Jan 6th was a Insurrection! Were going to build a Wall around buildings the Public owns twice. \n\nThe Media: Okay. We fine with that. Totally normal and not at all a indicator of a Dictatorship or anything. \n\nI could go on and on. The Trump Presidency exposed the Hypocrisy of the media. Rushed Vaccines are bad under Trump. But under Biden you better take this rushed Vaccine or you no longer have a job. Trump is old. But unlike many of the old Politicians Trump stopped being one after his 1st Political job. He holds no office. Funny how when a complete outsider takes power the Deep State goes absolutely insane. President Bush committed real war crimes. Democrats threaten to impeach Bush many times. But they didn\u2019t. Bush is a elite insiders. Trump is a outsider. That\u2019s why Trump went down as the only President to be impeached twice. Once over Ukraine. And again over fake insurrection that never happened. \n\nHunter Biden Laptop is Russian Misinformation! Yet 1 year later the Hunter Biden Laptop is real. Why isn\u2019t the media calling for the impeachment of Joe Biden? Hunter Biden has a ton of Child Porn on his Laptop. Yet after being confirmed to be the real the media still ignores the CP. The media searched high and low for the Golden Shower Tape and it turns it to be fake. Yet the CP on Hunter Biden? Silence. \n\nThe game is rigged. The outsider beat the insider. Hillary was chosen to be President. Trump\u2019s election was the only real election win in a long time."

In some developed countries, by the time children are 4 to 6 years old, they will have received a total of 126 antigenic compounds along with high amounts of aluminum (Al) adjuvants through routine vaccinations. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, safety assessments for vaccines have often not included appropriate toxicity studies because vaccines have not been viewed as inherently toxic.\"\n\nhttp://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0961203311430221",

This works well for some viruses, like polio, because the virus doesn't change shape often enough to work around a vaccinated population.

We are indoctrinated with the mantra that \u2018vaccines are safe and effective\u2019\u2014neither of which is true. Doctors today are given extensive training on how to talk to \u2018hesitant\u2019 parents\u2014how to frighten them by vastly inflating the risks during natural infection. \u2026on the necessity of twisting parents\u2019 arms to conform, or fire them from their practices. Doctors are trained that NOTHING bad should be said about any vaccine, period.\u201d [1]\n\nDr. Bob Sears:\n\n\u201cDoctors learn a lot about diseases in medical school, but we learn very little about vaccines. \u2026 We don\u2019t review the research ourselves. We never learn what goes into making vaccines or how their safety is studied. So, when patients want a little more information about shots, all we can really say as doctors is that the diseases are bad and the shots are good.\u201d [2]\n\nDr. Larry Palevsky:\n\n\u201cI was taught that vaccines were completely safe and completely effective. But I kept seeing that my experience \u2026 in using and reading about vaccines, and hearing what parents were saying about vaccines were very different from what I was taught \u2026 When I look at the studies that the AAP and the CDC put out, saying that there\u2019s no correlation between vaccination and autism or vaccinations and asthma, I have to say that the studies just don\u2019t hold up to the scientific standards.\u201d [3]",

This determination along with the functions of both SNPs is listed in their discussion but makes no determination of the extremity of symptoms due to the vaccination. In summary, this study is a long way from supporting your basis that vaccines cause autism (because it only suggests that certain symptoms correlate with the existence of certain variations of certain genes), and directly opposes your stance on academia's ability to determine liability.\n\n>keep bragging about that education. all it means is that you licked boots longer than the next kid\n\nIf that's what you think it all means, no wonder you can't even read your own studies let alone find any that support your position with any degree of finality.\n\n>your \"education\" left you believing that men have walked on the moon\n\n\nI'm going to provide you a suite of resources to determine the validity of this:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_evidence_for_Apollo_Moon_landings\n\ntake a look at those sources, hell get your own telescope and follow any future missions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_missions_to_the_Moon#Future_missions\n\nthere's even video evidence: https://youtu.be/RMINSD7MmT4\n\nYou're just being a complete nutter by trying to disagree with such an established fact.\n\n>your \"education\" left you believing that Columbus' crew were flat-earthers\n\n>https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/busting-a-myth-about-columbus-and-a-flat-earth/2011/10/10/gIQAXszQaL_blog.html\n\nSo some lesson from fourth grade was wrong so all of academia is useless?

Social studies and poli sci classes do cover the voting process and many states do try to make voting as easy as possible (though interference with this is also a common enough). Gym and health classes are a national requirement from elementary school. Once again social studies and other current event classes are commonly available in high school at the latest (also covers legal statutes). Secondary languages are mandatory in most states.\n\n(Now how things that were taught aren't useful) Dissection is a part of biological courses due to its reinforcement of multiple systems with specific purposes interacting to forma more complex mechanism. Shakespeare classics are taught due to its importance in western culture and empathetic characters (e.g. they explicit motivations with the use of monologues and the use of the comedy/tragedy/history theme). Isotopic and biological basis are important in combating the ignorant theories like demons in the body. Historical literacy helps the understanding of cause and effect, he specifically mentions Henry VIII and his marriages as political importance. Optics is not commonly expanded due to its niche importance, but once again as a part of a larger scientific curriculum to understanding how the world work and the ability to determine phenomena from those basic rules. He mentions cursive just before an affidavit despite cursive's commonality at the time being an official usage. Mathematics is similar to the scientific curriculum with only one of its parts being the ability to understand how one can extrapolate answers from incomplete data. I assume he's talking about the hippocratic theory and is again part of teaching the populace about the larger understandable basis of cause and effect with observable factors. Which ironically he directly mentions its importance in the next line about effective vs ineffective medicine which the theory and its iterative usage learns from. Basic arithmetic is a useful skill, the prevalence of smartphones is irrelevant due to the people that don't have access to those devices are likely to need the skill anyways.\n\nYou want to learn these things? Here we go:\n\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/courses/\n\nWhich has multiple classes devoted to understanding both political factors, legal aspects, language, philosophical, logic, and medical (including psychological or sociological) aspects.\n\n**You literally linked to something that academia was structured about. That is a more extensive focused education on certain issues directly important to one's own life. You can go to your local community college and enroll in classes of just about anything you want to know let alone both paid or free online courses through other universities or places like khan academy.**",

Definitely not a saturated field.  I've already worked several paid positions at prestigious research institutions (WHOI and MBL to name a couple) so that will definitely give me a leg up in the job market once I finish grad school.  Dunno what you learned about electricity that makes you think I don't know what it is/how it works.  I can tell you definitively, though I'm not an electrical engineer, I have taken courses on Electricity and Magnetism and performed experiments to test the foundations of our understanding of the phenomena.  They all performed as expected. As for what I've learned/am learning in school, it definitely informs everything I do in my current position in my research lab.  I certainly learn more specific or complicated applications of general principals when working in the lab but without the foundation knowledge from classes on the subject I would be absolutely lost.  For instance, when I have to clone and purify a specific protein with a specific tag that I want to use in an assay, I might be able to simply follow the protocol like a recipe, but I would have no idea about the underlying mechanisms by which the protocol worked.  I would have no idea what to try and fix if something went wrong.  I would have no idea how to interpret certain errors or how to modify the protocol under different conditions.  These are all things that other's who work in the lab will not help you with because they have time consuming work, they are struggling to get their assays to work correctly, and that is stuff that I should already know before even stepping foot in the lab.  What was your boss's field?  What degrees did he get? Also, can you tell me what the real deal with electricity is?  I'm very curious now.",

Lately, symptoms following HPV vaccination have been suspected of being caused by the addition of aluminium adjuvant (Tomljenovic 2011; Lee 2012; Poddighe 2014; Brinth 2015a; Gruber 2015; Martinez-Lavin 2015). A recent animal study by Inbar and colleagues managed to spark further controversy by demonstrating behavioral abnormalities in mice administered the aluminium-containing HPV vaccine Gardasil (Inbar 2016a). Compared to previous animal studies on HPV vaccines, the authors included two control groups: one where mice were administered aluminium adjuvant alone and another with placebo without adjuvant (Inbar 2016a). Inbar and colleagues concluded that Gardasil via both its aluminium adjuvant and HPV antigens can trigger neuro-inflammation and autoimmune reactions, leading to behavioural changes in mice (Inbar 2016a). Upon submission to a peer-reviewed journal, the paper was accepted with revisions, and published. However, it was soon withdrawn by the editor (Inbar 2016), only to be published in a competing journal shortly thereafter (Inbar 2016a). The initial withdrawal was allegedly due to \"unsound scientific results\"; an assertion which was not supported by the final publisher. \n\nThe theory that aluminium adjuvant is responsible for symptoms following HPV vaccination is impossible to refute or prove based on the current data. Aluminium adjuvant has been administered to both experimental and control group in the vast majority of randomised clinical trials on HPV vaccines, thus masking its potentially harmful effects (Exley 2011). Clinical trials designed to administer vaccine adjuvants to the experimental group as well as the placebo group do, de facto, not compare an intervention against a true placebo, and therefore, do not adequately assess safety (Exley 2011). Indeed, aluminium adjuvants, new or old, should be evaluated for benefits and harms on their own merits.",

One also needs to understand the premise of the paper and if any other science resembles the results of the paper of interest before or after the paper being analyzed.  Has it been reproducible?  Or did another study reach a null result or a counter?  Are the claims *actually* outlandish? And why? What other scientific paradigms does it conflict with?  Could it be the type of \"outlandish\" that dismantles heavily indoctrinated concepts in which a lot of momentum has been built?\n\nWhat are the **reasons** for dismissing the paper solely on the grounds of funding?  Some are stronger than others - ex: when a private lobby / corp funds research which **is not the case for either of these two.** Of course, funding is one important thread to follow.  But first, I'd suggest reading the paper to see if you could at least entertain the experimental design / results.  So did *you* do that or just jump to the funding?\n\nIn my earnest opinion the best funding does come from tax payers (public institutions - one of the above, the other is a mix of public and private funding)\n\nThere are problems with public funding too (potential problems with **all** research) but they are much less than solely private funding / lobbying.  Also considering these papers fly in the face of normal virological fear porn, I thought them both (actually they are part of a larger set) absolutely fascinating for their ramifications - that viruses typically perceived as solely pathogenic may imbue **positive** traits on the receiving organism.  I'd suggest you think on that for at least a few minutes.  Maybe a few years \ud83d\ude0a",

I personally am Conservative so am team Trump, he spoke his mind, took no shite, did great with the economy, smashed Pedo rings straight away, peace talks in Korea, loads of good stuff people ignore or just don't know about, love him of hate hm.. He can't be bought as he's already a Billionaire, his Presidential power had limits with all the GOP sabotage and MSM, nay, FBI, being against him with spying and fake dossiers, but the boy done good.\n\nMy point being he was an outsider, if Bounie Saandas ran, he would have been an outsider on the Dems side, but compared to that vile witch Hillary I'd vote Bernice, probably would have won.. Like Andrew Yang, he's an outsider, on tge Dem team, not sure if he's running but I like him.. I do hope Trump runs, all this Tricky Dicky FBI raid nonsense is just mud throwing, as per, seeing how much will stick given people's short memories it'll probably be a sadly large amount.. \n\nTrump said the FBI were spying on him as a private citizen abd even as President, of course anyone agreeing were conspiracy theorists.  Now they actually admitted it? Well, it's been memory holed, nobody cares.. Raiding Trumps home for anything illegal while Hillary brags about her illegal use of servers to send emails.. If it were you or I the average person doing that we'd get hung..\n\nThe old slag knows she's untouchable and rubs it in your face. Reminds me of the cockyness of the pedophile, boy loving pizzagate types videos online before people got wise.. Not that they're linked in any way of course (people smuggling aides Hillary ahem)!",

Trump goes into a bunker scared when peaceful protestors knocked over a barricade while peacefully protesting.  Trump is a pussy.  I just read the Washington Post report cause I\u2019d never even heard of \u201cMay 29.\u201d  But Fox News had a different version of what transpired.  Which is what is so insidious in our society.   Two different sources of News.  You & I will never agree.  Trump is fooling you.  He has fooled all his supporters.  January6th was a travesty.  May 29th and knocking down an orange barricade is not Even Close to the Criminal Treasonous Activities that occurred on January6th.  Chanting to Hang Mike Pence. Trying to stop Congress from Certifying a Free & Fair Election, attacking the Capital Police?  Antifa wasn\u2019t at the January6th rally.  All the hearings are on YouTube.  You should watch them.  Trump is a narcissistic terrible human troll who swindlers his followers for money, power & personal gain.   He\u2019s never been a good business man either.   He\u2019s bankrupted every casino he ever opened.   That\u2019s hard to do.  He swindled his contractors too.  Anyone who\u2019s ever worked as a contractor for Trump refuse to vote for him.  You should read up on that- previous employees he has shafted.    \n\nIf you are brave enough, curious enough. Watch the J6 committee hearings.   I read up on\u201dMay 29th\u201d to understand your argument.",

Instead for the ones that had made a career out of it they wouldn't even look at what you had much less hear it or anything, and it wasn't much more accepting for any of the groups I went on to find out. Conspiracies from the past are okay I guess but really there is just one truth that haunts us all and it is the basis for every lie used against us ever so one could argue all the ones underneath are all f_distraction if anything.",

Originally, my plan was to write about the power of alternative energy & I was working on a section on the dangers of nuclear. But, in writing it, I found it to be significantly less dangerous, more effective, & better environmentally than all other options when it comes to powering the world. So, I changed my focus of the paper to be on nuclear entirely. \n\nYes, the paper included/ addressed damages caused by nuclear meltdowns, as well as the problems & solutions in regards to nuclear waste. Remember, I was initially planning to argue *against* nuclear - so, I was specifically looking for data to back that argument up. \n\nWhen you actually examine the data though, all other alternative energies look quaint, & traditional ones downright primitive in comparison. \n \n\n& I wrote this paper years ago so there have been some interesting & significant advancements since then, which have the potential to make nuclear cheaper & safer than it *already is*. \n_____\n\nin the case of Zaporizhzhia, i\u2019m not sure how this is even relevant to nuclear as a power source. Most of the most aggressive countries have nuclear weapons\u2026so how is using a nuclear power plant *as a weapon* any different? \n\nThis is like saying computers are bad because armies can use computers to blow things up even though armies already can use computers to blow things up.\n\nMaybe, what\u2019s really going on, is that the oil & gas industry has conditioned *you* to speak poorly of nuclear power plants on their behalf.",

I just scroll on by \\*insert generic republic stupid meme here\\* on political 'humor' instead of bitching about it. And the shit you don't like to see is such a small part of the site. If anything, I blame admins banning certain subs, leading to folks spilling over here. Well, that and how ridiculously shady the last election was.",

So i was like \"dude, you sound just like them, are you sure youre on the right team\" and got banned instantly and my comment removed by him for \"personal attacks\".\n\nIve noticed they will say harrassment is not allowed, yet you see a bunch of people attack others relentlessly and if you report them you will usually get the \"we didnt find anything wrong with their comment\". But if you point it out in the comments, you get brigaded. \n\nSo harrassment is allowed just when its from one specific side to the other. And if you stand on the middle and criticize it, you're wrong. It just helps keep the division going.",

Everyone who has been in this sub for longer than 6 months, KNOWS FOR A FACT, that there is and has been something EXTREMELY scummy going on with modern vaccines, and yet we've had a bunch of blatant shills come in and \"roast Conservatives\" anytime a vaccine related topic is brought up...instead of putting forward any sort of legitimate discussion.\n\nOf course we've had a lot of people spam non-articles on the topic...but even the super legitimate posts about vaccines get raided by what can only be described as shills spamming spiteful \"wHy aReNt wE aLl dEd yEt??\" comments when several people, including children, have passed due to side effects. I don't understand why it would be such a stretch to say that the same thing happens in other topics, such as Trump controversies, which are extremely profitable topics to any sort of paid bot farm.",

Initially, the program was developed as a psychological weapon and was first used in Iraq. In 2011, the US government signed a $2.8 million contract with the Ntrepid web-security company to develop a specialized software, allowing agents of the government to post propaganda. The aim of the initiative is to use sockpuppets to spread pro-American propaganda on social networking services.\n\nMain characteristics of the software, as stated in the software development request, are:\n\nFifty user \"operator\" licenses, 10 sockpuppets controllable by each user.\n\nSockpuppets are to be \"replete with background, history, supporting details, and cyber presences that are technically, culturally and geographically consistent.\" Sockpuppets are to \"be able to appear to originate in nearly any part of the world.\"\n\nA special secure VPN, allowing sockpuppets to appear to be posting from \"randomly selected IP addresses,\" in order to \"hide the existence of the operation.\"\n\nFifty static IP addresses to enable government agencies to \"manage their persistent online personas,\" with identities of government and enterprise organizations protected which will allow for different state agents to use the same sockpuppet, and easily switch between different sockpuppets to \"look like ordinary users as opposed to one organization.\"\n\nNine private servers, \"based on the geographic area of operations the customer is operating within and which allow a customer's online persona(s) to appear to originate from.\" These servers should use commercial hosting centers around the world.\n\nVirtual machine environments, deleted after each session termination, to avoid interaction with \"any virus, worm, or malicious software.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Earnest_Voice\n\nAlso:\n\nhttps://www.darpa.mil/program/social-media-in-strategic-communication\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-sponsored_Internet_propaganda\n\nAnd\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_farm\n\nThe show Homeland touched on this: https://youtu.be/owIsqj1Y1sk\n\n----\n\n>The largest undercover force the world has ever known is the one created by the Pentagon over the past decade.

Network and USAGM officials said that previous members of USAGM leadership took several actions that did not align with USAGM's firewall principles. According to USAGM, the firewall protecting the networks' independence is central to the credibility and effectiveness of USAGM's networks (see fig.).

When Bill Gates and the Koch brothers get together in  the yearly Bilderburger meeting, they don't have a left or a right agenda, they are only there to further the agenda of themselves and those of there ilk. The rich want to keep getting richer and they create conflict and war to make sure the profits keep rolling in from the security contractors, the defense contracts, the weapons factories, and the big pharmaceutical companies that keep the pills flowing. If we the middle ground, middle class, middle of the road citizens ever decided to stand up and fight back as one, those in power would be helpless to try and stop us. So when the bots on the left and the bots on the right start responding to posts about conspiracies keep in mind, they're doing it to keep us divided, because they fear us coming together more than they fear the God they deny exists.",

Then as soon as the account goes active, BAM, active as fuck on mostly this sub Reddit or others conspiracy subs.  Some exceptions to this one, sometimes these accounts will make a random comment or post before the period of dormancy in a totally random sub.  Always just once or twice and that\u2019s it.\n\nAnother user here also pieces together that a lot of accounts on this sub are the same person.

I mean, you could format a bunch of cherry picked sources and conjecture about Bigfoot being real if you wanted to. That's literally all they're doing - presenting a bunch of one-sided bunk as something more than it is and making it look fancy for the plebs.\n\nThere are a few accounts that do the exact same thing now, same exact format and everything, all pushing the same narrative.\n\n// Edit, actually just checked, dude is still at it.

In the prevax era in the US, virtually every child caught measles- millions of cases per year, and the average measles-related death toll was 450. Given the advances in medical care in the last 50 years, the mortality rate would obviously be much lower- in fact WHO maintains that a simple Vit A supplement will decrease complications by 50%, so deaths would be deceased by much more than that. \n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html\n\n>\"In the decade before 1963 when a vaccine became available, nearly all children got measles by the time they were 15 years of age.

When disease spreads, it adapts and strengthens itself in order to better perpetuate itself, like any living species does.\n\nSo, when a large enough amount of the population has the vaccine, the disease cannot spread, it cannot grow, and it cannot overcome the vaccine.\n\nHowever, when the disease is allowed to spread and grow without much resistance, it will eventually spread to enough vaccinated people that it overcomes the vaccine and still infects a member or two of the greater population.\n\nHere's where the danger starts, and here's how someone who refuses vaccinates puts everyone else at risk:\n\nIf enough people refuse vaccines, it spread to enough vaccinated people, and eventually it overcomes that vaccine in a vaccinated person. That person then becomes a carrier for a new, vaccine resistant strain of the disease.\n\nThus rendering everyone else's vaccines less effective. ",

It was examining antibiotics and vitamin A to reduce measles complications.\n\n- \u201cThis review suggests that there is a beneficial effect of antibiotic administration for children with measles in reducing the incidence of complications such as pneumonia, otitis media and tonsillitis. There is no consensus as to the type of antibiotics, duration, time of antibiotic initiation or dosage in this review, although penicillin and co\u2010trimoxazole were found to be effective.\u201d\n\n- \u201cFurther trials are needed to evaluate the type and duration of antibiotics which are known to be effective. Available evidence suggests that two doses of vitamin A given to children below two years of age with measles may reduce mortality.\u201d\n\nThe second [source](https://www.who.int/immunization/newsroom/MI_Fact%20Sheet_17_jan_2007.pdf) stated \u201cThe Initiative\u2019s strategy of reaching more than 90 percent of targeted children in a short period of time through vaccination campaigns has been so successful that other health interventions such as insecticide-treated bed nets for malaria prevention, Vitamin A supplements, and de-worming medicine have been included in these campaigns.\u201d along with 2 other statements about vaccines. \n\n> **In 1980,** 2.6 million people died of it,[6] and in 1990, 545,000 died; by 2014, global vaccination programs had reduced the number of deaths from measles to 73,000.[8][13] \n\nGlobal deaths vs United States deaths in 1980, 1990, and 2014. Estimate of 500 deaths each year \u2014 a 0.1% death rate. (Source Above)\n\n> Rates of disease and deaths, however, increased in 2017 due to a decrease in immunization.[14] \n\n- \u201cReported measles cases spiked in 2017, as **multiple countries** experienced severe and protracted outbreaks of the disease. This is according to a new report published today by leading health organizations. \n\n- Because of gaps in vaccination coverage, measles outbreaks occurred in **all regions,** while there were an estimated 110 000 deaths related to the disease.\u201d\n\nDoes the [2017 measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/images/trends-measles-cases.png) outbreak chart seem irregular? Nobody died in 2017 in the US. \n\nMore global stats. Doesn\u2019t faze me one bit. \n\n> The risk of death among those infected is about **0.2%,**[5] but may be up to **10% in people with malnutrition.**[6] Most of those who die from the infection are less than five years old.[6] Measles is not believed to affect other animals.[6] \"\n\nVery important point on how malnutrition may increase the mortality rate up to 10% for those infected. Hence more people dying in countries with higher malnutrition rates. [(1)](https://www.unicef.org/wca/malnutrition)\n\n______\n\nThe car analogy was to compare death by measles to getting in your car everyday. You have a better chance of dying in a car crash than dying by measles. Make sure to never drive or get in a car.\n\n# \u25c9\ufe35\u25c9 \u25c9\ufe35\u25c9 \u25c9\ufe35\u25c9",

He's allergic/ very sensitive to needles or whatever. He *can't* get vaccines.\n\nIf my kid is to go off to school every day in a school of 300 other kids with a 95% of them being vaccinated and of those 95%, 85% of their vaccinations were effective (the lower predicted threshold for vaccine immunity effectivity) then there would be 242 healthy, uninfectable children. \n\nMy kid, in a class of 20 other kids, is probably one of 4 non vaccinated children (242/300= ~80%, 16/20 = 80%). \n\nNow let's say someone at my kids school has measles and that kid goes out to recess and plays with 30 other kids, giving off pathogens to each of the kids. Assuming my kid was not one of the 30, the odds of one of the 30 kids with the pathogen being in his class is 10% and the odds of said kid being non vaccinated or vaccinated with no immunity would be 20%. Therefore there is a 2% chance that someone in my kids class would go home at the end of the day and come home the next day with measles for show and tell.\n\nIf you increase the effectiveness of a vaccine, the percentages for falling I'll decrease, even if you are unvaccinated. This also applies to increasing the percentage of people that are vaccinated.\n\nVaccinations pose short term pain (poked in the arm, in rare cases major symptoms) for long term health (of both the individual and the population).\nThank you.",
