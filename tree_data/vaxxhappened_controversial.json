What happens if you loose it, or it gets wet, or set on fire?  You can't easily replace it since it's issued to you at time of vaccination.  Some countries don't have a universal passport yet, and some countries don't want one period.  How do you handle that?

It wasn't in NA originally, it spread though travellers, and shipped goods.  \n\nThe problem is not limited to just one country, and starting a war with one another is bad enough without ignoring the fact that problem is in more then one country.",

How many millions of lives need to be lost before we say *enough is enough?*\n\n**We are now morally obligated to be ANTI-anti-vaxx.** What does it mean to be ANTI-anti-vaxx?\n\n- If someone can read a comment of yours (anywhere, but *especially* in this subreddit) without immediately knowing how strongly you feel about people who are anti-vaccine and anti-science, then you're *not* ANTI-anti-vaxx.\n\n- If people around you (online **or** IRL) make anti-vaxx insinuations, or express any hesitancy in agreeing with you about the unparalleled importance of pro-vaccine policy -- and you neglect to force the issue and debunk their anti-vaxx nonsense with science -- then you're *not* ANTI-anti-vaxx.\n\n- If the thought of getting your Delta booster jab causes you trepidation or makes you say \"Maybe I'll just wait and see what happens\", then you're *not* ANTI-anti-vaxx.\n\n- If you associate -- in an amicable **or** neutral manner -- with anybody who has not received at least two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine (regardless if they claim \"medical exemptions\" or any other such nonsense), then you're *not* ANTI-anti-vaxx.\n\nI could continue this list, but I'm sure you all get the point.\n\nMods, I respectfully and strongly recommend that you begin removing **all content** that is not ANTI-anti-vaxx, and banning repeat offenders of non-ANTI-anti-vaxx content. \n\nIf we won't all commit to fighting for the truth in this world, then we shouldn't be surprised if we wake up one day with no truth, and no world, left to fight for.\n\nDo the right thing."

You can find this phenomenon all over reddit and pretty much any other social media platform, and it's inevitable if people with similar interests come together. My advice would be to either ignore it or study neurobiology and come up with a \"cure\" for human tribalism, it would probably benefit us all. :)\n\nYou should also keep in mind that the average person is not scientifically literate enough to back up their claims by citing credible sources, and even if they can do it, they're often too lazy, especially since it's the internet, so nobody really cares. What would help would be a rule that forces you to show evidence, as well as a tutorial on how to do it in a pinned post.

That is the key part; in vaccinated people.\nThere is nothing wrong with the vaccine but when it comes to infectious diseases it needs to be looked at from a population standpoint.  \n\nThe issue is that chickenpox is worse in adults than in kids. If about half of the population gets vaccinated it will reduce natural chickenpox a lot. This is initially great but after a couple of years there will be enough unvaccinated adults to have an outbreak in the adult population. This brings along more deaths, disability and even disabled kids if the mother got it during pregnancy. Since the original trial it has also been shown that the immunity is possibly not life long as was initially expected and vaccination in kids increases the amount of shingles in people who went trough the disease before vaccines were around. All of this can be solved with more vaccines but this also costs more money. The issue is that not a single country wants to spend this much money on a disease that had a mortality of less then 1/ 100 000 before vaccination. Instead of a reduction in medical costs the vaccine has caused an (temporary?) increase. We just need to wait to see if this is temporary and the issue will sort itself out as the people who were not vaccinated die off over the next 60 years or if this becomes the new norm. It is not known yet and I can see why some people believe the issue will sort itself out. \n\nTo sumarise: there is nothing wrong with the vaccine, just with how it is used. When used to protect adults is has the biggest return on investment looking at the current data but this might be different when looked at over a 50-100 year time-frame. ",

Not debate around with artificial \"facts\" and scary stories and be just another polarized group without any real merit. We should try to educate people instead of drowning them out. We should learn about the mistakes made by the antivax not copy them. \n\nMy apologies for the rant, I really needed to get this off my chest. Feel free to discuss anything I said here or add to it. Contrary to vaccine safety and disease mortality there are not many facts here and it is an almost pure block of opinion. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit, dammit I messed up the title."

So there can be no single cause.  \nBut we do know some risk factors: for example, there is a genetic component to it, and the risk goes up with the age of the parents. We also now know that whatever the cause is, autism is something you are born with, which is another nail in the coffin for blaming vaccines - they're simply too late to be the cause.

Clinically not only do they lie about medical history but they also are non-compliant when it comes to actual medical care when there is disease onset (for example refusal to give medication to the diseased infant).\n\nFor full honesty most of the effects of the anti vaxx movement will only come to full bloom in about 10 years and some of these children enter adulthood.\nThe rest is felt every day by hospital professionals and children that are in fragile states of immunity and that can't be protected via vaccine.\n\nWorking in science nowadays and attempting to communicate with laymen is disheartening.\n\nThe sumation of all human knowledge lives in our pockets and people still choose to go with non science supported themes.\n\nTo add that the current opinion on why underprivileged countries are more compliant with vaccination programmes stems from the fact that medical record protection is iffy and death in childhood is something that is seen every day. \n\nI can go down to peds and make videos of the sub 2 year olds that are in the infecto-ward but I would lose my job, can also guarantee that like most parents before what is happening in those rooms and the parental responsibility  will be kept under rugs, perpetuating this malarkey.\n\nAnd if in doubt here is one example provided by a parent:\nhttps://youtu.be/zuK4honWVsE\n\nAbility to feed is affected\n\n\nAbility to play and progress cognitively is affected \n\n\nAbility to socialize is affected \n\n\nWell being is affected.\n\n\nThis is preventable.\n\n\nIt might not be a deadly disease for most but the effect is nefarious and and obstacle to a development in full potential.\n\nAlso in full disclaimer: I work in the us but am from a country with universal healthcare. There is no real \"medical industry\" or \"big pharma\" it is ilegal to advertise medication since health is not considered a business and the medical care and schedule is simply designed to reduce the amount of time people have to spend in hospitals so health care doesn't create an even bigger governmental budget hole.\n\n\nAnd since I am on the internet I can actually say what I think: this crunchy anti-vaxx bullshit is a medal that science uneducated people use while refusing their own role on the poor care they are providing to their children. These unvaxxed children are effectively excluded to many other types of future care in case it is needed, like organ transplants (being donors or receivers), access to higher, better quality education (for example TA'ing is incredibly valuable and an indicator of good future employment and not allowed to non vaxxers ).\n\n\nThe effect of childhood adversity (disease is one form of adversity) is devastating:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3680281/\n\nAnd we have a current ongoing unwanted human experiment going on on what are the differences between populations that go through good care vs bad care:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/18647440/\n\nNorth Koreans are the only population in the world with size regression.",

Doctors actually receive very little training on vaccines. Generally they are just given a schedule and told to follow it. There are a lot of questions surrounding the vaccine industry. They are not regulated like regular drugs. Just the fact that a bill was passed in the 90's which essentially made it impossible to sue vaccine companies should raise some eyebrows. Furthermore the government has set up a trust fund that is used to settle cases of vaccine damage. Obviously the big pharma is going to love vaccines because they are a cash cow with little regulation and zero liability. There have been a lot of studies that show a correlation between modern day diseases and vaccinations. Is this causation? That is the question. Fact is there are a lot of potentially toxic ingredients that could be more harmful than good. In the pre 80's autism was very rare like 1 on 15k. Now it's like one in 15 (stats may be a little off but you get the point). I guess the point is that this is a debate worth having. Remember those really long commercials on tv for all these great new medications, that's where stations get a lot of their funding, so just because you don't hear news stories about the possibility that vaccines may not be great is because they will not risk losing funding. I have a new son, and have been looking into the matter for that reason. It's actually pretty scary when you see the facts and statistics. Not saying don't vaccinate, but maybe some vaccines are much more dangerous than others and maybe giving your 2 month old 9 doses at a time is not a good idea. "
