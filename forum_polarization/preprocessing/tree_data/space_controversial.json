We are also lucky that in the near vicinity of us, it seem to be extra calm.

And we tried hard to create life in laboratory, but struck nothing. All life was single cell for an very long time, and before photosynthesis a couple of ages more passed. What life we got now is a product of several mass extinctions, mutations, fluke incidents and isolated events. We might have arrived to where we are extremely quick under incredible low odds. And question is. Will we survive the mass extinction we're currently in?\n\nToday I would be very surprised if we share the galaxy with a more advanced civilisation.

It only makes sense on Mars because Mars is so far away from the nearest petroleum reservoir.  And so, using 100X the energy per unit energy out, makes sense.  Or whatever the ratio is.\n\nBut that's never going to make financial sense on Earth while the Earth has significant petroleum reserves.  And since making it cheaper is the paramount mission, it seems very unlikely that Elon is ever going to use that stuff for Starship here on Earth in any sort of significant manner if at all.\n\nAnd speaking of economies of scale, thousands of Starships going to Mars will require however many thousands or tens of thousands of refueling flights each emitting monstrous amounts of additional C02 into the atmosphere.\n\nPerhaps even to the extent that Starship and the Mars endeavor ends up showing up on the largest emitters lists.",

I am personally confident that this is a stopgap until that comes online, because Starship wouldn't make sense if it weren't.\n\n>And when you're burning such a monstrous amount of fuel to save a few bucks\n\n\"A few bucks\" is a bit of an understatement. Musk says it could lower the launch cost per kilogram to LEO to $10/kg. That seems like pure bullshit to me, given the price of methane, but even conservative estimates say it could be reduced to [\\~$272/kg](https://thespacereview.com/article/3740/1). Right now, it's about 10 times that.\n\nMoreover, Starship operates under [economies of scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale); it being large makes it more CO2-efficient. Essentially, 1 Starship launch that puts 10 units of mass in orbit emits the CO2 equivalent of 9 smaller rockets designed to put 1 unit of mass in orbit each. It's arguably the *most* CO2-efficient rocket there is, other than something like SLS, simply because it's so large - and I have no clue how SLS's side boosters do in terms of CO2 emissions. Probably not great, given the polybutadiene acrylonitrile/ammonium perchlorate they burn, [which might cause acid rain as well.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_perchlorate_composite_propellant#Environmental_and_other_concerns)\n\nOh, and Starship is supposed to be entirely reusable, meaning that the massive CO2 costs of building a new rocket aren't there each time it launches.",

So my family has done all these things, but that is not 0.001% of what musk and his team have done. I just don\u2019t like miss information. And I agree he should prioritize world hunger and such instead of buying Twitter but that money has to go somewhere so the recipients of that money could solve world hunger too. It\u2019s a cycle you see. And if you take the conservative estimate of 8 billion to solve world hunger, then why haven\u2019t the countries of the world don it?

Have a \"Meatless Monday\". One day of your week eating healthy fruits and vegetables will help. You might be wondering, how in the world with *that* help? Less purchases means less demand. Less demand means less production. The dairy and beef industry are responsible for so much deforestation and pollution. It's insane. So every little bit helps. Not everyone has to make huge changes in their life (for now), the more people who make little changes will help instead of a few making big changes in their lives. Car pooling. Taking the bus. Electric car.\n\nThese are all solutions off the top of my head. A quick google search and I could probably come up with more for you. But I encourage you to find solutions that work best for you and the environment. It doesn't take a lot of effort to do something about climate change. Helping however you can helps.\n\nBecause many people not doing anything is hurting more than we can imagine.\n\n\\*cough\\* and holding major corporations and businesses accountable for their fair share, pollution tax \\*cough\\*",

At the risk of being downvoted because I didn't do any reasearch and figured I would ask instead, don't the batteries for the cars cause a whole new issue once they're depleted? Do we have a good way to recycle them or is that a future problem? If so how big could that be?

IE - creation of Solar panels for interstellar Space probes since the conception of NASA and its equivalents. There is a huge incentive within the space industry to create more and more efficient solar panels which by far outclasses older designs as well as making them affordable (to anyone). By removing funding from Spaceflight, you completely kill a massive chunk of the incentive to develop solar power. \n\nDesalination and treatment of polluted waters has been a massive topic researched by all major space agencies including NASA and Roscosmos. Such technology has always and will always be a major prerequisite for ISRU (in situ resource utilization) on other planets/moons. Both have always been intrinsically tied. And technological derivatives sprouted from such research and R&D are the reason people in third world countries are afforded the luxaries of cheaply resourced potable water from polluted lakes etc.\n\nCarbon Capture is something which could be extremely beneficial to the environment, especially with climate change looming. It is something which has always been sought after by different space agencies or space companies simply due to its nature as a prerequesite technology needed to make rocket fuels, or procure basic but important natural resources. This technology has yet to be demonstrated, but shall we as humans invest in space - we will surefire unlock Carbon Capture and its spinoff derivatives against climate change which would be for the good of everyone.\n\nNASA also heavily invests in technologies which enable the effective growth of crops from soils which are otherwise inhospitable for most crops. See the recent news about NASA growing the first crops out of lunar soil. \nAlso NASA technologies, and the concept of vertical farming has closely been attributed to technologies needed in space for long distance trips to other worlds. spinoffs are already benefiting us as a humankind.\n\nYou can thank a lot of your modern day amenities and technologies to developments in space travel. Had we never had any of these and never tried for the moon. We'd still be using abacuses and factory sized computers to calculate 2 decimal, people would still be clueless on how to purify water for poor nations, we'd still be relying on Exxon or BP, still be using landlines, have no idea what the weather will be, be clueless to natural disasters and famines, and most of all you wouldn't be here typing on reddit let alone you wouldn't have enough money to buy anything more technologically advanced than several diodes on a table sized circuitboard.\n\nAlso as for the last part, we can also thank private companies for shouldering much of the costs of what would otherwise have been public funds for space travel. You don't need to taxpay them. They need the technology anyways. Let them shoot for it. Imagine not having to pay tax for a +$9 billion dollar moonbase. That's great.",

It might well too be the most important material resource in the future exploration of the solar system. The polar ice is a potential source of fuel, and it's difficult to describe how valuable a source of fuel off of earth could be. Beyond that, if we can use lunar regolith to someday manufacture inhabitable vessels, it could usher in a bright new era where future spacecraft can be practically any size, space stations big as football stadiums.

I think that's our greatest hurdle with the vast distances and time spans involved in space exploration, we can barely plan past a four-year election cycle, much less our own lifespans. Assuming you could accelerate a probe to such a speed to get there in a matter of a few decades, you also have to carry enough propellant to slow it down if you want anything more than snapping a few pics as it blasts by. Probably the best solution is sending out slow, self-replicating probes that are automated by AI to exponentially expand through the galaxy. The technology isn't there yet, and you still won't see data within your natural life span, but it would benefit humanity in the future.\n\nAs far as manned exploration, again our life span is a big limiting factor. Assuming you solved the issues of food, radiation, fuel, and building an adequately sized ship, you would still be dead long before reaching another star. Colony ships may be a solution, but there's an ethical dilemma of condemning multiple generations of unborn humans to living their entire existence in a metal can floating through the void without their consent.\n\nI hope we discover a better solution, we've been capable of huge technological leaps in relatively short time periods in the past, but as it stands now I don't see any way that anyone alive today will see the fruits of exploring another solar system. I think the most likely way is if we figure out how to upload our minds to computers and essentially become immortal, then we could send human minds to explore the galaxy, or be around to witness the results of robotic explorations. Beyond that, we'd have to find a way around the currently understood laws of physics to accomplish much. Likely our best bet for the next few hundred years is working on colonizing our own solar system.",

I truly feel sorry for people who are incapable of seeing past the tribalism of identity politics to experience the awe and pride at what humanity accomplished so many years ago. We should celebrate every person who lands on the moon until it is so commonplace that no one will bother dragging that baggage to the Moon with them anymore, but let's not diminish what was done or dehumanize those who did it simply because vestigial in/out group-think from the caves still plagues the modern mind.",

They track down Argentinians who have succeeded elsewhere, and then publish those news, as if they said anything good about Argentinians or Argentina.\n\nGuess what? It's the opposite. There was a very prominent Argentinian-born American immigrant that was quite crucial in the Apollo program (main designer of the AGC), and the media here loves to talk about him. Guess what? That says good things about him in particular, and good things about the USA, but certainly nothing good about Argentina, that doesn't even have a real space program.\n\nRam\u00f3n Alonso had to escape Argentina because the peronist party persecuted him, he was a refugee in the USA. Him being an important figure in the Apollo program doesn't say good things about Argentina, it says awful things about it. Had he remained here, he couldn't have gone to MIT, or succeed the way he did.\n\nThis Palestinian women that the news so proudly parades would've been shamed (or worse) in Palestine for even daring to dress like she's in the photo. Women in Palestine have very few rights, and are seen as second class citizens.\n\nThey've done the same with Elon. Guess what? He had to leave because he didn't have a future in South Africa.\n\nEDIT: This comment was deleted, HOW IS THAT NOT CENSORSHIP?",

America has accomplished some great things in the last century, but some Americans tend to brush off the accomplishments of other nations as inferior, while claiming we won this or we're the best at that. Only looking at certain events in history that suit your narrative, while conveniently ignoring others, is insulting.\nAmerica won the cold war and they sent a man to the moon. But they didn't win the space race because arguably, it didn't end when they put a man on the moon, it wasn't the finish line, just a goal post. The term 'soace race' was coined long before America planned on stepping on the moon.\n\nI feel the same when I see some Americans disrespect the achievements and sacrifices of the Allies and Russians when commenting about WW2. I have admiration for America, but not respect.\n\nEdit. Yes, NASA is awesome",

US launch, satellite and space probe technology dwarfed anything the USSR could put out by the mid 60s. They did so with a program that had democratic civilian over site, was open to the public about what it was doing and what its plans were. Soyuz was massively inferior to the Saturn I let alone the Saturn V. Also in 1967 Vladimir Komarov was killed by a malfunctioning parachute due to the hasty nature of the Soviet space program. His death and the failure of the N1 launch vehicle scuttled the Soviet lunar program. It was real, they had invested huge money in it but it was a failure. Salyut was something they threw together as an emergency project to try to cover for their failures in the Moon. \n\nThe US had had plans for a space station since the early 60s, the Air Force were far along with their Manned Orbital Laboratory project in the late 60s when it was realised technology had advanced to a stage that the testing it was supposed to do on reconnaissance equipment could be done automatically. \n\nSkylab emerged from the Apollo Applications Program. The program that became Skylab was being worked on in 1967/8. This is all very open and public. When Apollo was scaled back, booster became available and one of these was converted into Skylab in 1969. The contracts were open and public BEFORE Salyut I was launched. \n\n> Skylab, which crashed. So the Russians made Mir, the first modular space station which made way for the ISS. \n\nThe Soviets made many stations, often these were the military Almaz stations as their technology was not as advanced as the US and they needed people to do what automation was doing in the US (hence the cancelled MOL project).\n\nYou seem to know very little of space history and have invented a whole lot of nonsense that is contrary to the very public history of these programs.",

The Soviets had one, that had massively over specified the weight of the weapon they were developing. So the R7 rocket was massively bigger than US rockets and actually utterly useless as an ICBM (it was quickly replaced by a smaller rocket in that role). This meant that they had a much larger throw weight\\\\launch capability than the US vehicles that were optimised for much smaller payloads at sub orbital trajectories. \n\nThe competing US launch vehicles had some very public failures before Sputnik. Then the us manned program, built around the small Redstone rocket to begin with (two manned suborbital flights) appeared weak when compared with the Soviets high risk fight flight of Gagarin. \n\nThe US drew level with a larger booster (that had always been the plan) the Atlas (descendants of that are still flying in the ULA Atlas V). The US then moved to its Titan II based rockets for its next manned capsule. This was much larger and allowed them to do far more complex things in space such as practicing docking with the Agena upper stage. The Soviets still went for flashy firsts but were now clearly behind in terms of technology. \n\nThe US had an open capitalist system where companies could pursue their own goals and plans, this allowed the rapid innovation in computing and metallurgy. While the Soviets were centrally directed so far less innovative. The US model was also far better at generating growth to deliver economic surpluses that could be used to fund things like space programs. \n\nThe US threw serious money at its space program and were able to leverage its huge industrial and economic base. People try to make this out as purely propaganda but space based technologies were a huge boost such as geostationary communications and weather satellites. The expectation was that the 70s would see humans moving into space permanently. The \"it was propaganda\" story is a backward looking rewriting of motivations. \n\nBut still having chucked very serious cash as NASA, they could build dedicated, non ICBM derived rockets, the Saturn family. This allowed them to build the competence to rapidly assemble the technologies for a lunar landing. \n\nHowever 1972 was not 1962 politically. People stopped being excited by space and US political internal divisions, post Vietnam weariness, race riots, etc meant the cost of space was seen as not worth the big ticket. So NASA promised to do it all much cheaper on a reusable vehicle: Shuttle. This turned out to be a very bad wrong turn in many ways. \n\nDetente was the reproachment between the US and USSR in the mid 70s so they organised a joint space mission and for a while the competition over all cooled. \n\nThe 80s the idea of space as being hugely costly and the Moon landings as a pure stunt rather than the first step in a permanent settlement had settled in. The Soviets were not able to event think about something as expensive and US spaceflight on Shuttle was horribly over priced and unsafe. Reganism had seen a restarting of rivalry in a big way but this mostly focussed on SDI\\\\Star Wars rather than human accomplishments. That said Shuttle was widely popular and US science was swatting it out the park with missions like Voyagers and the planning for Hubble. \n\nBy the 90s horizons had shrunk so much ISS was dreamed up as something for Shuttle and the Russian space program to do. The Moon looked like a weird aberration. The idea that the space race had been a 60s thing was firm in everyone's minds. \n\nBy the turn of the millennium, cheap access to space was a pipe dream by rocket fanbois and some tech rich kids.......... the story continues from there.",

The Navy and Air Force were larger programs with a more US centric management team. It was decided in the late 50s that the Army had no need for a big ICBM as land based weapons would be Air Force and there would be a submarine based system run by the Navy. So the Redstone Arsenal team were sort of at a loose end when NASA was created. This meant that when the Eisenhower administration was creating a civilian agency, the armies Germans were available. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  In late 1956 the Army was relieved of most of its ballistic missiles in favor of similar weapons operated by the [US Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Air_Force). The German design team was then spun off to become part of the newly founded NASA. Redstone served as the primary site for space [launch vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle) design into the 1960s. \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redstone\\_Arsenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redstone_Arsenal)\n\nThis created a myth that US rocket technology was most Nazis when only the Army team had a significant number of them. On the other hand they were pretty good engineers. The Navies Vanguard rocket was given priority for launch as they did not have the German connections but they had a couple of public failures so the Armies Juno rocket was the first US rocket to orbit. This plus the cancellation of the Armies ICBM prorgam gave the world the view of Germans being the leaders of the US rocket program.",

              "body": "\"Firsts\" aren't necessarily everything, although sometimes they can be important. So, a couple various points:\n\nThe Soviets had really good launch vehicle capabilities early on but they ran into a lot of problems later on (with the N-1, for example). Partly this was due to the nature of Soviet industry and science programs, which were extremely political to the degree that favoritism played a huge role in every single thing constantly. Not that the US didn't have similar problems but they were ultimately not as severely debilitating to innovation and execution as they were in the USSR. The Soviets had the ability to launch payloads pretty effectively but a lot of their spacecraft technology was behind that of the west, and this became more severe over time. Soviet spacecraft tended to use pressurized electronics boxes, and this worked fine for early satellites but overall their systems tended to have a lower service life (of around 12-18 months) while western satellite operational lifetimes kept increasing over time and ultimately became much longer lived and more capable.\n\nIn regard to the \"Space Race\" in particular, the US put forward a huge effort in the Apollo program and it ultimately paid off tremendously in being able to leap-frog the Soviets in major \"firsts\". The US was able to push a lot of new development forward all at the same time: next generation crewed vehicles (Apollo CSM and LM), more operational experience on orbit with crewed spacecraft (the Gemini program), more experience with on orbit rendezvous, new launch vehicles (Saturn IB and Saturn V), and so on. At the same time as the Apollo program had reached a point where it had done nearly half a dozen launches of the heavy lift booster as well as a handful of Apollo missions and was finally in a position to go for a proper landing on the Moon the Soviets were only just stepping up to the plate with their heavy lift launcher (which experienced two launch failures in 1969) and their lunar spacecraft were still years behind schedule. It was only after 1972 that the Soviets even had all of the bits and pieces built and together to plausibly be able to start doing operational missions that would work towards a lunar landing (or could perform a crewed lunar rendezvous) but by then there was little value in continuing with the program, especially given the lack of success they had with the N-1, so they scrapped it.\n\nBy the early 1970s the cadence on spaceflight had changed dramatically and many of the Soviet's early successes were getting eclipsed. By then communications satellites, weather satellites, and Earth observation satellites had started to become mature technologies after the successes of programs like Syncom (geostationary commsats), TIROS/ESSA (weather satellites), Landsat (remote imaging), and others.\n\nAlso through the 1970s the US gained greater and greater sophistication and success with interplanetary missions. The Soviets tried many times to send probes to Mars and met with failure after failure, partly due to the mismatch between the longevity of their spacecraft and the long travel times to Mars (one of the reasons why they had greater success with Venus) while the US began having success with Mars. First with Mariner 4 returning the first close up images of Mars from a flyby, then with Mariner 9 being the first vehicle to successfully orbit another planet and serving as a conduit for our first looks at another planet that we could actually view the surface of from orbit. Then the Viking missions in the mid '70s, serving as the first \"full-court press\" level of exploration of another planet, mapping the entire planet in detail from orbit and sending landers to the surface. Also in the mid/late 1970s Pioneer 10/11 became the first missions to the outer planets, providing the first detailed views of Jupiter and then Saturn and their moons in history, followed shortly thereafter by Voyager 1 & 2 which upped the stakes even more and gave even better looks at the outer planets starting in 1979/'80 (with Voyager 2 continuing on to provide the first and only flyby imagery from Uranus and Neptune in the mid to late '80s).\n\nSo by the mid 1970s there were about a zillion things in terms of spaceflight (exploration or industry) where the examples of the coolest, most interesting, most revolutionary, most record setting, etc. accomplishments were no longer universally Soviet as they had been over a decade earlier, they were almost entirely American or western. And while the Soviets continued to have a perfectly capable space program (with Soyuz and Salyut and Molniya and Luna and Venera and so on) none of it seemed to be at the same level or have the same \"cool factor\" as what NASA was doing.",

Compare that to a several billion dollar startup cost and several million dollar operational cost of fully reusable rockets a la BFR. \n\nI don't know what propellant coming from the Moon would cost, but we know that with the numbers given for BFR the cost of propellant drops to less than $50 per kilogram. Even if SpaceX misses their goal by an order of magnitude, I expect that $500 per kilo propellant delivery to Earth orbit would still be cheaper than Moon propellant.\n\nI'm not poo-pooing Moon exploration and development of course, I'm just thinking along economic lines. Personally I think any Moon colonies should keep any and all water (plus other volatile chemicals) they find to be used inside their habitat spaces, since the Moon as a whole is an incredibly dry desert.

So discarding reliability as a concern, what are the additional problems of sending humans over sending robots? \n\nOne is that humans are more fragile than robots. If people object to the concept of human spaceflight to the moon one thing that they will bring up is radiation exposure - and this is a valid question that has a valid answer (though they tend to discard those answers). \n\nThe other is that humans do need oxygen and water and food. If you want to move a lot of mass to the moon you could, for example, place a spacecraft with high in low earth orbit and presume that you'll spend months in a slow ion spiral widening the orbit until you get a moon intersection. You might not want to do that with humans because of the consumption of food and water taking up a much larger fraction of the payload. \n\n",

This is completely doable.  The use of an SEP (Solar-Electric Propulsion) tug allows for gentle, efficient accelleration.  \n\nYes, actually landing the whole ISS on the moon is virtually impossible.  But it's modular - each chunk being less than 20 tons.  These could be landed individually.  The cost to put them in orbit (at $10,000/pound) easily makes any scheme for using them worth considering.  \n\nRussia already plans to detach its modules and use them for something else if the rest of the ISS nations decide to scrap the station.\n\nThe ISS could easily be moved into a lunar polar orbit, EML1/EML2, or into another Lagrange point using off-the-shelf SEP.  The problem is that it's getting pretty old.  By the time it's decommissioned, it will be losing a lot of functionality.  But the pressure vessels are extremely valuable in space.  I don't think very much of it will be ditched unless there is a major failure.    \n\n",

They didn't cancel Curiousity, even though it went over budget by _double_, they didn't cancel the James Webb telescope even though it's... well, let's just say double would be an understatement. The ISS is going nowhere. Hell, we aren't concerned about getting canceled because of the very little bit they've invested in _us_ (and because, unlike other missions, we're not overbudget). \n\nThat said, once you're past phase A - the concept of operations phase, it becomes more and more painful for congress to cancel a mission. That isn't to say it's unheard of, but the ISS is currently about as likely to get cancelled as Cassini is. That is to say, if they cancel it, it's because something cooler needs funding (see also: the space shuttle).",

What is not designed for high loads are the connectors between each module or truss section.  The connection between two of the pressurized modules is 16 x 1/2 inch bolts (driven by individual motors).  That is strong enough to prevent leaks between the modules, but its not enough to hold them together when the whole station is undergoing landing forces.\n\nIndividual systems, like the fluid loops (ammonia and water cooling) needed to function in zero gee, but could only be tested on Earth in 1 gee.  So we cleverly rotated the modules in their support stand, and tested them upside down as well as right side up.  If they function at both +1 and -1g, then probably they also work at 0g in between. (I used to work for Boeing testing space station hardware).\n\nPutting a module on the Moon brings up how you walk, and how you replace an equipment rack.  In zero gee, the astronauts float, so there is no floor as such, and equipment racks are on all 4 sides of the aisle.  Racks just float when you need to replace them.  On the Moon we would need to add floor panels, and a lift for the heavier racks (up to 800 kg).  On the Moon they would still be too heavy for hand lifting.  We had both in the clean room, to install equipment, since we were doing it in 1 gee.  But the modules as they are now could not be used on the Moon without some additions and mods.\n\nWhenever NASA is done with the current station, I say use it as an orbital testbed for reboost and other technology, or sell it off to commercial users.  It would be a shame to just re-enter it or destroy it.",

Nuclear reactor would probably be required = political no-go.\n\nThe shielding of ISS is not sufficient for deep space rad environment.\n\nSetting it on the Lunar surface is pure fantasy and would be far too dangerous to ever get the go-ahead.  The systems required would cost billions to develop, test and fly.\n\nRealistically, parts of the station can be dismantled and sent with ion drives to lunar orbit or lagrange points, but BEO resupply would still be required and shielding would be inadequate for the radiation levels.  Again, more new modules would be required.  Then again, ISS is not designed to be disassembled either and this would be extremely difficult.  \n\nThe question is similar to fans of using the Shuttle to go to Moon.

You need big rockets to soft-land something on the Moon since it has no atmosphere. The Apollo LM weighed 14 tons of which 8 tons was the descent stage. The ISS weighs 450 tons; I'm guessing you'd need at least a 200 ton descent stage. This is in addition to the huge amount of fuel required to get it into lunar orbit. For reference, the shuttle had a payload size of just 24 tons.\n\nA much more reasonable plan would simply be to push it up to a parking orbit. This could be done relatively easily using ion propulsion, using much less fuel. I have always been a proponent of this idea. However, owing to the sheer size of the station such a system would still be incredibly complex and expensive, and it's not clear what the reasons for doing this would be. The ISS is a complex machine and you can't just let it hang out by itself. It needs constant maintenance otherwise it becomes unlivable and unserviceable. There are currently no planned manned missions to the Moon or anywhere else and so it might take 10 or 20 years for a parked ISS to become useful again.",

First, let's remember that the ISS is a very large spacecraft with many pieces that would survive reentry and hit the ground. For that reason if there is a risk of reentry due to abandonment then the only responsible thing to do is make sure that the reentry is controlled and occurs over an unpopulated area, otherwise innocent people could die.\n\nSecond, let us remember the pesky bit of basic math and orbital mechanics. It will take far, far fewer resources to deorbit the ISS than to place it in a higher orbit that will take longer to decay. More so, the idea of launching the ISS toward the Moon is sheer insanity. Firstly, it would require putting into orbit and docking to the ISS one or more rocket stages with a total mass *twice* that of the ISS. That would require something like 17 Falcon Heavy launches at a cost of $2 billion for the launches alone (independent of the cost of developing and building the special rocket stages). Oh, but wait, there's more to this lunacy. You say you don't just want to put the ISS into orbit around the moon, you want to *land* it? Well, let's see, we'll need a fueled rocket that weighs about as much as the ISS to do that, plus however much the landing \"frame\" weighs. Oh, and now we've doubled the mass we need to send to the moon so it'll require a rocket twice as large to push it there. Now we're talking about $5 billion in launch costs alone and easily that much or more in the costs of all this hardware.\n\nMeanwhile, we've put five times the mass of the ISS into orbit with a plethora of launches and at billions of dollars of expense, does anyone see a funny little problem with that? Such as perhaps, maybe, using those resources to simply put another space station (at this rate, one 5 times as massive as the ISS) into orbit.\n\nThird, there's a catch-22. Even if you take the vastly more sane approach of merely pushing the ISS into a higher, longer lived orbit you basically force it to be mothballed and unusable, because then it becomes out of reach for at the very least the Russian resupply vessels.\n\nFourth, the ISS is in no way a good moon base, period, full stop.\n\nNo, none of this fantasy makes sense. What makes sense is to push for continuing ISS operations for as long as conceivably possible and then deorbiting the thing safely when it has reached its end of life.",

Nasa should devise a plan to retrofit the entire station as completed to sit on a carefully engineered frame the way a kit home sits on a raised frame/foundation. Fit boosters that will get it to the moon and land safely to permanently sit there as a base. This plan obviously has some inbuilt complexity but surely cost wise it's a better investment than: Destroying something we've spent billions of dollars and decades to build. 2. Spending yet more decades and more billions at some point in the future to assemble a base either on the moon or mars anyway (which will probably constitute modules of the same scope and specification)\n\nI'd argue the biggest part of such a project is already complete. The ISS is complete (well almost) and its already up there. Now I'm not saying it will be easy, for example the solar arrays might have to be temporarily detached whilst the station is moved and landed but we've gone so far I don't see what can possibly stop such a thing from working.\n\nI suggest the moon because of its lower gravity / closeness it would be a feasible plan. One could make the case for shipping the thing to Mars! but of course this raises greater challenges (like trying to land something that weighs 450tonnes and having foundations strong enough to support such a landing) But I'm sure the engineers amongst us would salivate at the potential challenge of doing so.\n\nSo what do we say reddit?\n\n1. Destroy it at a double cost (the money spent gone and the opportunity to use what we've built gone with it) Plus the cost in starting a 'base/outpost' project from scratch.\n\nor\n\n2. Spend a few more billion and have a moon base (or mars base) within the next 10-15years?\n\nSeems pretty clear cut.",

That's a lunar eclipse, and it doesn't happen every month due to the slight tilt of the lunar orbit relative to the ecliptic (which is the orbit of the Earth around the Sun). That is, the sun would only blot out when the full moon matches up with the time that the moon in its orbit passes through the plane of the ecliptic. This occurs at only a fraction of full moons (else we'd have a lunar eclipse every month).",

In addition, when the Sun is only 10\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 above the horizon, features less than 0.5 m high can be identified by their long shadows. The LROC NAC will detect blocks with ~1m horizontal scale and heights less than 0.5 m.\n\none more bit: http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/24-Narrow-Angle-Cameras-NAC.html - the LROC narrow-angle camera's telescope has only a 7.7 inch aperture.",

The other reasons for it being popular in the news are because of interest in our effect on the environment around Earth and the danger that untracked objects can pose to things in orbit of the Earth. If we know the mass and velocity of impact then we can calculate a precise estimate of the kinetic energy of the impact. We can photograph the region where it is going to impact with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) [(which NASA is planning on doing)](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/15/rocket-on-collision-course-with-the-moon-built-by-china-not-spacex) both before and after impact. Then we can compare the crater created with the kinetic energy estimate and see how well it matches up with the energy needed to create a crater of that size. This allows for estimates of the density and composition of the Moon's surface in that region. This is actually very exciting from a science perspective. In fact, there was a whole mission designed to impact the Moon that is similar. It was called LCROSS. [That mission was actually launched from the LRO.](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LCROSS/overview/index.html)",

The moon landing was the result of a lot of investment galvanized by a cold war space race.  These political conditions haven't been recreated, so there is less political appetite for huge budget space flight.  Now we are moving from government led development to private sector led, that has many implications.  As some have already commented, this opens up space flight access for 'regular joes', albeit insanely rich ones...but with time the technology can become more accessible for all. The idea is also to move toward using rockets for quick travel worldwide, shoot up to orbit and land on the other side of earth in 30 minutes.  That's one business model, the other side of SpaceX is Starship which will make interplanetary journeys to Mars and beyond.  That is mind-blowing to me.",

Personally if I had those funds I would go to space at the earliest opportunity, I can't think of anything more incredible!  It's more efficient for us to divide and conquer when it comes to the problems of the world, we don't need to all work on the same issues.

More money goes to companies building rockets / other space capable hardware, than if these companies had to rely on government contracts and or satellite  launches only.\n2. More money means faster growth.\n3. More money going into the space industry means these companies can be bigger and that there can be more of them. People see others making money with space tourism, they want to ape them.\n4. More and bigger companies means more opportunities are created for engineers, software people, architects, etc. to work on cutting edge stuff.\n5. The number of people with experience in space hardware, software, operations etc. increases as a result.\n6. Cutting edge engineering results in more than just cutting edge rockets. Off shoots and inspiration happens, new alloys are created, new manufacturing processes, etc. etc. all that can result in better / new products not related to space.\n7. There are more flights to (the edge) of space, this means more opportunity to develop better, more efficient engines and hardware.\n8. Going to space becomes cheaper. Due to better hardware, but probably more importantly thanks to economies of scale for parts and whatnot. And thanks to competition.\n9. Cheaper access to space makes other endeavors more viable. For example manufacturing in space. Manufacturing higher quality optical fibers for medical devices for example. 3D printing human tissues (livers, arteries, heart valves, etc) seems to be easier as well.\n10. To expand the space industry into more facets (beyond satellite operations, small scale experiments, government contracts etc,) you don't just need large amounts of money flowing in, but also large amounts of human resources. In this case the tourism industry seems like good training ground, as mentioned earlier.\n11. Billionaires will want to stay in space longer, making private space stations more viable.\n12. More people staying in space longer will create a (larger) market for developing medical technology that combats the negative effects of staying in space. Like loss of bone mass and muscle mass. Could lead to therapies being developed that could be used outside of tourism as well.\n13. There will also be a bigger market for specialized space hardware  to increase comfort in space. Which could be of benefit for space explorers as well. A better toilet experience might not be a priority on a government mission, professional astronauts are maybe expected to tolerate less than ideal conditions, as opposed to a space tourist. So comfort is low on the priority list for a government agency.\n\nAll this because more money goes into space related companies thanks to 10 minute \"space\" rides.",

Sure, it's talked about in the context of who gets to Mars first, but that's not the objective. So the question really should be: \n\n\u2022 should a capitalistic company be trying to ensure the survival of humanity by making it multi planetary as opposed to exploiting the resources in our solar system\n\nStrictly speaking, the answer is no. Capitalistic companies care about making money. However, Elon has found a way to make SpaceX one of the top valued private companies in America. He's done so while making it clear to investors to expect their ROI in decades, not months or years, and then used those investments to help fund development of a mega constellation that could rake in billions (in years) and a SHLV that, if successful, would corner the market (again, in years). The synergies that Musk has created between Tesla batteries being used on Falcon 9 rockets to Boring Company loops potentially being used to facilitate E2E travel, make you wonder if there could be a long term profit angle to going to Mars that coexists with the stated goal of a backup and making humanity multi planetary.\n\nI'm not sure if the conventional capitalistic model matters in SpaceX's case. \n\nPersonally, I think SpaceX will engage in things like asteroid mining, they just haven't talked about it. I also think Musk makes money as a way of doing what he dreams of doing, as opposed to making billions as an end goal like a conventional billionaire. If you asked him to be more like a Jeff Bezos, I think he'd actually be less successful, and make his investors less money.",

E.E. \"Doc\" Smith wrote the Lensmen series between 1948 and 1954 and he had a surprisingly insightful amount of detail in them about space travel.

Interacting with, learning from, using, and changing the universe is important for expanding as a species (not necessarily physical expansion). Let the universe be our toolkit. But that is something I often find I am the only person who holds that position.\n\nIsaac Arthur does a lot of futurism content, and a huge array of Fermi-Paradox solutions, and he seems pretty thorough as well as notes where his personal positions are so you can tell how his information my be biased. You might enjoy his stuff: https://youtube.com/channel/UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g\n\nPotential for something is usually a pretty weak stance. Mere existence results in a potential to prevent a species from arising on another planet. One photon reflects off your head away from a chain reaction that would have caused life to evolve on Mars.

It comes down to probability, your personal ethic, and weighing those together.\n\n.\n\nThere are two tracks I take on this question. The engineering track and the ethics track, but both play into eachother.\n\nThe engineering track is to weigh the cost and benefits. My main question for you here is \"what if we don't colonize Mars and life doesn't emerge?\"\n\nThe ethical track asks \"what makes something good?\" The best argument I've heard is that we make things good. Without people doggos are not good, they are just doggos, but if people are there to say they are good then they are. It varies as the human mind and human condition changes. The point here being that if we don't colonize and no life emerges, we are doing an ethical wrong to not go there and bring life or what ever things we see as good.\n\nOne last element in here, time. If life emerges, how long in the future? If it is quick, then ethical questions are easy. If it is long from now, what good could be produced from now until life emerges that would otherwise been lost? It is ethically ambiguous\n\nPut them together, you have 6 options.\n\n1. Colonize, life emerges soon. Ethical bad.\n\n2. Colonize, life emerges long from now. Ethically ambiguous\n\n3. Colonize, life doesn't emerge. Ethical good\n\n4. Don't Colonize, life emerges soon. Ethical good\n\n5. Don't Colonize, life emerges long from now. Ethically ambiguous\n\n6. Don't Colonize, life doesn't emerge. Ethically bad\n\n.\n\nOf course, I am oversimplifying this. It's not inherently ethically bad to prevent life from ever existing. Not saying kill life, but divert the path of time such that it doesn't exist. In a similar frame of thought, if it were bad for us to divert the path of the universe away from life, it would be equally bad if we don't actively divert the path of the universe to make life exist.\n\nIn a super dumbed down way of looking at it, what is the likelihood that life emerges on Mars if we don't colonize? From what we can tell as of yet, very low. If we do colonize Mars, then we are actively putting life there (and not just human life). All of the life we bring to Mars likely has a better chance of evolving to, in some fashion, be better suited to live on Mars than anything we've seen there yet. Simply, is it better to risk life never being on Mars for a chance that life may emerge?\n\nNow if we find life, that's a whole other question, probably for another time.\n\n.\n\nAs for the Fermi-Paradox, I can definitely see a different sent of circumstances, psychologies, and knowledge leading a civilization to not want to colonize outward, but not all of them, and not enough to make others not colonize.\n\nWell, I'm happy to chat more about this.

And not just by diminishing human flourishing, but also the flourishing and development of all the myriad species we would ultimately introduce through terraforming/colonization of these other planets. Humans, and all ancillary introduced species would then experience their own amount of speciation.\n\nThird: by not interacting with a planet with life we would also be denying the naturally occuring changes to that planet's life that develops in response to our involvement. Just as, by our being present, some development would not occur, so would by our not being there would some development not occur. Which is better or more moral is purely subjective.\n\nFourth: the moral implications of our altering a planet currently barren of life are extremely small. Yes, we'd change landscapes, but we do that wherever we are. As does literally every living thing. Unless you're going to argue that existence itself is immoral, I don't see your point. That's a route to a form of anti-natalism applied to all life. If we do so on the assumption that life would eventually occur there, on the scale of billions of years, we would still be denying the existence of life there in the intervening period.

This is a snippet of an early conversation between two of the earliest settlers in that book:\n\n>\"...There's as much land on Mars as on Earth, with a unique geology and chemistry. The land has to be thoroughly studied before we can start changing it.\"  \n>  \n>\"We'll change it just by landing.\"  \n>  \n>Russell brushed aside Ann's objections as if they were spiderwebs on his face. \"Deciding to go to Mars is like the first phrase of a sentence, and the whole sentence says\u2014\"  \n>  \n>\"*Veni, vidi, vici.*\"\n\nSo, even outside of the consideration of hindering the development of life, there are questions to engage with regarding the alteration of landscapes that have developed without human interaction for billions of years before we've spent the time thoroughly cataloging and understanding those landscapes (and how to do that is its own problem). [This New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/is-mars-ours) is a good discussion about what's posed in Red Mars, as well as the more human-focused questions about the uncritical use of colonization as a vision of interplanetary settlement. And [*Space Forces* by Fred Scharmen](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3889-space-forces) is a good book that looks at a history of how different people from different societies have approached what a future in space could or should look like.\n\nThere's also a ton of good discussion in Earth-based environmental ethics that might interest you, particularly regarding the value distinction between humans and their environment and cohabitants (or even whether anything has *any* value outside of what we make of it. David Robertson and Bruce Hull's paper [\"Which Nature? A Case Study of Whitetop Mountain\"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43323550?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=which%20nature&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dwhich%2Bnature%26so%3Drel&ab_segments=0%2FSYC-6168%2Fcontrol&refreqid=fastly-default%3Aea521e79e7d12dacc3d3c69e6e1ba809) is a good take on the different ways we think about the value of \"nature\" here on Earth).\n\nPersonally, I think there are totally responsible reasons and means for human settlement on other bodies. But there are definitely tradeoffs that need to be considered, including a form of what you've posed. But I don't think it's as cut-and-dry as what you're suggesting or what a lot of these other comments are suggesting!",

        "body": "I have had a lifelong fascination with space travel, exploration and science fiction my entire life. But, I've recently realized that colonizing any other potentially habitable planet/moon (Mars included) could be considered a \"crime against the universe\".\n\nHow are we to know that in billions of years, as the sun expands and pushes Mars and other planets more into the habitable-zone that life won't (again?) find traction and evolve to new species independent of life on Earth? What give us the right to terraform, build colonies or perform any other activity that could potentially disrupt the processes of extraterrestrial-evolution?\n\nI suppose we could make the argument then that we could inhabit \"lifeless\" celestial bodies, but even then, considering the vastness of space and time, how would we know for certain that our actions aren't preventing a new form of life from existence?\n\nFor example; imagine we find life thriving on Titan and it is clearly evolving in a process separate but similar to life on Earth. In that case, the scientific consensus would most likely be to leave the planet as a sanctuary and make every effort to carefully study, but not disturb the natural processes happening there. We know with 100% certainty that we would severely disrupt or destroy extraterrestrial life on Titan if we colonized it.\n\nIn the same scenario, since there is NOT a zero percent chance that life would/could also evolve on Mars, we would have to treat this planet in the same manner (preserving it as a sanctuary) since there is a possibility it could at one point harbor life processes.\n\nI also propose that this might be a scenario considered within the Fermi Paradox. Where extraterrestrial aliens do exist and could colonize the galaxy, but don't due to an ethical consensus reached by advanced civilizations.\n\nThis is a question that has been bothering me for a few days now. I posted this to [r/unpopularopinion](https://redd.it/rc1own), but the replies were not very thoughtful or inspired. I hoping that this sub is better equipped to help me answer this. Thank you!\n\n**EDIT: Based on all the downvotes I guess this is a space-fantasy sub, not a space-science sub. Or, did I break the rules or something?**",

Then we discovered that there were *hundreds* of other large objects floating around out past Neptune.  It's one of a whole \"class\" of things.  So where do you draw the line?  Are there [over 200 planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_possible_dwarf_planets)?  Are there [over 1200 planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trans-Neptunian_objects)?  Of course not.  So you have to come up with some other criteria... the criteria they chose groups Pluto with Eris, Sedna, Makemake, Haumea, etc, with which Pluto has much more in common than Earth, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, etc.\n\nThat's the thing about classification systems: they're somewhat arbitrary.  Current consensus is that Pluto is also from the same class of things as Triton, which is considered a moon of Neptune.  Why is it a moon?  Because it's orbiting a body other than the Sun.  So what is Charon, the thing in that picture next to Pluto?  Is it a moon?  It has been argued that it's also a dwarf planet.  Pluto and Charon orbit each other... the center of their orbit is in the space between them, and maybe they're two planets in a binary system?\n\nUltimately, there's just all kinds of objects floating around in space, affected by each others' gravity, radiation, etc.  How we classify them is a matter of convenience and descriptive efficacy.  It's easiest to say what Pluto is, right now, if you call it a dwarf planet.  Maybe someday in the near future we'll learn a lot about other planetary systems in our neighborhood, and we'll have to redefine things again when we see that our system differs from the norm in some way?",

The egg-heads at the Science and Technology Policy Institute say that 2037 launch is the soonest we could realistically go with all the money in the world because we've never designed a \"no-earth intervention life support system\" that lasts longer than the mission duration. And we've never recovered anything from martian orbit before. So 2050 with budget constraints, delays, and developing new technology and shakedown tests in space(likely to the moon).

              "body": "There are several reasons why human space travel is worth pursuing, despite the risks and challenges involved. First and foremost, human space exploration allows us to learn more about our own planet and the universe we live in. Through the use of advanced technology, including robotics, humans are able to conduct research and gather data that would be impossible to obtain through the use of probes alone. This data can help us better understand the origins of our planet and the universe, as well as the potential for life on other planets.\n\nAdditionally, human space travel enables us to push the boundaries of what is possible and inspire future generations to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The exploration of space has always been a source of fascination and wonder, and sending humans to the moon and beyond serves as a tangible representation of our desire to explore and learn more about the world around us.\n\nFurthermore, human space travel has practical applications here on Earth. For example, the technologies and materials developed for space exploration can often be repurposed for use in other industries, such as transportation, healthcare, and energy production. This can lead to significant economic and societal benefits, such as the creation of new jobs and the development of new technologies.\n\nFurthermore, human space travel has the potential to play a critical role in the future of humanity. As our planet continues to face challenges such as climate change and resource depletion, the ability to explore and potentially settle other planets could be crucial for the survival of our species. While this may seem like a far-fetched idea at the moment, the truth is that we simply don't know what the future holds. By investing in human space travel and exploration, we are laying the groundwork for potential future contingencies and ensuring that we have the capabilities and technologies necessary to adapt and thrive in an ever-changing world.\r  \n\r  \nAdditionally, human space travel can foster international cooperation and collaboration. The challenges of space exploration are too great for any one nation to tackle on its own, and as a result, many space missions are carried out through international partnerships. This can help to build bridges between nations and promote peaceful cooperation on a global scale.\r  \n\r  \nFurthermore, human space travel has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of the human body and its capabilities. The unique conditions of space, such as microgravity and radiation, can provide valuable insights into how the human body functions and adapts to extreme environments. This knowledge can then be used to develop new treatments and therapies for a range of medical conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are certainly risks and challenges associated with human space travel, the potential benefits far outweigh the costs. Human space exploration allows us to learn more about our planet and the universe we live in, inspire future generations to pursue careers in STEM fields, and drive technological and economic growth.",

Famine, war, genocide, all of it could have been avoided if there was more space to grow food, more resources that people had access to, more space for people to expand/run to when things got bad. There are eight billion of us now, and we're out of space and running out of resources. Human nature has never been able to be contained in a closed system, and now that Earth has been fully explored and mostly fully populated, it has become a truly closed system. If we're ever going to grow as a species, leaving Earth is the next and only step. This is all just my feelings on the matter, though, and not necessarily a hard reason\n2. The biggest actual *reason*, is because the Sun *will* die. It is about halfway through it's 8-10 billion year lifespan, and most estimates I've read (these numbers could be way off) say that we have another 1.5-2 billion years left before the sun has expanded so much Earth becomes a molten hellscape. At some point in the future, humanity must leave Earth or be wiped out entirely. It is a scientific certainty, and eventually, we must reckon with that fact. We have no way of knowing how long it will take for us to work our way to another star system, but if we don't, we will cease to exist. Even with all of our flaws, I'm rather fond of Humanity, and I would hate to see everything we've accomplished not even be remembered.

The only viable reason past bragging rights for us to go to space outside of our immediate orbit is for mining resources, how would we even return these resources to earth in a cost efficient manner? Weight is one of the biggest problems in space travel. The only resources I can think of that could be remotely worth it that humanity needs are conductive metals which we could find and transport much easier on earth. Gold is expensive but not that expensive. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s oil waiting for us out there on Neptune.\n\nMoon bases are pretty cool but for what? A staging point to go to Mars? Again, for what? Mars can\u2019t sustain an atmosphere, there are no resources we can\u2019t find on Earth and more importantly no significant magnetic field to fight off solar winds stripping away the very air that we breathe. So we would live inside bubbles to sustain the entirety of humanity? How would we generate oxygen? Through electrolysis? refining metals? (like aluminum assuming it\u2019s readily available on Mars) growing plants? And that\u2019s only Mars. It doesn\u2019t save us from the Sun.\n\nIf the goal is to get out before the Sun blows up we would be talking about Generation ships - it would take so long to get to any other part of the galaxy we would need ships that sustain humans through lifetimes just to reach a new planet, banking on nothing going wrong on this space ship dooming the inhabitants (which seems unlikely), no resupplies, and in the hope that we could even generate a settlement on a planet we\u2019ve only spied through telescopes with light years old information that would be technically so far in the past by the time that we get there that planet may be entirely uninhabitable. That\u2019s not even mentioning the issues with radiation exposure once we leave the heliosphere.\n\nUntil we figure out faster than light travel - if that\u2019s even a possibility - what\u2019s the point?\n\nEdit: Grammar",

We need to explore & reach new heights. In many cases it can be very risky and people will perish. But that\u2019s the price we pay for advancement. The toll that new knowledge brings to the table.\n\nNow, the more practical takes are three fold:\nDomination, resources and preservation. \n\nDomination: although there are currently treaties regulating claiming celestial objects for government or private use, you can easily see a scenario where the team with the most flags out there sort of calls the shots.\n\nResources: an overlooked reality is that EVERYTHING important to industry and society today will run out relatively soon. They are in limited supply on earth and not replenishing. There are space rocks out there with our planet\u2019s worth of mass in those materials out there. We have to start now before it\u2019s too late. I know the moon mission is critical to this, because it\u2019s close enough to the earth that resupplys can be done quickly but its low gravity ensures it\u2019s cheaper to launch stuff from there. So it\u2019s a good halfway point for future more serious missions.\n\nPreservation: mars falls into this category.\nEarth has seen it\u2019s fair share of extinction events. Some say statistically one is overdue. Life as we know it only lives on this rock. If we care about the future of humanity, we need to seek ways in which we are not all clumped into this one and only planet as a kind of backup. It\u2019s a more altruistic endeavor, as we likely won\u2019t benefit from it and it will consume lots of resources to achieve. But if we pull it off, it will also feed into the two other reasons.",

One thing I noticed was a sharp rise in market prices for items like flour and sugar, however Putin signed a law limiting the manipulation and forced inflation on those products, so now they've stabilized. Additionally the pandemic is pretty much over there, everyone in Europe is on lockdown but Russia has removed all lockdowns and even mask mandates. Saw entire night clubs open and large gatherings every since the death rates stagnated. Haven't heard of any mass cosmic corruption personally..",

BFR is already designed to be able to do Mars missions, so unless they decided to scale the entire thing back to just be capable of Moon missions they aren't really saving any effort. \n\nThe idea behind BFR is that, since they now have a stable position in the launch market with Falcon 9, their next vehicle is going to be the one that takes them to Mars, regardless of whether they immediately use it for that purpose or not. The BFR design is more than capable of doing Moon missions, every sort of Earth-orbit mission, even missions to Near-Earth Asteroids. Unlike the Apollo-Saturn or other proposed transport vehicles, the BFR is not locked into going to only one destination. \n\nOf course the plan was never to go to Mars on the first launch anyway. The aspirational goals for the first Mars missions given during the 2017 IAC were *not* the expected date of the first launches of BFR. It's likely that SpaceX will launch BFR dozens of times over several years before they ever send a BFS to Mars. Of course SpaceX will probably miss their first stated mission-to-Mars date, but they do plan on getting the BFR up and running as soon as possible, and are working very hard to do so. Those first many flights will be everything from commercial satellite deployments to highly elliptic returns stress testing the thermal protection system to simulated Mars EDL in the upper atmosphere of Earth. The BFR should be well proven as a vehicle before it ever tries to tackle a real Mars landing. ",

It's a good enough story that people are daring to feel optimistic about space again.",
