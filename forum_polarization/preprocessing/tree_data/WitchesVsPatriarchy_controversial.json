Truth is the secret weapon.\n\nALL Gods in history were judged by the truth, if they were found to be false, they lose their power. They are laughed into history like a silly dream told by a couple brothers and an invisible tablet. Even now, each religion itself, claims to hold the truth, and if they were to find out beyond a shadow of doubt they were given a lie, they either admit themselves to be self deceiving and untrustworthy, or they abandon the belief in search of Truth. \n\nSo in other words, we are all worshipping the same God. Already. We are all in the same religion already. We are all in alignment with reality and we have perfectly positioned ourselves based on what we need to learn, in relationship to the truth. \n\nTRUTH is the highest authority in the universe. This is not up for debate, it's the root word of all words, as words are themselves created by defining what something is, and is not. So to misrepresent the truth, is to destroy language itself. \n\nSo the Pope cannot be the manifestation of Truth on earth. Preachers cannot be seen to have a moral or spiritual high ground if they do not teach truth. Can they even define Truth?\nCan a man without a North on his compass lead me to the North? Anyone that doesn't know truth and the nature of truth, doesn't know God. They are literally one and the same. \n\nThe best thing we can ever do in our lives, is prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Richard Dawkins is the high priest of Christianity.\n\nI mean it's like we are literally fighting a giant straw man scarecrow that is as empty as it gets. \n\nTruth is the sword to cut it to shreds because we can return to a space where True is True and False is False. \n\nAnd the Truth is defined as, \"that which corresponds to reality\". It is the law of correspondence. If it does not correspond to reality, at all, it is not true. And there are differing levels of veracity, all the way from no evidence to an entire universe of evidence. What has more evidence is most trustworthy. Anyone genuinely seeking God will seek truth and veracity.\n\nThese words seem to strike fear in the heart of the faithful, to them it means the defeat of spirituality once and for all. And yet the truth is that there are things that correspond for short periods of times, and things that correspond for time spans we cant even comprehend. It is the fabric of an infinite ocean of meaning, rather than an empty void it is feared to be.",

Socrates said that the unexamined life is not worth living. I grew to enjoy exploring and evolving. Then the pandemic hit and I had nothing but time to think and examine. I still research, listen to people's stories, explore my senses, and stretch my limits. I find that when I'm guided by the still small voice inside me (some people call it by a deity's name, I believe it's my wise mind or soul) it usually steers me in the right direction.\n\nI almost forgot that I also couldn't do that without my chosen tribe. I have a small handful of dear friends who keep me grounded, focused, and centered. When I can't see toxic boundary crossing happening to me because of NRE...they call it to my attention. When I become overly self-critical or take on too much, they reel me in. I do the same for them as well. My BFF is closer to me than any intimate partner I have. We keep each other sane and safe.",

And even if I were to imagine living separately for whatever reasons, I think I'd at least discuss it to gage his comfort level (as I would appreciate that courtesy as well). Ultimately, I wouldn't have a male sleeping in my household without my husband around unless they were in trouble (like so they don't drive drunk) or family because I just wouldn't want to put myself in a situation where trust is questioned.\n\nIn my old age, I don't believe in just giving people \"trust\" anymore, trust is verified and earned.

This is an attack on health care just as much as it is on bodily autonomy. \n\nUltimately a removal of womens rights is putting at risk minority rights. Ive seen arguments that are similar to the language around Black Lives Matter and the people who said all lives matter but in the same breath,  like you've said, those who do not identify as woman can and are affected by this which can make it more complicated than the BLM. Which I think ultimately when you break it down like that, means this qualifies to justify its a womans issues, a trans issue, and ultimately a human rights issue. I don't think talking about womens rights is inherently meant to be exclusive but I understand where you are coming from most definitely. \n\nI think there are two big difficult points to tackle here.\n\n One major one is to have a clear message. Again, I'll go back to the Black Lives Matter. Some of the same issues the black community faces, other POC face. Yet rallying behind one focused point is worth its own weight has a clear message and those same group DO support other minorities. It doesn't make any other peoples struggles less relevant. So to be clear. You. Are. Relevant. You are most definitely welcome and needed and your concerns are valid. I don't want to dimish that by any means. When it comes to clear public messages, it is ultimately simpiler to talk about it being a womens rights issue. That being said, you should absolutely speak out speak your mind, put it on your protest boards, post it to your socials. Please be vocal. And others should stand up and do the same. \n\nThe other point is that I have found our social complexities don't quite match our language abilities. Its obvious even when talking about the different types of people affected by this, along with other issues Ive seen. For example useing AFAB or AMAB is not always accurate or apportionment language to use for trans folk, but for Non-bianary people it is in some cases needed so Ive noticed some conflict and confusion about the use of the termsin general. And I'll point out the \"uterus havers\" is absolutely not accurate to use either. Women in general talks about a broad spectrum of people who may or may not have a uterus, can carry a child, or have completely different anatomy. And the people that description misses (because ultimately woman is an identity not a marker of genitals or genetics) are people like yourself and Non-bianary folk. For so long we have, in mass, as a society regarded gender and sex to be the same thing and its going to take some time for the actual language to catch up and it's clear to me when these issues come up just how difficult it is to use accurate and inclusive terms. \n\nMy suggestion would be to talk about this as a womans issue and a trans issue and always always always come back to the idea that it is a human rights issue. If you have other suggestions on language to use, it is also most welcome. I personally try to say people, instead of women, but ultimately if I say women its accurate and on message and it's not meant to make others affected by this invisible. Please speak up and talk about how this affects the trans community and trans peoples health care. It's important.",

The message I\u2019ve gotten is they like us when they can use us.\n\nI don\u2019t really feel like people take my health care needs seriously, or my frustrations and anxieties, literally no one in my life (besides my therapist) has acknowledged how scared or angry I feel. I feel like I\u2019m lumped in with women even though I\u2019ve lived my entire adult life as a man and have taken every means necessary to distance myself from womanhood that I can economically afford and which I\u2019m emotionally comfortable with, that I\u2019m reduced to having a uterus (\u201cuterus haver\u201d) or reduced to my birth sex (\u201cAFAB\u201d), I feel the misandry in comments like \u201cI hate men\u201d (I honestly avoided this community for a long time because of the hostility I saw against men. It just didn\u2019t seem like a welcoming place for me to be), and I feel the transphobia when people say that I don\u2019t count in their statement about hating men. Sometimes it seems like everyone wants to contribute their reason for me to hate myself. And it takes a lot of strength and resilience to keep your head high and not succumb.\n\nSooo, I don\u2019t have anything all that uplifting to add. I hear you. The trans life is not an easy one, I\u2019ve lived it for 18 years through various phases in my life and the different physical forms I was in, through political changes, and changing social acceptance and visibility. It\u2019s hard as hell. Take your time to be angry, to be sad, to feel unheard, unseen, unwanted, but never stop fighting the good fight. And never let anyone convince you, through perhaps their own blindness, to hate yourself. I know this is a witchy community and we\u2019re not here for Jesus, but sometimes, I honestly just hang on tight to: \u201cForgive them, they didn\u2019t know\u201d to give myself the peace I deserve.",

They are homophobes and trans phones and right wing fundamentalists, but they still don\u2019t like the thought of a woman being unable to get treatment if he pregnancy is killing her.\n\nThese people are not my allies, but in this we can get along. And tbh, I am afraid of anything that could distract those people from voting for reproductive rights.  I\u2019ll ride the coattails of people who have a louder voice than me because when push comes to shove I just want it to work out in my favor.\n\nAnd the fact that trans children are being denied care is TERRIFYING. It\u2019s abhorrent.  But rights for women tend to cast a broader net than just women.  As a weak example the relatively new protection employees have against gender discrimination in the workplace allows men to wear dresses.  Or makes it easier for trans women to transition in the open.\n\nTrump and his cronies sent us back 50 damn years.  So consequently the trans rights movement got sent back with it.  But women\u2019s rights is something that a majority of people can get behind without having to even think.  They can ignorantly and blindly go to the polls and cast their ballots.  But if some of those wankers out there who are pro women\u2019s rights get a whiff that it *might* help a trans person or a non-binary person they could start to think that they were thinking and vote against reproductive rights just to stick it to the trans people or whatever.\n\nYou are not wrong in your pain and frustration.  I read people\u2019s experiences and I weep.  Regularly.  But, imo, this is now a war.  And the most critical front at the moment is reproductive rights because it is not just a fight for the right to choose, it is the literal fight for women to be recognized as people. Of course trans people should be recognized as people as well, but the largest group right now that is marginalized, that the largest amount of people will get behind, are those that fall under the umbrella term \u201cwoman\u201d.  So if it has to be couched as \u201cwomen\u2019s rights\u201d to keep everyone fighting the same fight and for the right team.  \n\nIdiots and assholes are allowed to vote.  The Republican Party grabbed them and twisted any good out of them that might have once been there.  Now, those of us that want rights, are trying to grab them and twist them back to voting in a sane way.\n\nAs for the dysphoria, I completely understand where you are coming from.  As AFAB it makes sense that I would shout for \u201cwomen\u2019s rights\u201d. And of course, like you, I do care about women\u2019s rights.  It\u2019s just weird for me to act like I feel like that impacts me.  And yet\u2026 it *does* impact me. And that\u2019s weird.  But, to keep things simple, for simple people, I shout for women\u2019s rights.  And I shout for trans rights separately because some of these people just can\u2019t see that everyone deserves rights.  \n\nI hope what I wrote makes sense.  After so much typing on a mobile device where I can\u2019t easily read everything I typed to make sure it sounds ok, I\u2019m not sure it sounds ok.\n\nI guess my point is that it helps to keep it simple for people who need it to be simple, because overcomplicating it could cause them to turn against the right of choice.  There are so many things wrong right now and I think that battles need to be picked carefully so we might gain footing.",

                                "body": "i was flipping around what you said so that hopefully you could understand how you were erasing trans masc and AFAB non-binary people in a conversation that was literally asking you to please stop erasing trans masc and AFAB non-binary people. that was the context. it's like how historically, humanity used to be called 'mankind' and how the 'neutral'/'default' pronoun for people was he, as in 'each to **his** own', whereas we'd now say 'each to **their** own'. it erased women just as you trying to squash trans mascs and AFAB non-binary people in under \"women\" erases us.\n\nmaybe you should have a think about how you don't understand basic terms being used in this thread and still felt the need to contribute your transphobic opinion, and then request significant emotional labour of a trans person. you could have learnt appropriate terms by googling this or looking at any of the trans subreddits.\n\nsince we're here and i doubt you're the only person who's confused and/or thinks trans masc and AFAB non-binary people should be included under \"women\" because your comment got upvoted a shocking number of times, let's start with the basics anyway:\n\ntransgender/trans - a person whose gender is different to the gender they were assigned at birth\n\ncisgender/cis - a person whose gender is the same as the gender they were assigned at birth\n\ntrans and gender diverse/TGD - an inclusive term for the non-cis community, representing both those who do and do not identify as trans but are not cis (see: 'non-binary')\n\nAGAB - assigned gender at birth, as in, \"my AGAB was female\"\n\nAFAB - assigned female at birth. a baby who is assumed to be female gender when they are born, often (but not always) because their external sex characteristics include a vagina\n\nAMAB - assigned male at birth. a baby who is assumed to be male gender when they are born, often (but not always) because their external sex characteristics include a penis\n\ntrans man - a person whose gender is male, and usually is assigned female at birth (AFAB)\n\ntrans woman - a person whose gender is female, and usually is assigned male at birth (AMAB)\n\ntrans masc/masculine - a more inclusive term for trans people whose gender is aligned with masculinity in some way, including trans men. this term includes some non-binary genders for AFAB people\n\ntrans femme/feminine - a more inclusive term for trans people whose gender is aligned with femininity in some way, including trans women. this term includes some non-binary genders for AMAB people\n\nnon-binary - a gender that exists outside the traditional male-female gender binary (hence, non-binary). non-binary can be a gender by itself, or a category for another gender. while non-binary genders technically come under the 'transgender' label, people who are non-binary may or may not identify as trans (see: 'trans and gender diverse/TGD')\n\nbinary - either cis man, trans man, cis woman or trans woman; a binary gender that exists within the traditional male-female gender binary\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso, having defined all of these terms, why is it wrong and transphobic to say that trans masc and AFAB non-binary people are all under the category of \"woman\" and that it's just a convenient moniker for them? simply put, because none of these people *are* women. if they were women, they would identify as women. calling them women and insisting that the term \"woman\" is sufficient to refer to them not only erases their existence as people (which is inherently transphobic), it also invalidates their gender (which is also inherently transphobic) - 'we all know \"women\" refers to some men anyway, right?' (because they're not *really* men when it counts.)\n\nit also ignores the specific reproductive healthcare needs trans and gender diverse (TGD) AFAB people may have that cisgender women do not. for instance, a TGD AFAB person may want to stop their periods to treat gender dysphoria. this is not a need cis women have, because cis women do not have gender dysphoria. the methods used to stop periods will potentially be different, as the go-to method for many cis women (take the pill) has significant feminising effects which is obviously inappropriate for many people who aren't women. (\"feminising effects\" means 'makes look feminine', in terms of body fat distribution, muscle mass, eyebrow arch, etc.) additionally, if a TGD AFAB person experiences an unwanted pregnancy, including as the result of a rape, they will likely need specialised mental health support due to the added factors of potential gender dysphoria, transphobia (e.g., medical staff may treat them badly if they are a TGD person seeking an abortion, refuse to provide them care, discriminate against them, forcibly out them or even try to hurt them) and if they were raped, the rape having been a hate crime against them as they are TGD. (yes, trans masc and AFAB non-binary people are frequently the victims of violent and sexual assaults and rape for being TGD.) none of these things apply to cis women seeking an abortion for an unwanted pregnancy. that's not to say that cis women aren't subject to discrimination or need mental health support if they experience an unwanted pregnancy, it's to say that cis women do not have exactly the same needs in this area as TGD people specifically because cis women are not TGD. additionally, what if services are gendered which prevents TGD people from accessing them? in my country (australia) until 2013, the way the government organised medical codes for procedures meant that some procedures had a gender attached to them - e.g., code 12345 \"for the provision of abortion before 20 weeks to a woman of child-bearing age\". (i'm making up the specific code and the specific description, but you get what i mean.) this meant that technically, TGD people could not access abortion unless they were women - which, fundamentally, AFAB TGD are not. what about providing a pap smear? or providing a hysterectomy - including for cases that were not to treat gender dysphoria, but diseases like endometriosis? obviously, putting TGD AFAB people under the same label as \"women\" in these cases has really severe consequences.\n\nthe label is also inaccurate for almost all trans women - trans women generally don't have uteruses and don't need the same kinds of reproductive healthcare that AFAB people (cis women, trans mascs and AFAB non-binary people - i.e., people most likely to have uteruses) do. i have heard from many trans women that it makes them extremely dysphoric for them to be included in something (because they're women, and it's a \"women's rights\" issue) that they can't physically do, no matter how much they may want to. on top of that, many cis women are infertile and/or have had their uteruses (and/or other reproductive organs) removed for various reasons. reproductive rights aren't as relevant to these people anymore. some AFAB people (regardless of gender) are going to be pregnant at whatever time we discuss this, which means reproductive rights are less relevant for them now and then will be more relevant later.\n\nso \"woman\" as a general term is supposed to cover all of these people:\n\n* cis women who can get pregnant\n* cis women who cannot get pregnant (for whatever reason)\n* trans women, who generally cannot get pregnant\n* trans mascs, who are not women but can generally get pregnant\n* non-binary AFAB people, who are not women but can generally get pregnant\n\nfor reproductive rights, it seems like the unifying factor here isn't whether someone is a woman - the unifying factor and the real issue is whether or not someone can get pregnant. we're still working out what the term here should be - the preferred term i've seen is \"people who can get pregnant\". i've also seen \"people with uteruses\" (often shortened to \"uterus-havers\"), which i don't like so much personally. (a fun alternative i saw was \"uterus-bearers\" \\[and \"penis-bearers\" for those with penises\\] which i think is much less dehumanising). feel free to come up with your own language, but maybe next time think about why you feel it's necessary to erase TGD people from a conversation that's literally asking you to not do that exact thing.",

We can acknowledge that attacks on abortion rights are part of conservatives\u2019 hugely misogynistic desire to control and oppress women, while also acknowledging that not all of the people they see as women are actually women in reality.\n\nMany Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists (who have an incredibly narrow, misogynistic view of womanhood) seek to forcibly define a woman as anyone with a uterus, using the guise of abortion activism as a way to spew transphobia. They are doing so to exclude trans people from the conversation on purpose. Many real feminists use \u201cwoman\u201d because that\u2019s what they\u2019re accustomed to, and I don\u2019t blame them at all for that. I understand it can be hard to change language. I honestly have no problem with calling abortion a women\u2019s issue in casual conversation. But every time an activist advocates for abortion as if it\u2019s a woman-only issue, they are, intentionally or not, marginalizing trans people. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to spread awareness of more inclusive language.",

However, I'd like to clarify that the point of terms like \"menstruator\" and \"womb haver\" is to separate the concept of \"womanhood\" from having certain organs, because not all people who have those organs are women, and not all women have those organs. It's the opposite of trying to reduce women down to their body parts.\n\nI think many people get upset at the idea of those terms being used as a replacement term for \"women\", which would be understandable, but that's completely not the case. \"Womb haver\" is not used to mean \"woman\". It's used to mean \"any person who has a womb, regardless of gender identity, and thus experiences the issues that tend to come with having a womb\". This includes many, but not all, trans men, nonbinary people, and cis women.\n\nYou mention that you had to earn your womanhood regardless of having been born with a uterus. That, and your story in general, seems to have parallels with many experiences of trans women I've read. Many, many people, cis or trans, have bodies that do not align precisely with what society expects of their gender. And this is why it's important to separate the concept of womanhood from the concept of having a womb. This is why \"woman\" is not an accurate term to use when discussing abortion rights and the people affected by it.",

The idea that only people who can get pregnant would want to support abortion access is obviously absurd but, within the patriarchy (as well as capitalism and white supremacy), it's held up as normal to not care about someone's rights being taken away so long as your rights are secure.  \nIn fact there are also those who rights aren't secure and think that no other marginalised group can even begin to question their place in the world so long as that remains the case. I once spoke about being non binary and about confusing sexuality and was told that \"as long as black lesbians are getting murdered on the street your issues don't matter.\"\n\nSo it's \"I got mine so who cares about you,\" or \"I don't got mine yet so who cares about you.\"\n\nThe dismissal or ignorance, willful or otherwise, of people who can get pregnant not always being women is part of the bigger whole, part of the control desired by the systems we try to rally against.

I live in a typical suburb in a blue state, and still the only trans person I\u2019ve ever met in person (to my knowledge) is my friend\u2019s wife, who is a trans female. I hate to admit it, but whenever discussing these laws, I only ever really considered cis women because that\u2019s all that I\u2019ve been exposed to. Because of my lack of exposure, I\u2019m trying really hard to be inclusive, but because I have a very limited scope, it\u2019s hard. We\u2019re brainwashed from an early age that gender and gender roles matter, and I will admit that it\u2019s just really hard to unlearn this. But I\u2019m trying!!",

If that's all you are at any given time then yes, it is. But in the context of legislating what people can and can't do with their uterus, it's incredibly relevant to put it in those terms. Just saying \"women\" is not useful as many women don't have a uterus or otherwise cannot get pregnant for any reason. Likewise, as we've all been saying, lots of people are not women and do have a uterus.\n\nAnyway, I'm really glad people are still talking about this!

        "body": "The support for pro-choice and women's liberation here is wonderful, but as a transmasc nonbinary person with a uterus I can't help but feel completely disincluded from the whole movement. I'd sacrifice my life for women's rights, but when people act like the rights to contraception, birth control, abortions, and general bodily autonomy are ONLY for women, it just makes me feel so dysphoric and terrible. And I get the point, most people in the world with a uterus are cisgendered women, and it's much easier to say \"women\" instead of \"uterus havers\" or whatever (I also wouldn't doubt that a lot of people who support pro-choice are TERFS, but at the same time that's just how the world is and doesn't make it bad at all. It's just an unfortunate truth). But I'm yet to see ANYTHING, ANY sort of support program, statement, or even simply a sign that doesn't say \"we support WOMEN\" implying that a woman is defined by a uterus. Because trans women are women too, and quite a few of them have penises and not uteruses. I know the point is to take power away from the man, but transmascs are under the same constraints when it comes for forced birth (not to mention the hate rapes that we tend to get unfortunately). \n\nI'm just frustrated. Trans men and nonbinary people can get pregnant too, but there doesn't seem to be any support for us that isn't considered women's support. Anti-choice isn't only a problem for women. But trans people are almost ALWAYS an afterthought in most cis people's minds, people tend to forget we even exist. And I know I'll have people get angry at me for \"downplaying women's rights\", but I want to make it clear that I fully support women's rights and have gone to many protests and donated as much as I can afford for the women's rights to choose (since unfortunately I can't vote yet). But it fucking sucks being labeled as a woman just for having a uterus. I'm sick of not being heard, I'm sick of not being helped, and I'm sick of that fact never being acknowledged. I'm sick of being seen as a woman for having the option to get pregnant even though I'll never utilize it. I'm sick of seeing my trans sisters get put down for not having a uterus and being told they \"don't deserve the support of women since they don't have their problems\" ignoring the fact that trans people are MURDERED, HARASSED, AND BULLIED INTO SUICIDE CONSTANTLY. Trans women especially are demonized as perverts and pedos when they just want to live their lives in the gender that's right for them, and it disgusts me that people deny support for them on the basis of having a penis. Many southern states in the U.S. want to make it fucking illegal to support trans kids, but I haven't seen anyone outside trans spaces talk about it. It makes me feel so alone. I feel like I'll never be truly accepted and always seen as some sort of freak or poser or \"woman in denial\" or \"woman who's only trans because they want to benefit from the patriarchy\" or something. If I wanted to benefit from the system I wouldn't be fucking trans.\n\nI understand that this probably isn't gonna change, and I understand the importance of women's rights and giving the rights to women instead of men. But maybe some other trans people on this sub will share the same thoughts I do, I dunno. Everything just feels sucky and I want out of this hellhole country, but it feels like there's nowhere to go. I just wish I was cis and straight and could exist without others hating me and hating myself.\n\nedit: for everyone in the comments, i just want to clarify. im transmasc NONBINARY, currently in a bit of a gender crisis between agender and genderfluid (so i just use they/them pronouns and get on with it), but at the end of the day im not a man or a woman. i just feel more comfortable presenting myself in a more masculine way to the wide public. im also pre-T, pre surgery, pre basically any transition other than social, and i really don't \"pass\" all that well. so for all intents and purposes society has treated me basically like a woman all my life. just wanted to give some context on the people who would ever think im \"basically a man\" because im not :p\n\nalso, thank you for the love everyone!! even if i don't reply i do read your comments, even they all mean so much to me. im glad i can have a community where i can safely say these things, y'all are wonderful \ud83d\udc9c\u2728",

When I accepted and quit fearing death, suicidal ideation became an extreme rarity. When I became the vulnerability of this thing I've written, I was no longer compelled to remove it. Now, how to apply this more broadly? I guess, in time, I'll figure it out. Or not. Either way, where I am is perfect. Right now.\u00a0That's the overshadowing truth in all of this. This moment, right now, is complete. There's no lack and nothing to fear. Truth with a capital \"T\"... Now, to just be this Truth throughout my being... I cannot imagine anything more exquisitely beautiful... Life is amazing... Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I am deeply touched. \nHarpteethtooter",

Deeply. \n I've not allowed myself to read much poetry because I thought my understanding of it was contrived. Like, I was pretending. Here's the thing...\nPoets, artists, musicians... I've always held in very high esteem. I related with them. Because of my shame complex, \"my people\" have always been beyond my reach, as I don't \"deserve\" that identity. So, has this been my \"waiting?\" It's certainly been darkness, at times. \n  I was in the deepest darkest pit imaginable. Fetid fluids at my feet. Surrounded by cold, hard, slick stone. I could look up into the darkness and see a pinprick of light far above me. For decades, I struggled to climb from the pit. To ascend to that distant light. One day, when I had met myself for the first time, I reached up into the darkness and plucked that pinprick of light from the air. It wasn't distant. It was right there, all along, within my reach. I just had to reach up and claim it. \n  The pit is a womb. There, I owned the darkness. Was the darkness. Now, I'm in transition, still waiting, and slowly being illuminated, from within. The mirror that is my soul will always reflect myself completely, regardless of when I am. It illuminates truth, and cools that sometimes burning truth with shadow. The darkness taught me more than the light, alone, ever could.  The waiting was the doing, after all. Now, to be humility and embrace myself simultaneously? This confounds me...",

I've tried submitting stuff here before, but have always deleted it not long after. This time, I'm gonna go for it... and leave it...\n\nDamnit.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 I've a profound shame complex, and I'm a guy, so you might recognize why it's difficult for me to post stuff here.\u00a0 Like, all of womanhoods struggles are my fault? Silly shame. Tricks are for kids.(those tricks still often work on me, however, as I'll touch on shortly)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 The veil of adulthood only just obscures the true nature of my being. In this, I am blessed. For many, this obscurity is a wall.\u00a0 For me, it is a misty path leading me\u00a0to embracing my ultimate freedom. I've had so many childlike and willfully blind and stumbling steps, some more clear, sometimes, even guided steps. And, I've found a peace. I can have unsolicited gratitude. Sometimes, I wake with it. And, I know there's more.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 I've long been an ally of the women around me. Even when\u00a0 I couldn't perceive my own contribution to the patriarchy, I still saw, somehow,\u00a0 something wasn't right and behaved accordingly, when I could.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 The internet terrifies and fascinates me. There are no living, breathing, moving faces. No eyes. No bodies. No smells, textures, subtle hints...it's all absent... It's unsettling and difficult for me to navigate.\u00a0 Consequently, I barely know what I'm doing here. Which is, in reality, a good thing. I think. My vulnerability is most available when I feel challenged. Challenge is good.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 I'm a 50 year old man,... on the outside...\u00a0 and a proud father of 3 amazing young adults. I've had many different jobs, and many different interests, so, have many different skills. I was a stay at home dad for some 8 years.\u00a0 I'm a bit gaunt. (had covid this month. Lost weight I didn't have.) I live in a beautiful little rented home in a small city with two dear friends, both of whom are living with profound mental and physical health challenges. Birds of a feather, and all that. It is often a house of sadness and pain. I'm currently experiencing extreme compassion fatigue. Not gonna lie. It's hard. I'm the furthest along in mental health recovery. I am an anchor, here, because, well, turns out, I've become pretty good at it. I'm a person who delights in cultivating harmony. Painting. Sculpting.\u00a0 Cultivating gardens...the entire backyard is one!\u00a0 Baking bread is a passion.\n\n(I've got a 4 year old starter in the fridge! Her name is Fred. My daughter named her. \"Fetus bread\" = Fred...lol)\n\n\u00a0 I live for\u00a0 making nourishing and love filled food for myself, family and friends. I delight in helping people meet their needs. I'm a giver of care. A guardian of dignity. A watchdog for safety. I am extremely open to new experiences, and have already lived a whole lifetime because of my whimsical choices. I have rage, too. It terrifies me. I'm capable of terrible things. I can rend life. These, alongside shame, are some dominant facets of my character.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 I play harmonica that friends tell me fosters healing. (I play harmonica, but really, I want to sing.) I \"hear\" melodies near constantly. If I don't try too hard, or if I'm not too scared, I can play what I'm hearing. I'm a great actor. Not because I'm good\u00a0 at pretending, but,\u00a0 because I'm good at remembering.\u00a0\n\nI'm arrogant. I take control everywhere I can in my personal life: A learned mechanism for an illusion of security. I can, at times, be hard to live with. I sometimes drink too much.\n\nIn many, many ways, I'm naive. It is a facet of my whimsical nature. My naivete is a hidden strength ripe for harvesting. Always has been.\u00a0\n\nOnce a narcissist, now, I'm egocentric.\u00a0 I'm exceptionally gifted, and exceptionally talented. I've been blessed beyond measure. For my entire life, friends and family have told me, \"No one thinks like you...\"\n\nI'm piercingly honest...\n\n\u00a0 What do I See,\u00a0 though? What do I See when I look in the mirror?\n\n\u00a0I see a little boy from the 1970's.\n\n\u00a0 He's phenomenally gorgeous! All innocence and wonder! Big trusting eyes filled with awe. He's absolutely overflowing with an absolutely insatiable curiosity. He wants to live big. Learn everything. Feel everything. Ask everything... He has so many questions...\u00a0\n\nHe is,\u00a0 at once, Superman and Wonder Woman. He dreams of being a knight in distress who is rescued from a dragon by a fierce damsel. (He is the damsel, too. And the dragon. Sometimes, they have tea. Lol)\u00a0 At times the child is 4 or 5 years old. Sometimes he's 10, or 14, or even , maybe 18. But, usually, he's around about 7. He's 4 or 5 right now,\u00a0 though.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 What does this mean? Exactly what it says. I never really grew up. Really. I got stuck in time(s). The weirdest thing? The most amazing and beautiful and magical thing?\u00a0\n\nNow, I wouldn't have it any other way.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 I suffered through some 45 years of depression and mania. Mostly depression. I've survived 3 overt suicide attempts. At 17, 34, and 45. In 2015, I began doing inner child work under the guidance of an exceptionally gifted therapist. In September of 2019, an amazing Witchy friend led me to my center. She enabled me to meet myself, for the first time, using guided mirroring techniques.\u00a0 And, let me tell you,... Woah! And WOE!! And WOW!!!\n\n\u00a0 I could, literally, write volumes. However, those 3 words, written as they are,\u00a0 sum it up quite nicely.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Woah! WOE!! WOW!!!\n\nThat was quite an experience.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 Why am I drawn to you, Marvelous Witches, here?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 Because, well, quite frankly, I'm magic, too. And I feel alone in this.\u00a0 I've yet to find a \"spot.\" One where I can be vulnerable without the risk of being attacked for it. I seek discernment. I seek knowledge. I have no time, nor patience, for vitriol. I do that enough to myself. I,\u00a0recently, nearly removed all of my online presence because of one instance of this directed at me by another person. Just one.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 I'm a child. An extra sensitive one. One with growing wisdom. Growing discernment. Growing knowledge.\u00a0 And, growing power.(feels weird to write that...\"power\"...it's going to be very difficult to leave it...)\u00a0 A child with power? Hmmm.\u00a0 Caution... Right? Yes. However,\u00a0 this is a child who, at end of the day, no matter how hard I try, how much I learn, is never good enough. At anything. Truly fascinating. Right?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 I have the great fortune of having a life long friend. A friend since high school. We get together every 6 weeks or so and drink, smoke pot, take shrooms(well, sometimes shrooms), and pretend to be kids. He is a stabilizing force in my life. We share everything. I love him dearly. He is an exceptionally gifted ally.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0I have another\u00a0 treasured friend who is also my spiritual guide/companion. His wisdom is profound. I love him deeply. We've learned much from one another in very little time. He is also an exceptionally gifted ally.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 The mother of my youngest daughter is a Witch, herself. She and I are very close friends and often work closely together as coparents and as spiritual companions (that's an amazing tale, too! At one time, we were mortal enemies) Yet another exceptionally gifted ally. My life has had them present in abundance.\n\n\u00a0 But,(damn those buts),that is only 3 people outside of my home, and, independent of one another. I need community. I want other's feedback. In a group. Discussion. I want more teachers/students.\u00a0\n\n(I think all of us are both, at all times. The world is a grade school playground, and the chaperone went for coffee.\u00a0 Looong ago. On purpose. This is Real school. The chaperone is still present. Just not standing in the middle of the playground... sorta...)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0...Oof... This is getting long...\n\n\u00a0 This past summer, my wonderful son and his amazing girlfriend moved out of our home and struck out on their own. I took their room.\u00a0 \u00a0 For the first time, as an adult, I have my own, private, indoor space. I had no idea what it would become...\n\n\u00a0 Since, I have transformed it into my temple with an altar to myself and to Samn. (More on Samn in a bit)\n\n\u00a0 Anyway, I so want to share my little temple with people. It's peaceful here. And there's divine presence all around. The room is filled with living energy, both shadow and light. Balance. There's harmony here, and there's discord.\u00a0 I couldn't possibly be more surprised, delighted and grateful. Like, I did this? Yes. Yes, I did.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 I had a very powerful experience, some nights ago, here in this room. I decided to go out on a limb and go deep and try to \"talk to God\", inside me,...\u00a0 once again...\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u00a0 I said, \"Hey...ummm... Hi?\"\u00a0\n\n\nSomeone immediately said, \"Hello.\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4b.\"\n\n\n....uuuhhhh...\u00a0\n\nWait... what?!\n\n\u00a0\nKaBOOOOM\ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd28\ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude27\ud83d\ude26\ud83d\ude36\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude32\ud83e\udd70\n\n\n\u00a0It IS that easy? I...I...\n\nWoah! WOE!! WOW!!!\n\n\n\u00a0 Following my realization that Someone had been there all along, (like, right fucking there), I asked about something that really troubles me. That is, the word, \"God.\"\n\nI'll not go into depth about why, here.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnyway, I've been thinking,\u00a0 for a long time, about what an appropriate name for God might be, for me,\u00a0 that doesn't elicit immediate distaste in my perception. I came up with...\n\n\"Samn\".\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 Nongender specific, and the \"n\" removes \"white jesus\" from the equation in my brain. Samn is a powerful name. It elicits in me a sense of awe, respect, camaraderie, trust, security, raw power, love, tenderness, wisdom, fury, foolishness and fun... it's a good name...\n\n\u00a0 I asked Samn if it would be ok if I referred to Samn as Samn. Samn responded that Samn was, of course, fine with it. And, Samn was very amused,... and,.. a little touched,... I perceived...\n\n\u00a0 So, following this exchange, which happened in a very short span of time, I began trying to focus more intently on Samn. I was reeling a bit. Surprise, wonder,... abundant skepticism... My thoughts wandered, as they do, and suddenly, completely out of the blue, my subconcious asked Samn if Samn eats puppies.\n\n...wtf...?...\u00a0\n\nwait,... what?!...\n\n\u00a0 I mean, I've got Samn on the line, after all this time, and this is what I ask? Are you kidding me? Oh my goodness!\n\n\u00a0 There was much giggling, then Samn responded that, Yes, Samn does, in fact, eat puppies...\n\n\u00a0The absurdity of the exchange led to us giggling myself to sleep...?\n\n...I can't even...I mean,... I just...\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\n\n...WOW!!!...\u00a0\n\n...There's a 'welling up' inside of me, at times. A growing tsunami, at times. It ebbs and flows. I'm pretty good with words. However, there are no words, that I know of, that will accurately describe this sensation. This,...\u00a0 experience.\u00a0 Well, none,\u00a0 but one. One word.\u00a0\n\n.......Samn......\n\n\u00a0 Upon further reflection and introspection, I've had some thoughts about this. I'm having a hard time reconciling that my inner dialogue voice, (not the subconcious misappropriated identity, depressed one, but, the other one. The voice of reason one), is and has always been Samn's voice, as much as it's my own.\u00a0 My brain is all over the place with the implications of this. How to unpack these paradoxes and nuanced things I cannot yet perceive that I know are there, in the mist?hmmm... I perceive yet another key is within my grasp... likely soon...\n\nOkay... whatever...\n\nMoving on...\n\n\u00a0 Samn is presenting Samn's Self as 'Fun.' There's this sort of playful mischief and childlike delight. It's all smiling emojis and eternal, divine giggles, and... patience... and sweet berries...\u00a0\n\n...What the hell...\u00bf\n\n\u00a0 This is not an ominous old man on a throne of blinding light threatening me with a bad time. This is more like a mischievous Sprite, or a Fairy, flitting in and out of the shadows, trying to grab my attention,\u00a0 and, She just wants to play with me.\u00a0\n\n...What the hell...\u00bf\n\n\u00a0 Having spent all those years being immersed in the life-abrading misery of depression, always yearning for that open eyed, unabashed, wonder tinted awe of early childhood, being so lonely, so afraid, stuck in a perpetually self sustaining cycle of profoundly narcissistic self-condemnation and a powerful sense of profound lack,... literally wishing for fairies to just fucking come and take me away...(ha, ha. I never stopped believing)\n\n...I can't imagine a more delightful discovery!\u00a0\n\nI am absolutely astonished...\n\nI can't even...\n\n\u00a0 Samn wants to play with me! Go look at bugs. Wrastle in the grass. Play hide and seek. And,\u00a0 most of all?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nLAUGH.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 Looping, snot dripping, belly cramping, guffaw ridden, laughing. Not to leave out gigglings, which are their own sort of slippery slope to mach 10 joy and delightfully delightful madness.\n\n...What the hell...\u00bf\u00a0\n\nSamn wants to play... with ME...?!!!\n\n...I am absolutely astonished...\n\nI can't even...\n\nThe magic IS real, after all?\u00a0\n\nHuh.\u00a0\n\nGo figure.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 I live in this amazing world as a copilot and navigator, in a flesh vehicle, for Samn to have fun in. To coexist with Samn in abundant joy and gratitude. And, pain and loss, too.\u00a0 A partnership of co-creation, co- existence. Co-being. Bringing resonance or dissonance, or both, depending on the needs of myself and my surroundings. And, depending on my ability and/or desire to align with and reflect those needs... I think I understand this...\n\n\u00a0 You've welcomed us to your world. So openly. You are most assuredly welcome to ours. It's weird here. \"Normal\" is\u00a0 investigated, but welcome, as normal can be restful.  Nonconformism, here,\u00a0is mindfully embraced and mined for its bountiful truths. This space exists here, in this little room, and, it's everywhere and yours for the taking at any time. Make it your own. Go deep. Treasures, not monsters, are found within. It's a place we all share.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0I sooo hope we can learn much together. Thank you, deeply. Much love. So much love.\u00a0\n\nHarpteethtooter\u00a0\n\n\nEdit: I did submit it, then, in a fit of fear,\u00a0 deleted it 5 hours later. That was  3 weeks ago.\u00a0 My old ways cling hard. Since first writing this, I got sick again. Also, one of my dear roommates nearly died from a fentanyl patch failure, and then went through a week of spirit numbing withdrawls as she refused to take the cursed med again. We thought she was going to die. Even did advanced care directives. Ouch.\n\n\nI haven't been laughing.\u00a0\n\n\nSamn,...? Well, I've not been aware of Samn since that night. I don't feel that Samn left. I left. I retreated into isolation. Hiding in my temple. Reflexively. Isolating... going mad... again. But, it's ok. It's different now. I know too much to succumb to hopelessness again.\u00a0 It has already played out in my life and is now a memory. This retreat I do is because I'm unraveling part of the foundation of my identity. It's perception shattering work. I have to retreat to process what I've learned. To, ultimately,\u00a0 reveal the true me. But, damn, this house of sadness and pain...I'm currently feeling particularly vulnerable and limited in my perceptions. Targeted. I feel targeted, by myself.\u00a0 It's familiar and strange... Unsettling... somebody send me,... something... please...a pearl, perhaps...\n\nI meet with my Spirit Ally friend on Monday, and with my lovely Witch partner on Tuesday. (She's ordered me something to help me gain my weight back and we're going to talk about what I've written here. Awesome.) I'm clearly not without support. Nor am I in any immediate danger.\u00a0 But, I want YOUR support... I don't know why... I'm powerfully drawn here. Maybe cause I feel I need a,\n \"down to earth, practical, says what needs to be said\", Witchmom. Who understands what I'm talking about, in all that I've shared above, and can say to me,\u00a0\n\n\"You're ok, Sweetheart. Everything about you is absolutely Divine. Even the dark stuff. It's ok to be an artist. Your music is beautiful. It comes from Samn. You're on the right track. Don't worry. Yes, Fairies are real. Here, I'll teach you. Here, hold my hand. Let's walk. You just listen to\u00a0 the life around you while we walk. Just Be. It's ok. I've got you. Do you hear it? That's your music, Sweetheart. That's you, too.\"\n\n\n... or something...\n\nMaybe, just maybe, I'll not delete this... this time...\u00a0",

No one is owed a child. You can't just hang around waiting for some \"unwanted\" baby (even putting it in quotes feels cringey). Adoptees experience trauma not just from losing their first family but from how adoption, generally, is handled in the US. Many states protect the privacy of the birth family over the health, safety, and well-being of the adoptee. You can't request your original birth certificate in a lot of places. You can't call up someone that was embarrassed to be pregnant at 15 and ask them, \"Hey, in the 40 years since you last saw me...is your or your immediate family medical history different?\"\n\nYou just can't. Even if you do manage to track someone down - there's no guarantee they'll talk to you.\n\nThink about your family medical history right now. What did it look like 5, 10, 15 or 20 years ago?

Your message is lost in the anger it triggers.\n\nWhen I think about only what you are saying: you are uncomfortable with all the public proclamations, by people who are choosing sterilization, about how they can just adopt in the future if they want children, given that the adoption system in the US has some huge flaws including systemic racism, white preference, heterosexual preference, and wealth preference, all in a system that is not designed to support the birther... and they are right, all those things are true. \n\nBut we can still work to change the adoption system while trying to provide care for children who need it in our current system.

They ended up adopting two baby girls from an orphanage in Guatemala about 25 years ago. It cost them their inheritance (my grandma had just passed and they used the money for the adoptions). They genuinely wanted to give my sisters a good and loving home and tried to help them stay in touch with their roots. Mistakes were made and it didn't go as smoothly as planned, there was more trauma for everyone than expected due to the adoptions. Sometimes it was very painful and hard. But families are never perfect, and are always messy. Our parents didn't know that they were a part of the problem at the time. Now they understand that better, but back then they were just trying to take care of their three daughters the best they knew how. \n\nI love my sisters unconditionally and I am so glad that my parents brought them into my life. I believe my sisters would say the same. A lot of times it wasn't smooth or easy, but we got through it as a family and we are all better for it now as adults. \n\nIs inter-racial adopting problematic? Was our parents \"color-blind\" approach misguided? Is the system corrupt? Yes, yes, and yes! But like I said, it was never that black and white either. Life is very complicated and the whole situation was (and still is) much more nuanced than it might appear at first glance. Sometimes people are just doing the best they can and trying to make a positive impact on the lives of others.

It helps the individual uterusowners and their families from having their lives changed forever by unwanted pregnancies. En masse, it represents a systematic change; each individual's choice to never have a child may not amount to much against the patriarchy, but in the thousands, it is changing the dynamic of entire womb owning demographic, what can be done to us, what the government can do to us.\n\nI'm inclined to agree that there's a systematic issue with the adoption/\"purchasing\" system, how you need to be financially very stable to afford to adopt and it's therefore inclined against the poorer of us, how those who do adopt have... a pattern of bias. Just because those patterns \\*exist\\* doesn't mean that anyone \\*else\\* choosing to adopt a child who needs a home, for completely benevolent reasons, automatically becomes part of that.

The adoption and foster system in America seems completely awful. \n\nI am supportive of women choosing to get sterilised if they want to. I also support people who are childfree. However, if they think there\u2019s even an inkling that they may want children in the future - then don\u2019t get sterilised. Saying you\u2019ll just adopt in that case is not a good alternative. Adoption is not a simple, clean-cut solution. Even when it is done ethically, it is a very long and difficult process. You could apply to adopt a certain child, and it could be years before you are actually able to have them with you, due to all of the legal processes. Not to mention, that many parents are not equipped to deal with the trauma that the majority of adoptees have. And, many parents want to experience having a biological child, and nothing is wrong with that.\n\nI feel like a lot of women now are taking the decision of sterilisation way too lightly and too early. My aunt for example, was so adamant that she never wanted kids. She was so 100% certain of it throughout her teens and twenties. However, when she entered her thirties, she happened to change her mind. She wouldn\u2019t have been able to then have her 3 kids (my cousins) if she had already gotten sterilised. \n\nThis is why I am cautious to support women getting sterilised in their early or mid twenties, even late twenties is quite young. People will obviously crucify me for saying all of this, but it is a permanent choice for something that could be a temporary feeling. I understand wanting it if you are experiencing severe pain from periods, but otherwise, why remove the option completely for your entire life? We never know how our lives and preferences will change. We have many decades to live on this earth, and we are ever-changing. I think that it is better to have the option open, and never use it, rather than to cut it off and regret it later in life.",

Adoption is an expensive process that automatically favors the wealthy and the upper class. We say \u201cadoption,\u201d but the reality is that you are purchasing a child. The primary reason children are surrendered for adoption is lack of financial stability, and people thinking the child will have a better life with a family that won\u2019t have to worry about being able to afford food. Both the foster and state adoption systems offer financial aid to families who adopt children, but they will not offer the same aid to the mothers, who are traumatized by poverty and the surrender of their infants.  These systems always favor white parents, even if only for the reason that the racial wealth gap leaves many Black and Hispanic families unable to afford adoption. \n    \nAre there times where adoption is fine? Yes, of course. But those are exceptions. Adoptees, in their own words, express feelings of abandonment and worthlessness at the idea that their birth mothers didn\u2019t want them. Transracial adoption is even more traumatic for children, sometimes because of their families and sometimes because of their communities. \n     \nYou should foster children if you want to, and are able; eventually an adoption might be in your future. But contribute to change in systems that would allow every mother to keep her baby if she wanted to. Work to build strong communities and focus on unity. \n    \nFeminism is not doing whatever you want. Real feminism, intersectional feminism, is looking at the systems that white supremacy instilled, and trying to dismantle them while doing as little damage as possible to the people caught in their gears. You want to get your tubes tied, or get a vasectomy, to prove that the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t have control of your life? The decisions they are making are about ALL of us, so any personal choices you make don\u2019t help other people. It is not feminist praxis to get sterilized, it is praxis to work make T-shirts supporting Universal Child Care and Paid Parental Leave. I know what I\u2019m saying is unpopular, but it is true. I thought I could just adopt later in life if I ever wanted kids, and now that I\u2019m later in life and I\u2019ve looked into it, it\u2019s a fucking shit show.

(Granted there are obviously more, but this is focused on the two mentioned. There's a conflict not just between the two personally (usually) but also a conflict between their deeper meanings and how a woman could/'should' be. And these archetypes don't refer to skin tone (though it's ironic some characters from either type may have at least one physical trait associated with the title (ex. hair color).)\n\nLight Beauty- A character who presents that form of 'innocence' or 'purity', deriving the position as the 'good girl/woman'. She is dependent on others whether or not she likes it or realizes it or not. Being 'submissive' and 'obedient' are also part of what makes this character the way she is. Stories of her trying to shed or keep her 'purity' are one of the major conflicts in the plot. This entwines within how girls will sometimes try to remain 'pure', with this usually if not always meaning sex. From having this emplored by those who raise her to be this way so she can be 'moral' and 'pure'. Also dressing modestly or being sure not to question/oppose authority or to make herself being the authoritative figure. People will often 'speak for her', trying to keep her the way they want her to (usually by men, but sadly other women do this as well). She is pushed to be meek by those in her environment as she can remain pure and to make sure she doesn't become an 'undesirable', 'heathen', or any/all of the degrading terms used to describe women who are liberated (especially sexually), etc. She is 'respected' but not desired.\n\nDark Beauty- A character who is the opposite of the Light Beauty (obviously). She is independent, worldly, a woman with perhaps some semblance of power, and not under the command of any man. For this she is portrayed as 'wicked', that she doesn't conform to society's rules (specifically a patriarchy's) and that everything that makes her what she is immoral and/or unholy. She gets what she wants/tries to get what she wants through different means: sexual, manipulation, will, or violence. Stories portray her as a woman who defies the 'will of the people' (usually sexist/misogynistic men and women who are indoctrinated/forced into that way of thinking) and must be stopped from getting what she seeks (and is often 'stopped' most of the time/all the time, with it ending up with her imprisonment or death). Women who enjoy and seek sex, wish to have some kind of power/authority in the world, and/or want to be free of controlling rules (about any or all of these things) set by their parents, husband, family, etc. are linked to this trope. She is desired, but not respected. They are called all the degrading and horrible terms women have been and are stilled called to this day. (Sub archetypes of the Dark Beauty are the Femme Fatale, the Witch, the Vampiress, and the She-Wolf/Werewolf which I discussed in another post.) They are also examples of women who the worst of men use to 'justify' their belief in not trusting women and to control women.\n\nRelationship between the two: The Dark and Light Beauty are very much opposites. One is sexual and free, while the other is conservative and obedient. One is usually depicted as older than the other and presents the more worldly and experienced energy. This does not mean the other will see her as such. The Light Beauty is said to envy or emulate the Dark Beauty, but so many stories present it as her despising her. The Light Beauty perceives the Dark Beauty as what her upbringing has warned her not to be: rebellious, sexual, self-interested, immoral, etc. And with how these stories go, the Dark Beauty may envy the Light Beauty's innocence or will have disdain for her (which is portrayed as villainous). She may try to 'save' the Light Beauty from becoming like her, that she may stay 'pure' or try to rescue her from her innocence (though this usually is very rare and often goes with the way of her being wrong about what the Light Beauty should be).\n\nFor Change: Given for how long the 'role' of the woman has been depicted to be/should be that of the Light Beauty and that the Dark Beauty is an abomination to be weeded out is just another example of the attempts/means to keep women 'under control'. The Light Beauty isn't necessarily bad in herself for not having knowledge of the world, not having acted on ones' desires, etc. isn't bad. Yet it doesn't mean it should be put on a pedestal or something that be used as an example to hate those who don't follow that path. The Dark Beauty has been the victim and unfortunate scapegoat of patriarchal/woman-hating individuals to try to manipulate women into being that of the stereotypical Light BEauty: obedient, submissive, and under control. For a woman to be liberated (sexually and intellectually), to seek and obtain her own power/authority, to rebel against those who would seek to control her and other women, etc. is aspirational. Desire is something we all have, in any and all forms. With these two archetypes, it tells tales both fictional and nonfictional of what some believe women 'should be and not be'. But to portray the Dark Beauty as someone women could/should be and for the Light Beauty as women once were/a warning of what to not always be. (For the Dark Beauty is liberated and the Light Beauty isn't...and women should be free.)\n\n(I hope this was a thought-provoking and meaningful analysis/suggestion of two defining female archetypes and personalities. That and how the nature of women's desires isn't evil and that to act on them/embrace what you all want is something freeing and empowering. Let me know what y'all think and stay safe.)",

                                      "body": "Okay! So, I am very scared of general anesthesia (for some reason, I'm convinced it will kill me) but I had a surgery a few years back for a uterine polyp so I was familiar with what would happen at the hospital, and that helped a LOT. I was much calmer than I expected and the whole thing went very well! I'll do my best to outline the whole experience for you: \n\nI was not allowed to eat after midnight the night before my surgery. The morning of, I could have clear fluids (including tea or black coffee) with my morning meds, and then nothing but water until 3 hrs before my scheduled surgery time. I removed ALL jewelry (body piercings, rings, everything) the morning of the procedure. \n\nAt the hospital, I signed in and was put into a waiting room. My husband was told that this is where he would be during my surgery, and there's a screen with my case number that will update where I am (in surgery, recovery, etc). I was informed I'd be taken back for a urine test and some blood work. When we went back into the pre-surgery area, I was asked to take everything off and change into a gown and some socks. I did the urine test and had blood drawn, and then I was asked a series of questions about my medications, health history, med allergies, experience with anesthesia, etc. Three different nurses asked me the same questions so be prepared to repeat yourself! It's all part of their safety protocols to make sure they have all the correct info. \n\nThere was a fair amount of just chilling on the hospital bed and chatting with my husband as they like to get you back there a good 3 hrs before surgery. \n\nEventually, I met my anesthesiologist, who was very nice, and stepped me through the whole process. He explained the risks involved and what I could expect as I came out of surgery. He gave me multiple opportunities to ask questions and was overall extremely sincere and friendly. I felt very safe! \n\nActually, ALL the care professionals I met that day were AMAZING. They were so calm and genuinely friendly, and this helped tremendously with my anxiety. I think my husband was more of a nervous wreck than I was! \n\nThe last person on my team to arrive was my surgeon (my OBGYN) who is just a fabulous human and really made sure I was doing okay and ready for surgery. We had the \"pre -surgical huddle\" where EVERY member of my care team came in to introduce themselves and step me through the procedure. I think there was maybe 8 altogether. Two were doing their residency. At this point, I took off my glasses and had them put with my clothes to be returned to me in recovery. \n\nBecause I had mentioned how nervous I was, I was offered something to help me relax once my IV was in place. I asked for this and it was administered right before they wheeled me off to the surgical suite. Worst part of the IV was that I had to pee twice before surgery and it's hard to move around with those things!!\n\nIn surgery, I was helped onto the surgical table and covered in warm blankets. My doctor was rubbing my arm and a nurse was holding my hand. They gave me oxygen through a mask and asked me to take a few deep breaths. They asked if I was warm enough. I remember agreeing once and then I was waking up in the recovery suite!\n\nI woke up sitting up in a hospital bed with my IV still in and administering fluids. A nurse was right there and asked me how I was feeling. I got the impression I'd been talking to her for a bit but this was my first memory of it. I didn't have much pain at all and was mainly super nauseated. She gave me something for that in my IV and then asked me if I'd like a drink. I had 2 cups of tea and a jello during my time there, and also one oxycodone pill for pain. By that point, I was fully awake and ready to see my husband! \n\nI was given cloths to clean up (there was a fair amount of vaginal bleeding possibly because they found another polyp while in there and did a D&C to really thin out the uterine lining/wall), sanitary pads, and my clothes. Once I was ready to go, they wheeled me down to the front entrance where my husband had the car pulled up. You will need someone to drive you home. they won't discharge you without one!\n\nAs for my recovery, it's been really good! I was very uncomfortable for the first 2 days. Not so much due to pain but just general swelling and some mild tugging sensations. It was hard to sleep because I couldn't roll around as easily and I'm a restless sleeper. I think this period would have been easier if I'd known in advance that oxycodone makes me sick. I had to stop taking it after just 2 doses so was relying on Tylenol and ibuprofen for pain management. Lesson learned!\n\nI didn't drive for the first few days and I made a point to do as little as possible. Once the swelling and discomfort started to fade around day 3, I slowly started to be more mobile. I already have some weight restrictions due to degenerative disc disease and I made a point of not lifting anything heavier than a cup of tea for a bit! \n\nI was told to wait a week before returning to swimming (my primary form of exercise) and to use Tegaderm on the incisions. That's gone very well! I didn't return to lifting heavy bee boxes in the apiary until after 2 weeks because I really wanted to make sure I didn't hurt myself. I was grocery shopping and doing normal chores within 4 days of the surgery. \n\nToday is actually 3 weeks exactly since the surgery and I'm back to normal! My incisions are a little tender to the touch still but almost fully healed. I have my follow up visit on Monday. \n\nEmotionally, this experience made me think a lot about the maiden, mother, crone phases of life and how my maiden phase is well and truly behind me! I feel secure that my mother phase is in full swing since motherhood isn't defined by biological ability to reproduce, IMO. I'm definitely mothering the hell out of all my animals and bees! \ud83d\ude02  I also had a lot of long talks with my husband about children. We really made sure that both of us were 100% on the same page and that neither of us had changed our minds or had any doubts. I've always known this is something I wanted but I did feel sad on and off leading up to the surgery, as part of me has always wanted to WANT children. I see some of my friends with their families and I wish I could want that but, ultimately, I just can't. I tried to let myself feel all the different emotions that came up without judgement, and I talked to my therapist about it before and after the surgery as well. \n\nOverall, the whole thing was a good experience for me and I feel very grateful! \n\nThis is super long but I hope it helps. \u2764\ufe0f Please feel free to ask any questions!",

That's often intertwined with monogamy but the two are separable.\n\nAdditionally, the biggest inequity in the way modern, American monogamy tends to work isn't about sex, but about emotional bandwidth and support. Men are socialized out of having emotionally intimate friendships with other men, and taught that this kind of closeness with a woman *has* to come with romantic or sexual desire, and it leads to many men expecting their wife or girlfriend to be their sole confidante, their only source of emotional support, their everything.\n\nIt's not a fair thing to ask of anyone, no matter how much they love you. Women are more likely to have close friendships outside of their marriage or romantic relationship, but men end up leaning too hard on their spouse, to her detriment.\n\nI tried a poly relationship when I was younger, and it wasn't for me, but I *did* learn a lot of valuable lessons about how different types of relationships satisfy different needs, and came away having largely deconstructed that expectation, that my girlfriend or wife should be my everything and my whole world.

So here's what's on my mind: I've never had strong bodily dysphoria - mostly I just seem to be cut from a more masculine cloth in terms of personality and interests, which hasn't necessarily conflicted with the body I was born into (thanks to badass feminist women and queer/lesbian activists of history, and the privilege of living in a queer-friendly city). That is, I've never had strong bodily dysphoria ***UNTIL*** the fucking Supreme Court decision. You know the one.\n\nWith my reproductive rights under attack, I can't help but view my body - my uterus - as a potential traitor; something that might saddle me with unwanted spawn; that could subjugate me to reproductive functions I don't identify or feel comfortable with. \n\nEven though, for now, abortion access seems safe in my state, my libido has tanked, and I'm seriously considering pursuing sterilization. \n\nI'm just pissed that these self-righteous fucks who hate trans people and think everyone with a uterus should be a forced birthing machine are incapable of seeing the irony of their actions: they are driving so many to seek sterilization, and (I'm sure I'm not the only one!) to view their bodies with less acceptance. \n\nI could write more, but **TL;DR:** it all just fucking sucks, my heart is heavy, my head and body are out of alignment because of the fucking patriarchy, and Christianity is a bullshit religion that should die.\n\n***Have others been feeling this way? Less in tune with their bodies (due to recent political BS)? Or do fellow witches have any words of wisdom or comfort to share?  Any spell, charm or witchy self-care recommendations?***",

That is what fascism is. Capitalism's final defense strategy against the unruly masses. Bribing one part of the working class to go against their class interest by achieving relative privilege compared to other parts of the ruling class. It was this very mechanism that ruined the revolutions of the early twentieth century. Monetary capitalism was abolished in the soviet union but through social capital, ethnic capital, ableist capital, etc. etc. old power structure remained embedded and a new class structure arose that was just as repressive and before long the people at the top were so entrenched in their power that they saw no value anymore in keeping up the charade and just ended the whole attempt. \n\nAt the same time women in america are seeing decades of gains being lost because in an effort to stem the tide of progressive populist sentiment in the country after the crisis in 2008  the capitalists have been bolstering sexist narratives to embolden a disenfranchised male base that could be turned conservative. \n\nFeminists fighting the patriarchy will need Marxism because you if you don't fight capitalism, capitalism will not hesitate to throw women under the bus to defend itself. But marxism needs feminism as well because unless women are given equal treatment, both legally and culturally, the established power structures of the patriarchy will find ways to express themselves that will bring back old class structures and reignite the flames of capitalism.\n\nSo absolutely, be here and fight for Marxism.

New modes of production arise from a revolution which itself arises only when the forces of production grow to such an extent that the existing relations of production, which had formerly served to grow the forces of production, act to hold back the forces of production. In the Marxist conception, it is revolution which, by the demolition of old relations of production, lets the forces of production free. New relations of production follow.\n\n> In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or \u2013 this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms \u2013 with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure.\n\nMarx, Preface to *A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy*, 1859\n\n> The two opposing classes in capitalist society are the afformentioned bourgeoisie and the proletariat.\n\nThis is false. There are *three* main classes in Capitalism.\n\n> The owners merely of labour-power, owners of capital, and land-owners, whose respective sources of income are wages, profit and ground-rent, in other words, wage-labourers, capitalists and land-owners, constitute then three big classes of modern society based upon the capitalist mode of production.\n\nMarx, Chapter 52 of the third volume of *Capital*\n\n> The material conditions that capitalism created made a classless, stateless and moneyless society possible according to Marx and Engels, i.e. liberation and equality for all.\n\n> In my view, and I am not alone in this view, there is no room here for a true dictatorship by a small group of people that has full control over what happens.\n\nFor Marxism, dictatorship is dictatorship regardless of control \"by a small group of people\".\n\n> Because the proletariat consists of the masses, this system of government must be democratic to adequately represent them.\n\nWhile yes \"democratic representation\" may exist, but it is vital to understand that this is no principle, but rather simply a means to the end.\n\n> The March article was in spite of everything very good and the essential points are properly emphasised. The same applies to the article in the next issue on the sermon to the peasants delivered by the member of the People\u2019s Party; the only sore point there is that the \u2018concept\u2019 of democracy is invoked. That concept changes every time the Demos changes and so does not get us one step further. In my opinion what should have been said is the following: The proletariat too needs democratic **forms** for the seizure of political power but they are for it, like all political forms, mere means. But if today democracy is wanted as an **end** it is necessary to rely on the peasantry and petty bourgeoisie, that is, on classes that are in process of dissolution and **reactionary** in relation to the proletariat when they try to maintain themselves artificially. Furthermore it must not be forgotten that it is precisely the democratic republic which is the **logical** form of bourgeois rule; a form however that has become too dangerous only because of the level of development the proletariat has already reached; but France and America show that it is still possible as purely bourgeois rule. The \u2018principle\u2019 of liberalism considered as something \u2018definite, historically evolved\u2019, is thus really only an inconsistency. The liberal constitutional monarchy is an adequate form of bourgeois rule: 1) at the beginning, when the bourgeoisie has not yet quite finished with the absolute monarchy, and 2) at the end, when the proletariat has already made the democratic republic too dangerous. And yet the democratic republic always remains the **last** form of bourgeois rule, that in which it goes to pieces. With this I conclude this rigmarole.\n\nEngels, Letter to Eduard Bernstein, 24 March 1844\n\n> Democracy would be wholly valueless to the proletariat if it were not immediately used as a means for putting through measures directed against private property and ensuring the livelihood of the proletariat.\n\nEngels, *The Principles of Communism*, 1847\n\n> There have also been other theorists that developed their theories of off marxism. Notable here is Lenin. Lenin developed a theory of 'vanguardism', which essentially means that he believed that a relatively small group of people that was educated in marxism should lead the revolution and educate the masses. He developed this theory for Russia at the start of the 20th century, which did not have a large, educated, industrial working class. I won't go into the depth of this theory, but you can probably see that this gives a smaller group of people more power.\n\nLenin did not deviate from Marxism. \"Vanguardism\" is simply the Marxist theory on the party. Centralisation into a united party was not an invention of Lenin.\n\n> If the workers are to be able to forcibly oppose the democratic petty bourgeois it is essential above all for them to be independently organized and centralized in clubs.\n\n...\n\n> As in France in 1793, it is the task of the genuinely revolutionary party in Germany to carry through the strictest centralization.\n\nMarx and Engels, *Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League*, March 1850\n\n> This theory was put into practice and further developed by the likes of Stalin and Mao, and has led to several regimes that are often seen as authoritarian. Practically all socialist countries that existed for a longer period in history have been inspired by this theory. This might be seen as authoritarian, but this is not what marxism originally was and many marxists do not believe in these forms of marxism (such as Marxism-Leninism and Maoism).\n\nThe ideas of Stalin and Mao are not Marxist because they were authoritarian (\\*On Authority\\* by Engels), but they were not Marxist because they incorrectly rejected much of what was determined by Marxism and the countries they governed underwent Capitalist development under the guise of Socialism (contrary to Lenin who was open on the Capitalistic nature of the post-revolutionary development in Russia).",

The quantity of social labour contained in a product need not then be established in a roundabout way; daily experience shows in a direct way how much of it is required on the average. Society can simply calculate how many hours of labour are contained in a steam-engine, a bushel of wheat of the last harvest, or a hundred square yards of cloth of a certain quality. It could therefore never occur to it still to express the quantities of labour put into the products, quantities which it will then know directly and in their absolute amounts, in a third product, in a measure which, besides, is only relative, fluctuating, inadequate, though formerly unavoidable for lack of a better one, rather than express them in their natural, adequate and absolute measure, *time.* Just as little as it would occur to chemical science still to express atomic weight in a roundabout way, relatively, by means of the hydrogen atom, if it were able to express them absolutely, in their adequate measure, namely in actual weights, in billionths or quadrillionths of a gramme. Hence, on the assumptions we made above, society will not assign values to products. It will not express the simple fact that the hundred square yards of cloth have required for their production, say, a thousand hours of labour in the oblique and meaningless way, stating that they have the *value* of a thousand hours of labour. It is true that even then it will still be necessary for society to know how much labour each article of consumption requires for its production. It will have to arrange its plan of production in accordance with its means of production, which include, in particular, its labour-powers. The useful effects of the various articles of consumption, compared with one another and with the quantities of labour required for their production, will in the end determine the plan. People will be able to manage everything very simply, without the intervention of much-vaunted \u201cvalue\u201d.\n\nEngels, Chapter IV.

I found this subreddit a little over a year ago, and joined it because I think it is a good and fun feminist subreddit, and because I think its empowering, even if I am not necessarily part of the target audience. I also generally share the goal of the destruction of the patriarchy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recently saw a post on this subreddit asking \"how many of you are Marxists\". In the comments on this post I saw a lot of hesitation to call oneself a marxist, criticisms of marxism and accusations of it being authoritarian, and what seemd like misconceptions about what marxism actually is. As a marxist myself I disagree with many of these, and I think that marxism can be hugely important in the destruction of the patriarchy, a goal which feel that most people on this subreddit want to reach. In this post I want to challenge some of the ideas I saw in that comment section and hopefully educate some people about, and open some minds to what marxism is and what it *can* be. \n\nA common criticism I saw in the comments under the post I mentioned is that marxism is authoritarian. I think that this is a mischaracterisation of marxism which is the result of a complicated history. I do not think it is necessary to fully explore this history to explain why this is a mischaracterisation, so I will not do that in order to not make this post even longer than it already is. I also think that this bad reputation that marxism has gotten is a big part of the reason why people are so hesitant to explore it and call themselves a marxist. To debunk this claim of marxism being  authoritarian I will give a basic overview of what marxism is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Introducing marxism**\n\nMarxism in the classical sense is a method of analysing society, and the historical development of society, through a materialist interpretation. It poses that in any society in history opposing forces with opposing interests arise, and our current society is no different. These opposing forces can generally be classified as:\n\n1. The ruling class, or the oppressors, and;\n2. The labouring class, or the oppressed.\n\nIn ancient times the oppressors were the aristocracy and the oppressed were the slaves. In feudal society the nobility were the oppressors and serfs were the oppressed (these are examples given by Marx and Engels). The oppressed class always consists of the majority of the population and are the producers of the means of subsistence for (most of) society. Marxism also states that, when the material conditions allow for it a part of the oppressed class will rise up, overthrow their oppressors and create a new 'mode of production' (slavery, feudalism, and capitalism being examples of modes of production). The latest example of this are the bourgeois revolutions (most notalbly for Marx the french revolution) which overthrew the nobility, established the bourgeoisie (which grew out of merchants in feudal society) as the new oppressors and fully established capitalism as the new mode of production.\n\nThe two opposing classes in capitalist society are the afformentioned bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The bourgeoisie, or the capitalists, own the means of production (read: the machines, factories and tools necessary to create products) and hire workers to create products for them, which the capitalist then sells for a profit. In essense, the capitalist aquires a living by owning the means of production. The proletariat, or working class, consists of all those who have to work for a wage to acquire a living. Examples of interests of the bourgeoisie are low wages and long workweeks. Examples of interests of the proletariat are high wages and short workweeks.  For the capitalists the most important thing is maximising profit. This is not a fault of their individial persons or personalities, the system pushes them to this: if they do not maximise profit they will be outcompeted by another capitalist. This constant drive for profit and growth leads to the continuous exploitatoin of workers and the destruction of nature.\n\nMarx and Engels posed that the opposition between the classes in capitalist society would lead to an uprising of the oppressed and the eventual overthrow of capitalism. The material conditions that capitalism created made a classless, stateless and moneyless society possible according to Marx and Engels, i.e. liberation and equality for all. This is also where \"from each according to their ability, to each according to their need\" comes in. This new society is what they called socialism/communism (terms they used largely interchangeably). Of course this does not happen immediately. Marx and Engels called for what they dubbed \"the dictatorship of the proletariat\" as an intermediate stage between capitalism and communism. It is a misinterpretation of this notion where I think the idea that marxism is authoritarian in part comes from.\n\nThere is much more to marxism than just this, but I hope that this is a decent introduction to some core concepts in marxism, notably historical materialism.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Marxism and authoritarianism**\n\nSome people have taken \"the dictatorship of the proletariat\" to refer to a dictatorial regime that oversies the transition between capitalism and communism. This is, however, not the case. Marx and Engels saw capitalist society as \"the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie\". By this they meant that the bourgeoisie virtually held all power and the government acted in their interests. Even if there was a democracy, it would ultimately be subservient to the capitalists and the interests of the working class would never truly be met. The dictatorship of the proletariat turns this dynamic around: it is a form of government by the proletariat and against the interests of the bourgeoisie. Because the proletariat consists of the masses, this system of government must be democratic to adequately represent them. I.e. it must be a democratic system that is free from the influence of capital, and thus is able to implement policy that can destroy capital, the bourgeoisie and ultimately the state and class altogether. In my view, and I am not alone in this view, there is no room here for a true dictatorship by a small group of people that has full control over what happens. This is diametrically opposed to the socialist ideal. Marxists want to liberate the working class, not create a dictatorial society.\n\nThere have also been other theorists that developed their theories of off marxism. Notable here is Lenin. Lenin developed a theory of 'vanguardism', which essentially means that he believed that a relatively small group of people that was educated in marxism should lead the revolution and educate the masses. He developed this theory for Russia at the start of the 20th century, which did not have a large, educated, industrial working class. I won't go into the depth of this theory, but you can probably see that this gives a smaller group of people more power. This theory was put into practice and further developed by the likes of Stalin and Mao, and has led to several regimes that are often seen as authoritarian. Practically all socialist countries that existed for a longer period in history have been inspired by this theory. This might be seen as authoritarian, but this is not what marxism originally was and many marxists do not believe in these forms of marxism (such as Marxism-Leninism and Maoism).\n\nThere are many variations of marxism, varying from marxism-leninism to council communism and everything inbetween, and while you might be able to characterise some as authoritarian, it is not inherent to the ideology and according to many marxists authoritarianism is antithetical to the ideology.\n\nThere is also anarchists, who think marxism is authoritarian by virtue of it wanting to keep the institution of government, at least for a time before communism can be established. This is, of course, a more fundamental disagreement about what authoritarianism actually means and what the role of government should be, but I do not think this sentiment is broadly shared. The idea that government is not useful and is authoritarian by virtue of existing is not one that is common outside of anarchist circles. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Concluding**\n\nI only shortly introduced classical marxism here, but there is of course much more to marxism. Classical marxism gives us an valuable analysis of capitalism and good ideas about communism as a starting point. It is, however, very eurocentric and lacks feminist and minority perspectives. Some parts of it are also outdated. Luckily many different theorists, both historical and contemporary, have contributed to marxism and enriched it with many different perspectives. Marxist theory is not religious dogma and the theories aren't sacred. Marxists should critically evaluate the theory and take more modern theory in consideration. As our goal is the liberation of all of the working class, and no none is truly free unless everyone is free, this requires the liberation of women, queer people, colonised peoples, and other minorities and oppressed groups. There is a rich tradition of marxist-feminism and notable writers you might want to check out include Silvia Federici, Angela Davis, Simone de Beauvoir, and Clara Zetkin. [Marxists.org](https://Marxists.org) contains many works that are accessible for free. It also contains more general works about marxism and other topics, if you're interested in learning more about it.\n\nI think it is a mischaracterisation to say that marxism is authoritarian. I think marxism should go hand in hand with feminism, and there is no destroying the patriarchy without destroying capitalism. Marxism has a rich tradition of critical theorists and can give a framework for how we can overthrow capitalism. In solidarity we can defeat the bourgeoisie.\n\nI hope this post fits the subreddit and has been useful to some of you. Thank you for reading!\n\nEdit: fixing the link",

Honestly not calling out Karens reinforces the patriarchal pecking order that some women and POCs belong on the bottom end of social status and deserve to be treated that way. The patriarchy is not just gender norms. It's forced racial hierarchy as well. As a POC, I have experienced unnecessary verbal abuse by Karens all my life, even now that I have a white collar job.

It does not matter if a complaint has legitimacy - for instance, a predatory late fee is tacked on an already insanely high balance because of late fees - because the response is ALWAYS defending the company (\"That's just policy! Don't be late! Manage money better!\"). \n\nI don't trust anything that makes people side with corporations or companies. And I feel like those in power are using the fear of \"being a Karen\" to silence consumers into demanding better business (or ethical) practices. How do they silence them? By putting their employees as the martyr - who they placed in that situation to begin with - so people don't rock the boat. \n\nThe truth is, people in general have trouble with expressing anger. White women in particular can't express anger in a good way and many privileged women are very used to things just \"going their way\" without understanding the work it takes to make it their way. But men suffer anger meltdowns more than women do (at least, the temper tantrums that are filmed). Women generally become snide or rude, but men launch into crazy shit. \n\nI just had to \"be a Karen\" to a company because they just wouldn't work with me and I was extremely stressed because I am out of town in six hours. It wasn't even a very large issue, but they wouldn't budge AND the employee spoke to me in a very condescending way as if I couldn't read. But now I went to another place way more accomodating and understanding so they now suddenly got hundreds of dollars in business. \n\nI didn't cuss or scream, but I was mad. It's a stupid \"company policy\" that was somehow written into the Bible by Jesus and I am sure the employees said I was a Karen.

I understand if you've moved on and don't want to continue talking about it, but it's here in case you are interested.)\n\n\nThank you for helping us get the crux of it. I hope everyone is able to start peeling away the whitewashing and see what this issue really is.\n\nAt this point it seems to me that first and foremost, white people shouldn't be using the word at all, as some have noted. Secondly, when it is used by a certain kind of person (white men, mostly) in certain (all?) contexts, it is misogynistic, because it is intended to be so by those speakers. But we need to keep the focus on the origin as much as we can. I hope it's in this way that we can remove a weapon from oppressors and keep power in the hands of the people who own it. (In practice that's very messy, and odds are probably not in our favor, but we have to try, right?)\n\nBecause it has been so appropriated, I'm thinking it's also probably racist (when used by non-people of color). Not that it's racist against the white person it's being applied to by the other white person, because that's not a thing. But that the act of appropriating a word used by BIPOC to express a specific BIPOC experience is itself racist.\n\nI remember having a vague sense of its racial component when it was first stolen for the popular lexicon, but nothing so detailed as white women weaponizing specifically their feminity against people of color. Since the whitewashed version is what has prevailed in my experience, that's what stuck. It also never crossed my mind that that would be what's happening, because that's not something I would think to do (at least, intentionally. I really try to avoid people, mostly). That racists would use their whiteness, yes, but not to add their feminity on top of it. That's especially heinous. \n\nObviously, it was there all along. But oppressors did what oppressers do and obfuscated the origin, making it more difficult for those of us who don't witness this very particular brand of racism on a regular basis to see the truth of the matter. \n\nThese are not experiences I want you or anyone else to have to suffer through. Thank you for sharing, participating, and educating. It isn't any particular person's responsibility to do this, and I'm grateful for your (and many others') willingness to engage in multiple places and multiple ways so there's a greater chance for more people to learn, myself included.

I mean, The Birth of a Nation specifically put forth the idea of the KKK being heroes because they protected primarily white women from black men. Many white women are used to people assuming their innocence & coming to their aid. If a white girl goes missing, it's on the front page of every publication, everyone's talking about it & looking for her, people are offering huge rewards... but poc women get brushed aside by the police themselves let alone the news & the public. Emmett Till was a freaking child but protecting a white *woman's* honor meant more than the literal life of a black child. So sure, men act like Karens but these white women really do it in a specific way oftentimes, that weaponizes their whiteness & their white *woman* identity, that makes their actions potentially more dangerous to the poc they target.\n\nOne of the OG mainstream Karens, Central Park Karen, literally said \"Imma tell them an African American man is threatening my life,\" them being the police aka the OG slave catchers aka essentially calling up BoaN KKK calvary to \"save\" a white woman from a black man who was actually not a threat to her. Many of these Karens specifically weaponize their being a white woman, something y'all not trying to admit, accept & acknowledge, which is key as to why Karen is gendered. It's not sexist, it's just a term to describe a specific type of racism that white women in particular portray. Though yes, the watered down \"lemme speak to your manager\" entitled Karen is a free for all. Know that this is a result of the term being co-opted by the mainstream so telling poc, primarily black folks, to stop using the term maybe isn't the best. White women feeling targeted by sexism really should understand why the history of the word & our ability as black people to express victimization by this specific type of racism is important & to not speak over our pain with yours.",

It's about the idea that I, and women in general, have a voice in my head that causes me to question myself when I have a legitimate complaint. \n\nWe know that comes from being socialized to shut up and look pretty. But it gets reinforced when we use a typically feminine name to describe someone who is being unnecessarily rude, micromanagey, and superior; someone who makes problems where there are none. Because women in general are considered to make problems where there are none by the patriarchy. \n\nWe also don't have a typically masculine name equivalent. I know people have tried to use names like Chad or Brad to describe men like this, but it doesn't hit as hard and we all know it. Men will still be called Karens instead. \n\nThere's something in that line between what is stereotypically supposed to be a Karen, and real women's real complaints and how they're treated by patriarchal society that just doesn't sit well with me. What do you all think?\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who brought up the original racial/anti-racist component. I am sorry to everyone it may have hurt to have that absent from the beginning. I knew it at one point long ago, but it has changed so much (in my experience) that I overlooked it. It's clearly very important that we continue to listen to BIPOC and remember where things like this come from.",

Not exactly about witches, but it is tangentially about the patriarchy, and how it effects me as a 29 year old heterosexual man. \n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve been coming to terms with the effects that toxic masculinity has on our society, including myself. It\u2019s come at an unexpected cost though. throughout my adult life most of the women I\u2019ve become romantically attracted started out as friends who over time exhibited qualities I would love in a partner. I\u2019ve never acted on them in the past mostly for fear of rejection and also because I didn\u2019t want my friends to think I only got close with them for the sole purpose of sleeping with them, which is definitely not the case; physical attractiveness is such a small part of what leads me to catch feelings. So I always let these attractions go and eventually the friendships fade in some of the cases. \nIn all this I\u2019ve learned that I\u2019ve stopped trusting myself when I\u2019m attracted to someone because I\u2019m worried about the attraction being for the \u201cwrong reasons.\u201d as a result I\u2019ve never fully learned how to approach the subject of romantic attraction with people who I\u2019m attracted too and have been in an almost perpetual \u201cunrequited love\u201d mindset, weary of become a \u201cnice guy\u201d who thinks he\u2019s owed something from the women he\u2019s attracted to. There\u2019s someone I like now and I really want to learn that I can trust myself with my feelings for her and that it\u2019s not purely driven from a sexual attraction (although that\u2019s there too.) I reaaaaallllly don\u2019t wanna fuck this one up because she has every quality I\u2019ve been searching for in a partner. she\u2019s also very much awakened to her divine feminine and very perceptive, and I\u2019m sure she senses my attraction to her.  \nI guess I don\u2019t really have a question as much as I\u2019m just looking for reassurance that being attracted to a friend isn\u2019t inherently toxic and maybe ask for some direction on how to approach the subject of m romantic attraction with a woman who can see through everything.\n\n*edited to add clarity.",

        "body": "**Preface**\n\nI\u2019m a lurker, I\u2019m not a regular commentator in this community and my witchcraft only goes so far in that I do it and my knowledge of magic is undoubtedly towered by others here. Please accept my writing in love and humility. \n\nNew light. Both are strange familiar words that are neither abstract entirely or wholly understood, for if we did we might not be here now\u2014or maybe that is why we are here. \n\nMy name is Micha, I\u2019m an American indigenous intersex voidwalker that would like to share with you a new idea about reality. If I have your permission, before I do I would like to share more about me so you know better where these ideas are coming from and why I\u2019m posting them here. \n\n**Prologue**\n\nI\u2019m at the precipice of my 30\u2019s and the last three decades have finally unfolded around me. \n\nI\u2019m here, on the west coast of \u201cthe greatest country on Earth\u201d when just two years ago I floated off the shore of San Francisco Bay waiting to die. And in so many ways I did and didn\u2019t. A paradox. \n\nThere\u2019s a saying that goes \u201cIf you die before you die, then you won't die when you die.\"\n\nHow does one die without dying?\n\nBy being more forgiving. \n\nIf you live well, you\u2019ll have died many sweet deaths, leaving infancy, adolescence, and someday adulthood to be an elder of your community. And is this not the dream for many? To simply pass on to the youngest the best of what you were given and gave yourself. \n\nThat is the cherished desire, the sacred love. \n\nWhen I was a young man, I was told that we only see so far because we stand on the shoulders of giants. \n\nAnd now no longer quite young or wholly man, I see the beauty and sacrifice of so many alongside the dominant powers of those looking for an ignorant supremacy. \n\nThat is what our time is now, a race against ignorance that desires out of fear and apathy to place all under their submission. \n\nAnd that is why I\u2019m writing to this community. \n\n**Body**\n\nI was brought up under the same system of oppression, but I did not suffer the same oppression. I perpetuated it. \n\nMy indifference and pride have given way to much better outcomes. To the faith that beyond any doubt we will reach Paradise together, the place where everyone is welcome, free, and healthy. \n\nI do not think this place is coming for us, we have to come to them. Why?\n\nBecause the home we are looking for is already with us. \n\nMy practice of magic, void walking, has little to do with physical movement, but traversing mental and spiritual space. Our body is a vessel for our mind and spirit, and I use mine like an observatory. This is what I\u2019ve seen. \n\nWitches. Be not afraid, if you\u2019re working within wisdom, truth, and love your energetic motion **will** dismantle the systemic corruption of the world. \n\nFine the fold between fear and apathy, and know the latter well. Where we need to venture in our work needs gratitude, forgiveness, and peace\u2014not indifference. \n\nAnd where indifference is absent, we cannot replace with anger, malice, and rage. We *should* fear some things, like not knowing danger. \n\nDanger like letting **the patriarchy** dominate us in their division. Division is the weapon and the word of women everywhere. Women are divided yet unified under their cry everywhere: **Freedom**\n\nAnd as women grieve for their loved ones everywhere, we hold the powerful key within magic to set us free. \n\n**Love**. \n\n\u201cLet the last word of wisdom be her first truth: Be love.\u201d\n\nThe new light is this: \nIt\u2019s all words, just words. \n\nAction with emotion. \n\nDesire with will. \n\nWill under love. \n\nLove in line with life. \n\nLife in wisdom and truth. \n\nAnd the **true** true is that this ain\u2019t it. \n\nThis world ain\u2019t it. \n\nWhat we built ourselves into ain\u2019t it. \n\n*But it can be*. \n\nWith new magic comes new light and a new age. \n\nWe are at the advent of that new age and the craziest thing is we have yet to figure it out. \n\nSo close, just past the corner. \n\nWe took the left hand path because it was quieter not quicker. We knew what The Left hid in the darkness was for protection of The Wrong. \n\nIt\u2019s all words. And now the world needs to know. \n\nThe Neolux introduces reality and magic in this context. Words, just symbols to convey distinct thoughts, are the foundation of the dream we are within and part creator of. \n\nWe co-create the dream and as witches, our mystical wisdom is the guide to understanding why we are here and what we\u2019re to do. And this dream is the anthology of our many lives. \n\nEveryone gets this intuition at some point and if you\u2019re here on this sub, maybe it was to \u201cdestroy the patriarchy\u201d and for that I\u2019m so grateful. \n\nFor me, the message that was given to me from the other side was simple: \u201cMake us whole, set us free.\u201d\n\nI was carried atop a great crowd of dim blue bodies, sailed to the window of light that would be my doorway. Their eyes glowed red and their touch was without heat, but not cold. They were me and not me. \n\nWhen I was a child, I was ritually sacrificed, my life was given to Jesus. \u201cAccept Him into your heart, make Him your Lord and savior.\u201d\n\nAnd it would be for decades later that I would test my faith continuously. \u201cIf Jesus is so powerful, He could save me always\u201d and so I prayed that if the rapture happened and my loved ones were whisked to salvation, I would be left behind to help pick up the pieces. \n\nSilly, I know. There was so much I didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t know as a child and still so much more that is a mystery to me now, but still that\u2019s a wish I hold true. \n\nBecause if the world really does end in accordance to what most of popular Christianity believes in, then we really have screwed everything to Hell. \n\nBig hump ahead...\n\nThe Neolux idea is this: \nAll of Christianity is a magical spell designed to outwit the most evilly clever entities of reality and we, witches, are the tip of the spear for seeing this master plan succeed. \n\nConsider that the Bible includes hundreds of years ritual sacrifice before Christ\u2019s crucifixion on the cross, which is then reworked into more timeless ritual sacrifice. I\u2019m talking loving each other even when it\u2019s difficult, that kind of sacrifice. Christ was about dismantling the patriarchy too and he proved it by the life they lived 2000 years ago, not what a diseased religion has invented with their pride. \n\nBig jump landed. Kinda. \n\nSo many of us grew to knew Christians as the single most disturbing power the world has ever known. A death cult that preaches unending love fixated on horror and pain instead of beauty and pleasure. \n\nChristianity is bleach, Christ is fresh water. \n\nBecause Christ at the source has nothing to do with purity in the traditional sense that the last thousands of years of humanity has endured. \n\nIt just ain\u2019t it. \n\nChrist ain\u2019t here to molest no children, they came to save. \n\nAnd by save, not dress them up pretty and put in a choir. \n\nChrist came as fresh water for spirits, which we are, that are ready to stop thirsting and become their own wells of nourishment. He came to dismantle rituals so we can make  new culture, new traditions, new society. \n\nChrist came as millions, if not billions now, have gone, pleading for a change. Begging for a new time to shine. \n\nThat time is here. \n\n**Ending**\n\nWitches, I know I said this was a intro and this feels like far too much to read already, but I am extremely proud of you who have embraced the craft of magic and I want to catalyze those around me to greater success in changing the world for the better. \n\nSo much talk about \u201cwhat is good\u201d and \u201cwhat is evil\u201d when we have yet to listen to the hearts of the masses calling for champions of LOVE. \n\nTime IS timeless. And love is the way, that red road that pervades it entirely, but only in such a thin way. \n\nI have no way to prove it, but I think our world is a reflection of the minute amount of time reality has embraced true, perfect, eternal love on a massive scale. \n\nOur time is a flash of brilliance, a supernova signaling to the darkness that we are coming to light up the cold and unhappy corners of reality. \n\nAll we have to do is act in love, which is faster than light not for its speed, but it\u2019s endurance. For where ever it goes, it remains forever, no matter what tarnish. \n\nThe work then is not to dismantle patriarchy directly by our hate, but uncover the tremendous love that has been keeping us afloat in the void. \n\nThat\u2019s all I have for now, thank you for listening. \n\nIf you have questions, critique, or feedback, I\u2019d love to respond.

Last night was a big work party at a bar. We came back to my place because I have a fully furnished basement, with stocked bar, where I host parties. This was coworkers I know well and some I don't. I always play bartender when I host because it's my bar in my house and it's just what I do.\n\nA girl who works for the company at another office is sitting at my packed bar table and I mixed her a martini because I saw her drinking martinis at the bar before. I did the exact same thing for everyone at my bar; Mixed them their cocktail of choice either by noticing what they had earlier, or asking them.\n\nShe wasn't first to be served so she saw me doing this. When I put her drink in front of her, she looked at it, then to her friend beside her and asked \"did you watch him make it?\" Her friend goes \"no, I was talking\" or something. She looks at me and starts to try to deny the drink. I heard her ask her friend that question so I said \"are you kidding?\". I have a sense of humor so I could have taken it as a joke.\n\nNow- if she didn't want a martini, she was welcome to have anything else. Or- if she didn't want any alcohol, she could have declined it outright. But she started to talk about drinks made her for that she didn't see made, so I interrupted her quickly with \"do you really think it's possible I drugged your drink or something?\".\n\nShe was being serious so I told her to \"get the fuck out of my house\" and I pointed to the door. She was the ride for a few people and one of her friends told me to not be like that but I said no, I don't care who she drove, you can leave with her if you want to, but she's leaving now.\n\nShe had her change to give *any* explanation besides me possibly drugging her drink, but didn't. No one has ever seen me kick someone out before so it really stopped the party for a minute. But she went out and we carried on. I basically explained to whoever wanted to talk about it that I felt disrespected in my own home for no good reason and that is cause for me to kick someone out.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# pains me to read this bullshit again.",

Not just for women, if I found out my boyfriend was withholding his asexuality to me only to reveal it after getting married I would feel betrayed and tricked. Sex is common and often expected in a relationship and if you are the outlier you should reveal that so your partner can decide if they are okay with it. This applies to other aspects in a relationship as well - if you don't like *kissing* or *hugging* or any other act of intimacy and don't plan on engaging in that with your partner you cannot lie and pretend like you do up until you get married.\n\nAlso, I'm sorry, it does suck that asexual people do not have as many options in partners as sexual people because of their sexuality but that does *not* mean that deception is okay. It also does not mean that they should just expect their SO to give up on a common, normal activity just to accommodate.",

I think people don\u2019t actually realize just how common it is to get a spiked drink. \n\nI was once out with my roommate at a college club, totally normal night. She was going to have one drink for the night so she could drive us home. We ran into one of her friends and he bought us a round, and I asked her to switch drinks with me because I didn\u2019t like rum. 1 AM rolls around and the lights come on, I\u2019m drunk and I can\u2019t find her. She\u2019s vanished. She\u2019s nowhere, and she\u2019s not answering her phone. I start frantically asking everyone we danced with if they saw her, and someone told me she left with her guy friend. It\u2019s completely out of character for her to ditch me at the club without a ride, I\u2019m drunk and not thinking straight, and I\u2019m pissed that she would leave me to get laid. \n\nNext day I get a call from the hospital to come pick her up. A security camera downtown caught a car roll up at 3 AM, throw her on the sidewalk (literally - she was unconscious) and leave. The monsters at least had the decency to call an ambulance, but not before they raped her and left big yellow bruises on her chest, back, and neck. When I picked her up she was completely incoherent and could barely walk (this was about 17 hours after I saw her drink her only drink.) We weren\u2019t out looking for trouble, we were just having a fun night of dancing. \n\nI still feel an enormous amount of guilt and fear because it was my drink that had originally been spiked, but I asked her to swap. Now I avoid clubs and I usually don\u2019t even accept sealed drinks from men. \n\nSorry for the long story. It\u2019s such a hot topic for me.",

Like, women are obviously facing the much more severe problem here. Someone's life being potentially at risk is a much more urgent issue than a small dent to someone's mental health.\n\nSo you can't just ask women to stop being wary around unknown men; it's a matter of personal safety. \n\nBut like... that does legit leave the mens' issue on the table, and there doesn't really seem to be a way to solve it without leaving women at risk. Plus, I worry that slapping men with that negative judgement helps exacerbate the womens' problem in the first place; if boys are constantly being told that they're dangerous and violent, I would think it'd be more likely that they fall into that role.\n\nThe only solution I can really see here is a (likely slow and painful) elimination of the violent aspects of the male gender role so that maybe, way down the road, men won't assault women and women's wariness will appropriately decrease.",

I'd have to ask someone eventually, and in the interest of my own safety I'd rather ask someone who didn't look 'shady'.",

I think the internet and overindulgent parenting has bred generations of men who don't feel like they need to respect women. They're used to being disrespectful online and getting away with it. Also, the easy availability of porn gives men unrealistic expectations. We've also failed to teach women that they matter in a relationship. That their feelings and their sexual gratification is important. SO many poor souls on AITA, who don't realize their needs should be met, too. Now I'm 45 and quite happy living a single existence. I don't miss sex at all.  I regret not having children, but I'm now becoming a foster care provider. \n\nWomen don't need to give up on relationships, but we do need to learn to feel valued for our own, individual selves.

Yes this probably took me too long to realize, but at least I got there. \n\nI\u2019ve only ever been in one long-term relationship ever, which was with a man. I thought he was \u201cone of the good ones\u201d but he had plenty of hidden misogynist traits (examples could fill an entire post, not least of which being he once told me I took feminism \u201ctoo far\u201d\u2026as if we\u2019re not still fighting tooth and nail for basic human rights).\n\nIn talking with all the men in my life, it\u2019s occurred to me that there is a certain level of misogyny that simply can\u2019t be unlearned in men. Even the most \u201cwoke\u201d men in your life will still interrupt you when you\u2019re talking, or explain your own masters degree field to you even if they have no idea what they\u2019re talking about. \n\nI\u2019ve always said that I didn\u2019t want to date anyone that\u2019s even 1% misogynist. If even 1% of you believes I\u2019m subhuman, why the fuck would I want to spend time with you? It seems clear to me that no man will ever meet this standard.\n\nI\u2019m fortunate enough to be (romantically & sexually) attracted to other genders, though I\u2019ve always been too nervous to explore this. I feel like the only chance I have of finding a romantic partner who isn\u2019t blas\u00e9 about my entire personhood would be to stop dating men. \n\nWhat do other women think? I don\u2019t want to become someone who hates men, but even the \u201cgood\u201d men I know are calling me crazy for being upset about my basic human rights being eliminated. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m ever supposed to believe a man has my best interest at heart. \n\nOn a larger societal level - does dating men inherently uphold the patriarchy? If we\u2019re still going out with men that hold a small percentage of misogynistic opinions (which in my anecdotal experience appears to be all men), how can we ever fully dismantle patriarchy? Can \u201chetero\u201d relationships ever truly honor women as whole people?\n\nApologies if this comes off as hateful or extremist, this is absolutely not my intention. I don\u2019t *want* to feel this way about men - and I\u2019m hoping some witches here can talk me off the ledge.\n\nEDIT: I really appreciate everyone who\u2019s taken the time to respond. I was worried I was going to get a lot of hate for this post, but it\u2019s been incredibly reassuring to read stories from all genders and their experiences in relationships. Thank you everyone for validating my feelings and ensuring me that there are also still good men out there, regardless of if I choose to pursue them or not.",

Just because things feel feminine doesn\u2019t mean society is oppressing kids\u2014for as many feminine roles the patriarchy pushes us into, there\u2019s just as many feminine things society views as frivolous or silly just because women and feminine people like them. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know anyone who wouldn't want a little cake and company in the middle of the afternoon.",

Doesn't that deny my agency by the virtue of my gender? Isn't that sexist?\" And the answer is: this is just the world we live in. And it's a tremendously sexist world. If you feel like you shouldn't at fault for something you had no control over, you're right! It's tremendously unfair. But getting mad at the accusation doesn't restore your agency - all it does is allow you to persist in your ignorance without the discomforting acceptance that you're the beneficiary of someone else's victimization. The only way for men to be free is to dismantle the systems that oppress women.\n\n/rant",

This moment happens at about 15:29 in.  \n\nJust watch this scene, it\u2019s in good fun and Carrie is forever an OG witch in my heart.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nInstead of making a new comment post I\u2019m using this one for visibility.  Sorry already, this is gonna be a text wall and I doubt I\u2019ll be able to tl;dr it.  \n\nA lot of my original comments for context and my view of this quote were in threads bombed by mods from brigading type behavior (which makes sense!  I default to the judgement of the mods for removing whole threads instead of bad apple comments to thwart further retaliatory comments off of responses to things with \u201cdeleted\u201d as the parent).  But seeing as I came back to reddit tonight with a lot of hate mail I decided I needed this as a high up comment.  When someone inevitably clicks my post history they can hopefully find this comment instead of continuing to use the post against me in bad faith.  Some already have, framing me as a man hating lesbian proving the toxicity of new wave feminism and thwarting equality at every turn.  \n\n*Eye roll* \n\nI usually can blow it off but given some of my convos on this platform have been advocating for men being an integral part of today\u2019s intersectional feminism I just can\u2019t let it go.  I\u2019m not Elsa, the cold bothers me, and I just want everyone to come inside and warm up.  That\u2019s what this edit is for, a little fireside chat to thaw any remaining chilly demeanor left lingering on my behalf.  \n\nSooooo, when I posted this I had just seen it in a listicle that was framed around this type of humor.  Meaning: the original context I consumed the quote in was definitely cheeky and meant for fun.  I *immediately* thought of this sub.  Here\u2019s an OG witch embodying so much of this sub by taking a swipe at the patriarchy using her telltale wit and sarcasm.  She\u2019s not truly hating men here, and I knew it from the set up.  Her stare delivering the line in the second frame surrounded by vintage late night Larry King visuals gave me a laugh and I thought other witches would too!  \n\nBut within minutes of me posting this it had more comments then upvotes all taking this very literally and I was *horrified*.  I really thought Carrie Fisher (and her humor) was mainstream enough that it didn\u2019t need a disclaimer but because I didn\u2019t want this to continue to spiral I found the original source video to give FULL CONTEXT to the quote.  Someone said I should have made a gif to be less insulting but I don\u2019t know how... I saw something funny and posted it in a relevant sub for that sweet sweet karma like most redditors.  I didn\u2019t go into this with some BURN ALL MEN agenda and neither did Carrie when she said it.  I thought men and woman alike could recognize that (again because of how mainstream she is!).  \n\nI thought that would be enough.  It however, was not.  The source was ignored and replies and messages continued coming in that I never expected when I posted it *here*, of all places... the amount of triggered messages I got bummed me out to the point of almost deleting this but the few (at that time) \u201cdon\u2019t be sorry, this belongs here\u201d made me decide to just keep it up.  I decided instead to be done with reddit and go to bed.  \n\nI want people, including men who I do, in fact, view as people (*surprise pikachu face*), to recognize my intentions weren\u2019t malicious. I thought the sub I was posting this to would see the humor the way I did which is why I posted it here.  The fact that it triggered a whole bunch of individuals and went to ALL was not part of the plan.  If I knew it would be read that way I would have framed the post differently (with a more revealing title and with the source as an immediate first comment).  I\u2019m still a little taken aback that it came across the way it did so fast tbh. \n\nSo in the end, while I\u2019m not sorry I posted it and am not sorry for what\u2019s being said by Carrie (given its context!!!) I am sorry it reached some sensitive individuals without the information to view it through the lens it was meant to be seen in.  (And am sorry I\u2019m ruining comment thread aesthetics with this text wall lol). I\u2019m glad the mods cleaned up the thread and stickied the video with a written communication of the context it was meant.",

        "body": "Hi beautiful witches! Today I've been having this question running in my mind non-stop, and I figured maybe \"why not ask a sub that is in touch with feminism and patriarchy?\". I really hope you can give me your opinions and thoughts on this, and maybe help me realize if I'm wrong or not. I am genuinely curious and I'm just trying to learn, so I'm sorry beforehand, as I'm just someone trying to learn about the topic. I'm also sorry if I offend someone, that will never be my intention I swear. \n\nSo.. here I go:\n\nI've been getting a lot more into feminism lately, and been learning about it for a while now, but recently I've seen the topic about porn and sex working pop up more and more. Now, I used to truly believe sex working was empowering for women, but now that I've seen the effects that porn has had on both women and men, on young people and in the way people think relationships and sex work, I don't know... I think it's just.. wrong, you know? \n\nSex trafficking, normalized stuff that is actually really creepy and scary (barely legal, teen, small, r4p3, forcing), addiction and it's effects. How come porn and sex working aren't just another way of feeding the patriarchy? The way women have to, certainly, fit a standard to work there and are overly sexualized because of the way they are showed. This also warps the way men and even other women view women in our society. This also implies that in order to get payed (by men, which is the main target) you have to please their expectations, which I think feeds more into patriarchy and the way we always try to make men happy and please them.\n\nIt's effects are also really devastating, and let's not even mention the way its super accessible to children and young people. Literally no restrictions whatsoever, every kid that will turn to a man eventually will watch porn and get a wrong idea on how women and sex work.\n\nNow, yes, porn industry is bad and everything (not trying to belittle the problem, but we all already know how much of a hell that industry is.), so we bring into the topic independent sexual content makers. Honestly, does it change really? at least you don't get to be in a shitty industry, but you certainly still work for the same target audience which is men. Selling your body for the pleasure of men... haven't been women's bodies already been sexualized too much? then why do we keep selling this idea of our bodies and etc. \n\nYes, I know women make profit from this, and from the stupidness and horniness of men but I still can't seem to find a good reason to explain why sex working overall isn't a huge problem for everyone, overall for women, who face being sexualized and objectified?\n\nI really hope you could correct me and fulfill me with knowledge and wisdom if somehow I said something wrong <3. /gen\n\nthank you! \u2764\ufe0f",
