A large part of the argument is where does life begin, and if that is a life should it have as right to live? Personally I think life begins at conception, but I also feel abortion should be legal at ALL stages (even late term) with NO restrictions. I truly adopt the its her body her choice mindset. \n\nAs far as birth control the same question applies. Do you define \"accepted\" as affordable access to birth control or do you feel birth control is an entitlement that should be subsidized by tax payer dollars? Me personally I feel that **access** to affordable birth control should be easily available in all states, however I don't feel that anyone should be entitled to free birth control.

They worked their asses off but they made it work without government hand-outs or getting rid of their kids (I am the first of three).  Not only that, we were all really happy.

There are extreme benefits and extreme burdens placed on women, specifically mothers, that are a result of nature NOT society.

I am not arguing that the rights of that individual are greater than yours, I am stating that they are equal and that the right to life supersedes the right to your bodily autonomy.  Your rights and my rights to bodily autonomy should be irreproachable until the point they deny another person the right to live.  I pose this very hypothetical situation to show that point.  If we all agreed and science could definitively show that a fetus is not a human life somehow, but your boyfriend didn't want you to have an abortion and took your keys and phone when you were getting ready to leave for the appointment.  Assume in this situation he is not being violent or angry in any way, but simply has blocked the door and will not let you have your things.  I know in this situation he is a controlling asshole, blah blah blah, but ignoring that aspect of it for a moment... Is it legally acceptable to kill him to get your things so you can go have your abortion?  Assume also it is the last day you are in the window for it to be allowed.  \n\nAs to your question of why men don't lose their bodily autonomy, they lose their financial autonomy.  It is different, but no less imposing.  I do not think nature dealt men and women an even hand.

If that's a reasonable thing to do, then why are fetuses the only ones that benefit? Furthermore, why don't men have to sign away their bodily autonomy when they have sex?

The baby does not \"use\" a womans body, that is its natural environment.  You put it there.  The baby dying in both situations (before birth, or after) you pose is tragic, but only in one circumstance could a person argue it is murder.  I am simply using plain language to show how those two situations do not relate the way you want them to, not to argue a point.\n\nI never said that having sex is consent to losing your bodily rights.  I said that consent to sex comes with accepting the inherent risk of pregnancy.  As such, any pregnancy that occurs even if unplanned is not a violation of a persons autonomy but the result of choices that person made.  You are using another analogy that simply doesn't hold up when comparing that to organ donors.\n\nLastly, nobody has the right to use their bodily autonomy for the purposes of killing.  The only arguable exception to that rule is abortion.  ",

Why do fetuses have the right to use a woman's body, yet lose it as soon as they leave the womb? You can't force a woman to use her bodily resources to benefit her infant, toddler, child, teenager, or full-grown offspring, why can you force her to do it before birth?\n\nFurthermore, if having sex means you consent to lose your bodily rights, you can still exclude virgins from the donor list and have donors be exclusively people who have had sex. After all, sleeping with someone is clearly consent to let a third person have use of your body.\n\nEDIT: Also, everyone is free to make their own choices. It's still douchebaggy to use your bodily autonomy to kill a person, but it's a douchebaggy choice that everyone except pregnant women currently has the power to make. I don't believe that it's ethical to place the burden of using your body for the greater good only on one demographic.",

If one of the few people against it was physically barring you from getting an abortion on the last day of your window to do so (not attacking you but simply not allowing you to open the door) would it be justifiable to kill that person so that you could get an abortion?  The difference between your analogy and the case against abortion is that you created the pregnancy situation, you didn't give the other person a bum kidney.  Your bodily autonomy has NOT been compromised if you aren't allowed a convenience abortion because you chose to accept the risk of a pregnancy when you have sex.  A guy has no recourse in that situation, he is either going to be a father or not on your whim so your autonomy is simply not in question.  The poor logic that leads to these beliefs is staggering, and this is from somebody who is not firmly on either side of this debate.",

So given that what else would expect except for bad arguments? To down vote the beliefs, when the very thread inquires as to those beliefs is poor etiquette.\n\nTo make an analogy that may be more palatable. Imagine a thread in /r/atheism discussing why people believe in creationism. Then a creationist comes in and says \"I believe in creationism\" then some one asks \"Why?\" and the creationist gives some bad, false argument against evolution. I think to down vote that would likewise be inappropriate.\n\n\nIf neither of those make you buy it, here is one last argument on... ethical grounds? I am not sure the term for it. On any issue, both sides believe the other side be wrong, both sides believe the other to have false information, both sides believe that the other side's beliefs hurt people. If everyone believed as you do, that we should censor information that is wrong and hurts people, then both sides would censor the other sides arguments, and it would stifle movement towards the true side.\n\nTo put it literally here is the consequence of upholding the standard that one should down vote false information that hurts people. Suppose this was a really entrenched standard. Now suppose people are discussing \"Why is anyone pro-choice?\" and you and other people come to the thread and try to explain why people are pro-choice.\n\nUnfortunately, this community believes as you do, that false harmful information should be down voted. So everyone down votes your posts and they reach less people.  Other people who were arguing for the pro-choice side may get discouraged by the constant down voting and stop.\n\nI don't think censorship has ever caused movement towards the truth. That is not to say that there aren't places where censorship is appropriate (safe spaces and such), but a discussion where the opposing side's viewpoints are explicitly asked for is not one of them. \n\nFinally remember that no one has 100% true beliefs. I am certain there are somethings I believe that are wrong. I don't know what they are, but they exist, and I would be really disappointed to find out that arguments against those beliefs were actively being hidden from me by others, under the guise of \"protecting me from harm\".",

I think it's foolish if she's persuaded only by anti-choice protestors, because although many may promise her help, very few of them actually deliver, but either way, it's up to her and no one else.\n\nYou are misinformed if you actually believe that an infant born at nineteen to twenty weeks survives, and that they feel pain at that stage.

Also some very few and very medically stressed babies delivered around 19-20 wks survive, they feel pain and you can still abort at that stage. Do you dispute that?",

In fact, they don't feel anything at that stage. And take it from someone with friends who work at PP: most of your protestors are in no way kind and loving like you want to portray them.

There are simply situations that would jeopardize the life of the mother. Very tough financial situations where simply delivering the child could cost her a job, with no savings and/or support of others, that can be very much a death sentence for someone like that. While the child might or might not get adopted, perhaps grow up to be immensly successful, i'd argue that not many people want to be martyrs because of a 'maybe'. Or maybe the woman already has one child and she'd simply gamble with it's life as well by trying to deliver.\n\nWhile i understand your point of view (i hope), i think there are simply too many situations where a full on ban on abortions would be incredibly destructive.",

If you assign value to that unborn child's life based on the mother's circumstances, then that's no different from pro-choice advocates who believe the value of a child's life shouldn't be higher than the mother's own choices. \n\nBut as we both can see, no matter the circumstances by which a woman gets pregnant--whether it be 45 years ago or today, whether she be wealthy or poor, it doesn't really make sense to create justification for whether a woman should or shouldn't have a child.\n\nIt's her body, and she is the person who is going to have to deal with the most consequences of getting an abortion or raising the child. To intrude on that with our own opinions and feelings it actually selfish on our part.\n\nI know you will probably disagree with me, but that's just my two cents. It is fine to believe in abortion for certain circumstances, but at least fess up to that being what you believe in.\n\n",

But that mental distress was caused by homophobic cultural norms, not by some inherent badness in queerness. \n\nI think there's a lot of parallels to the arguments about the mental impact of abortions - I doubt that women would be so shaken up by them if there was less stigma and guilt involved.

In other words, abortions DO NOT cause mental health issues.  \nI'm not sure if that's what you were implying, but I wanted to get it out there.  \n\nSecond, I think mandated 'counseling' again demeans the agency of the woman in question. It implies that women can't be trusted to make this decision for themselves. It's one more barrier to access that could prevent women from getting the medical care they need.  \n\nThere are already informed consent procedures in place, as others have pointed out, and the doctors are going to inform the patients of any potential risks - that's standard procedure.  \n\nPlus, logistically, who is going to pay for the counseling? Are we going to tack on the cost for women who may already be struggling to pay for the procedure? Where are these counselors going to come from? What education and training will they have? We already have a shortage of mental health providers in this country. What if a clinic can't find a counselor willing or able to work there?

However, quoting a Guttmacher brief, in several states, \"abortion counseling requirements sometimes run afoul of these\nprinciples by requiring information that is irrelevant or misleading.\"\n\nOther arguments that I have heard against the way mandatory counseling is carried out focus on the waiting period (requiring women to make more than one trip to complete their procedures), invasive ultrasounds, and the paternalism that is implied when women are treated as incapable of making their own informed decision prior to being counseled (where there isn't parity in counseling with other procedures). \n\n[Here is the Guttmacher brief](http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_MWPA.pdf) that I mentioned earlier, which outlines the number of states requiring mandatory counseling, some specifics of their counseling, including where information is irrelevant or misleading, and the waiting period for each state. Also interesting is [this campaign](http://thesatanictemple.com/category/campaigns/womens-health-issues/) by the Satanic Temple attempting to leverage the supreme court's Hobby Lobby decision in favor of women's reproductive rights by enabling women to refuse mandatory information that may be inaccurate or misleading on grounds that \"be[ing] subjected against our will to anything but the best scientific understanding are a violation of our religious beliefs.\"",

Why should anyone else be required by the government to sit through counseling they don't want because of *your* personal biases and opinions?\n\n> people have to go through counseling for elective cosmetic surgery\n\nThis counseling is more to protect the people performing the surgery than to protect the patient.  They are like EULAs.  No EULA you have ever signed has been to protect you.\n\nAlso, elective cosmetic surgeries are fundamentally different from abortions.  A pregnancy will lead to consequences for the health of the patient regardless of whether an abortion is performed.\n\nDo you also want to mandate (as in require by law under some penalty) that all pregnant women go to counseling where some \"professional\" informs them of the many options they have for dealing with the pregnancy and the possible consequences?\n\nThat is, if a woman wants to keep her baby, should she be required to sit through counseling (or go to jail) about what the consequences of having her baby are versus terminating the pregnancy?\n\nIf not, which of the reasons that you supplied don't apply in this case?",

Medical literature is increasingly aflutter with getting rid of informed consent because, realistically, even if you have a doctor sit down and explain things to you it will not make a difference. People are ignorant so, as doctors, it's a fool's errand to meaningfully 'inform' anyone who doesn't have a M.D. Sure, it's a little unexpected to get rid of informed consent by arguing patients know all they need know but if it gets the same goal, well, irony.

Counseling before hand should always, always be available and easy to ask for/offer!

The response I write reflects my own turmoil in thinking about the issue of abortion, and as such is equally conflicted.  \n\nWell there are several reasons.  One being the central point of debate over when the thing growing inside a woman during pregnancy becomes a human being.  I don't claim to know myself, but if the baby has a human shape, fingers/toes, and a beating heart (as well as other organs, that begin developing around the 5th week of pregnancy) then I believe it raises some questions as to whether the Pro-Choice argument that it is not a human being holds any water.\n\nAnother reason is that contrary to many peoples beliefs here, I would argue that much more misleading information is spread by those arguing the pro-choice side of this debate, and many young women are ignorant as to the status of their pregnancy during the latter part of their first trimester.  The common line that is told is that the fetus is the size of (insert item from pea to quarter size) and has no human characteristics.  In truth, the fetus' brain and internal organs are usually all formed and functional by week 8-9, simply on a small scale.  It is quite legal to kill a fetus that has a functioning brain.  It may not have complex thoughts like you or I, but it is very much an individual living being.\n\nAs I said, I am very conflicted on this topic.  I honestly can't tell you what I would want in any given situation.  I do think that simply saying that a fetus isn't alive and doesn't deserve the right to live is disingenuous.  Whether some posters here like it or not, it is a fact that there are a good amount of women who greatly regret (or at least experience significant emotional turmoil) over the choice to go through with an abortion.  Having a counseling session to determine whether a person is ready for a traumatic event (or whether it will amount to a traumatic event) doesn't sound like it would oppress anyone, and would provide a good sounding board for women/couples who are in fact conflicted themselves.\n\n",

There are reasons not to get an abortion that aren't religious, it's a big decision, and considering somebody could go their entire lives and learn nothing about sex education, this seems like something that would help a lot of people. I'm sure probably most women are well-enough educated that they don't need any outside input to make that decision, but there are lots of ignorant people out there, male and female. Even if the majority are making rational, well-informed decisions, most *people* I know are willfully ignorant, male and female equally. \n\nI mean, people have to go through counseling for elective cosmetic surgery.

The hormones involved in pregnancy btw (progesterone primarily), which are doubling every day you are pregnant from the day before (!!), literally drop off the cliff within 48 hours of not being pregnant anymore. This can literally lead to catastrophic changes in energy and mood and quality of life, and is something that most people are not even considering as significant after being pregnant, besides the fact that they fetish/mythologize it as \"the glow\" during pregnancy (you can be depressed during pregnancy too.)  So consider you may have deeper things going on than just your thoughts about it. There are complex physical changes that you felt and may still be feeling a year after.\n\nConsider that your hormones not only control your thyroid and immune system, but also your digestion (which regulates your ability to absorb nutrients) and your blood fluid levels (how much nutrients is getting to things like *your brain* for example...see magnesium and potassium and how they contribute to nerve health) \n\nOf course you weren't feeling yourself therefore, after having your body literally go through the most dramatic hormonal shift *you will ever experience in your life* and what's worse is you had no one to guide you through it and what you might feel. \n\nAnyway, besides seeking a therapist or someone trusted you can talk to about these feelings, I suggest you consider you really did go through a huge physical change, and that would in fact have an affect on your mood, yes, possibly even for years after.

        "body": "Today will mark one year since I was pregnant. It wasn\u2019t planned. I had just started a new job and had gotten sick a couple of times, when I never get sick. I had also felt nauseous every day all day. I thought maybe it was stress. I started to notice I was displaying symptoms of menstruation and thought that was what was happening to me. After a couple of weeks I took a pregnancy test. I actually took it to ease my mind. I never thought I could get pregnant. I have internal issues that make it really difficult and after being in a relationship for 8 years and never getting pregnant while not using any birth control I just figured it wasn\u2019t going to happen. I bought the test before work and took it on my lunch break. The first thing I said was, \u201cFuck\u201d. I was terrified. I called my boyfriend. His response was pretty much the same. That night we talked. He was very trepidations about it. We had talked about it years before and I always stated that abortion would be an option but in the more recent years he had told me that he didn\u2019t think we would need to go that route. In fact just a few months prior to me finding out he had stated that he wanted to get me pregnant. This might have just been sexual banter, but to a woman rapidly approaching the last years of her fertility peak it was nice to hear. As soon as I brought up abortion I could see him feel relief. He was very adamant about it being my decision in the end that he wanted to do what I wanted. I wanted to keep it. But I also wanted to consider all angles. \u00a0I knew that if I kept it, he would most likely grow resentful and it would cause issues in our relationship. I also knew that financially we were not prepared. I had just started a new job paying more, but that job requires frequent travel that I wouldn\u2019t be able to do for a long span of time if I remained pregnant. In the end I knew that the best choice would be an abortion. So I scheduled an appointment to have an ultrasound and go from there. I felt really hollow after that, when before I felt hopeful and even called it my little soybean.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen I got to the clinic there was an older man outside that shouted that Christ loved my baby. I wanted to break down but the nurses let me in quickly and it was dark and quiet in the waiting room, perfect for silent crying. I sat in that waiting room watching old awful Netflix movies with other girls in the same situation. Slowly everyone was called in until they got to me. When they did the ultrasound I asked for a printout. I said that it was probably a weird request but they didn\u2019t even blink. Pictures are important to me, I take pictures of everything. I guess I just wanted the only picture I could get of my little soybean. I still have that printout in my car. I was only 7 weeks. My due date was Halloween. Because of the state I live in I had to wait until the next day to have the procedure. My boyfriend came with me. Trying to be supportive but I could sense his apprehension. This was all foreign and weird to him. They gave me a vicodin a little before to help with pain and nerves. It didn\u2019t help much. My boyfriend came in with me, held my hand, but at a distance. He didn\u2019t want to see anything. I wished he would have been closer. It was painful but not too bad. I just wanted it to be over as quickly as possible. Afterwards they took just me and put me in a room with recliners with the other girls. Everyone had a heating pad and snacks. It would have been a really nice place to just chill, without the circumstances. After a bit I was released and they walked me out to my boyfriend who was waiting for me. We went home and I just wanted to sleep. The weeks following I wasn\u2019t myself. Throughout the pregnancy I was so overly emotional and I just wanted to start feeling normal again. The nausea had passed, the emotions stayed. Over time I felt better and better. Even thought I never could talk to anyone about it. I lied to the people who had known I was pregnant, said I had a miscarriage. I knew most people wouldn\u2019t look at me the same if I told the truth. I couldn\u2019t really talk to my boyfriend either. I think he felt guilty, that somehow the felt that I blamed him. I didn\u2019t feel that way. It my choice and don\u2019t regret it. Of course I wish I didn\u2019t have to have an abortion. No one enjoys that process. But I knew that it was the best option for everyone. I still feel like I can\u2019t talk about it. I tell him that being sad about it doesn\u2019t mean that I regret it, but it never makes a difference. I had several friends get pregnant and have babies in the past year. I'm finally getting to the point where I'll even want to hold a baby and not feel like breaking down. I think it'll always be in the back of my mind but in time I'll feel more and more okay with it. \n\n\nToday is the the anniversary of my abortion. I\u2019ve been so sad all week. Thursday at 3:45 I started crying and couldn\u2019t stop. I had to go to the bathroom and gather myself before my co-workers saw. I knew this week would be tough to get through. I even warned my boyfriend weeks ago that the 17th\u00a0and 18th\u00a0will be really difficult days. I texted him yesterday saying how today has been rough but I\u2019m trying to stay positive and just staying busy. His response was, \u201cwhy?\u201d. I broke down in tears and had to go to the bathroom to gather myself again. It just killed my heart that he can\u2019t remember why. It makes me feel like he doesn\u2019t care. I just wanted the one person who says they love to remember and he doesn\u2019t. I just want to feel like someone cares.",

              "body": "For anybody here directly, unequivocally (and callously) telling her to have the abortion or not have the abortion or to dump the boyfriend, I don't think what you're doing is appropriate.  It shows a terrible lack of empathy.   You aren't her, and you don't know what it's like to be her (unless you've been a very similar situation), to feel what she feels about her boyfriend, or to feel what she feels about potentially having this child or feels about getting an abortion.  To cavalierly tell her to go get an abortion or to dump her BF (or to not get an abortion - I haven't seen that yet) is giving bad advice.\n\nAll I have to say is that no one is wrong, and no one is right in this situation.  I view fetuses as potential human life.  They're neither just a bunch of random human cells like a patch of skin nor are they a full-fledged person.  Basically, they embody parental hope, that is their meaning.  In that sense I can understand you BF's sentiments.\n\nMy question to you is this.  It seems like the life you wanted in three or four years after you've experienced a little married life and fun with your (potential) spouse, etc. is being pushed on you before you're ready.  Can you imagine a life where you miss those three or four formative years, where you're responsible for a child, where you're married (I don't know how conservative you guys are about getting married because of a child), and have the obligations of supporting a family starting now?  Do you think you could be happy in any shape or form if this were hoisted on you?\n\nIf not, I think you have your answer.  As much as you love your boyfriend, being miserable will be toxic to you, to your child if you chose to have the baby, and to him.  Odds are that you will love the child, but at the core of the marriage will be the fact that he forced you into it.  What will married life with him be like?  I'm sure you guys have dreams, will he force you to leave those too for the sake of family?  What's he like as a person?  Mind you.  I'm not blaming him.  I can understand his feelings.\n\nAnd there's no guarantee that you'll find someone whom you love as much as you love him, but I am of the opinion that it is possible if you give yourself the chance.\n\nI guess I'm not so much telling you to go get an abortion.  But rather that you should answer some of the questions I posed (like how would you feel having this child and being married?), to steel yourself and be sure you want to get this abortion (or not get an abortion).  Once you have the conviction either way, then you can take care of everything else, like your relationship with your BF, your parents, etc.\n\nAlso, if you need help, I'm sure a fellow redditor or TwoXer in your area would be more than willing to help you.  Reddit likes to help like that.",

Not that they're plagued by guilt because they didn't reproduce at a higher rate. A subtle difference, but it does matter, if you want to accurately represent the results of the poll. Also, women in the U.S. were asked about a 'general ideal' on child quantity, not their personal, as other women polled were.\n\nFinally, the factors mentioned at the end of the article are generally more important in determining family size than just what people want. And they're the same factors OP is mentioning. The issue probably isn't women being stingy with their uteruses, it's more likely lack of key resources when many women are ready to get pregnant, but their lives are not.",

Here is my advice if you go this route: get the pain pills take them before you feel like you need them. Don't let them tell you to just take tylenol. I did that the first time around and it sucked. \n\nTake your pills and veg out on the couch, eat junk food, relax. I watched the entire first season of game of thrones, read a graphic novel and ate pizza. \n\nThere will be some pain. For the most part it feels like a nasty period that lasted a few hours for me. I only had about 1-2 hours of pain that wasn't easily managed by the pills. I think that may be in part because the first time I used tylenol which did absolutely nothing and the second I took the vicodin when the pain began to get bad instead of before.\n \nAfter I passed the egg sac I felt immediate relief. It was just an average period from there. Not a lot of pain, just a bit of cramping, more blood than usual but not alarmingly so. All this was worth it for me to be able to do such a dificult thing in the comfort of my home without being sedated.\n\nI want a baby so badly. So does my husband. But I would stop trying in a second if I knew he wouldn't put everything he had towards raising a baby with me. That isn't fair to the kid. What kind of mother does your boyfriend want for his future children? One who was forced into it and may grow to resent him and the baby? Or one who chooses to be there? \n\nI hope whatever choice you make works for you and if you want or need more info on the medical route you can pm me any time.",

I do want to say this, depending on how early in the pregnancy it is, you may want to ask about a medical abortion instead. You may want to take someone with you for support, but you will not need to stay at the hospital, you simply get 2 pills. You take one in the office, and the other within 24 hours of the first. It will suck but you won't have to deal with asking someone to drive you or wait at the hospital. \n\nIt's a shitty situation to end up in OP, I wish you the absolute best of luck on this. ~hug~",

Foster care adoptions are done through public agencies. **It's not like you would go to an adoption agency and they tell you, \"We're out of newborns, so here's an older kid\".**  You make the decision about what kind of child you are able/willing to parent before you start the process of adoption. \n\nFoster children are mostly kids who were taken from their parents by Child Protective Services because the parents were abusive or neglectful, not children who were voluntarily placed for adoption. Foster kids often have very significant psychological trauma from the abuse/neglect and have special needs as a result. Some people who are looking to adopt sincerely feel they are not equipped to deal with the special needs of a child who experienced severe sexual abuse or was so badly neglected that the child never learned how to attach to other people properly (look up Reactive Attachment Disorder). These type of people often want to adopt a newborn instead. I personally think that it is completely valid to be honest that you cannot handle a child with special needs from the foster care system, and there's no reason people like that can't do a perfectly fine job raising a newborn. \n",

I used the pill and condoms but somehow it still happened. \n\n\nMy boyfriend (25) and I agreed before sex that if I were to be pregnant we'd abort. Two years later here we are. He says he can't bear the thought of it and that if I abort he's not sure if we can stay together. I love this guy to death. We were planning on getting married in the next year. That he would break up with me over a clump of (life ruining) cells hurts, but I know he doesn't see it that way. Still I feel cheated that he changed his views. I know it's different when you're actually experiencing it, but still. \n\n\nWith our income combined we make over six figures, so whenever I say we can't afford it he brings that up. But ideally I'd want to have much much more in my savings before bringing a kid in the world. Plus like I said, the timing is awful. I'm not ready to be a parent. Three-four years-sure. Now-no. \n\n\n\nI'm very conflicted because I really want an abortion but I also love my boyfriend deeply. I try to explain to him why I'm not ready for a kid but he remains steadfast.\n\n\n\n On top of worrying about my relationship's future I also have to worry about getting the actual abortion, because my parents are pro-life and I don't really feel comfortable asking my friends to go with me to something like this. My boyfriend refuses to go. I can't go alone, since I'm getting anesthesia (unless I wait in the hospital for hours while it wears off.) I at least want him there with me, but he absolutely refuses. \n\n\n\nSorry if this is jumbled, I'm pretty stressed. I feel like the clock is ticking and on one hand I want to get on with my life asap, but on the other hand I don't want to hurt my boyfriend, who I thought I'd spend my life with. Help?  \n\n\n\nTl,dr:\n\n\n-Used 2 bc methods, got pregnant anyway (I was on an antibiotic for a few days and I think a condom may have broken once (*once!*). In retrospect it was stupid, but at the time I thought I was covered and it was fine.)\n\n\n-I don't feel ready for a baby, financially and maturity wise. My boyfriend of 2 years does. \n\n\n-He says if I abort we'll probably break up because the thought of it disturbs him so much. I say I just can't have a child now. \n\n\n-I haven't scheduled an appointment yet. I know I want to but I keep waiting, hoping he'll come around (even though I know he won't.) What to do?",

Pro choice often tells men to shut up. Give your money but this is a women's issue so don't get involved. \n\nBut this weakens the pro choice movement massively. Because abortion does affect men. It affects us pretty deeply. We absolutely should be involved in this debate. Because it's a human rights issue.

Men should never have a legal say. But we there should be a culture shift to involve men more. Because we are involved. \n\nAbortion isn't a feminist issue, it's a human right issue.",

You guys do get the short end of the stick by having no say then and then regardless of your choice, paying child support or similar of she carries to term. But that's life. It is ultimately her body and her choice, and you have to respect that. And if you're pro-birth, instead of telling *women* to keep their legs closed or just not have sex, why don't you discriminate more and only fuck women with your values? Because personally, I've always been very up front about what would happen if/when I got pregnant. If you're not having that conversation, don't have sex. \n\nAnd even then, she can change her mind. You can choose to leave her if you can't accept that, and I think that is fair, but ultimately you're only an opinion she can choose to listen to while making her decision. You don't have any authority over her uterus. Women and men have different roles in reproduction, so why should men have the same say when the act of reproducing falls almost entirely on the woman? You donated sperm, that's it. Childbearing is a life-altering and life-endangering event. Different problems, different solutions. --\n\n\nThen they usually swap to child support arguments.",

An adopted child often comes with it's own set of challenges and heart breaks. I dont know about other states but in my state foster to adopt is the most common adoption method and you have to be a foster parent to adopt. Since the point of CPS is reunification you get attached to the child and they get sent back to their parents or other family members. You also have to go through every step of the parents losing their parental rights. That can be very emotionally and mentally draining. Older children may have behavioral issues and trauma from whatever situation they were pulled from and need expensive therapy to help them.

I got a vasectomy this year.  My wife and I have two awesome little boys.  We had talked about having a girl a long while ago and my wife's second pregnancy was very stressful on her body.  We decided vasectomy was the best option for us.\n\nI make a good living as does my wife.  Between us, if we'd like to adopt it would be YEARS before we could save up the $35k or more it would take.  \n\nAdoption may be a great process for the people who already have money who can do it.  Outside of that, it is not an easy experience",

I'm just saying that for some (i.e. a lot) of people it is simply not an option even if they would be better off doing it. I know childbirth isn't cheap either, but speaking from personal experience it cost less than a third of the cost of an adoption even with a c-section involved. And unlike with childbirth, I assume with an adoption it would be a cash up front transaction.\n\nAnd before you say, \"but if you can't afford the adoption you shouldn't be having kids\" you can save your key strokes. I'm not interested in discussing such hypotheticals. People will have kids regardless of if they should and for those poor people who do we shouldn't be asking out of touch questions like \"Why didn't you just adopt?\". \n\nWhat is mind boggling to me is how we have allowed as a society for people to be so judgemental about people not getting adoptions that is even more so compounded by pro-lifers who act like adoption is some great process. It is an emotionally taxing process that costs **$35k**! It is like we are structuring our systems to discourage adoption while simultaneously acting like everyone should be doing it.",

This should go without saying, bodily autonomy etc...\n\nHowever, there is a time when a couple may wish to even the odds a little. Maybe they have been in a committed relationship for a long time, they trust each other and are preparing to have children or something like that. In which case I think it should be possible for the couple to both sign a legal statement that gives both parents equal say in whether an abortion will happen should the female fall pregnant. This solves the \"lesser parent\" angle as well as potentially stopping abortions sought in moments of lapsed judgement that end in regret. \n\nI think the key thing in the whole debate though is that the power in the abortion debate should be for females to give away if they see fit to do so, it shouldn't be shared by default. It is insane that a female who falls pregnant by accident may not have the power to end that pregnancy without seeking consent from another human who may not even be interested in sharing the burden.",

I mean, look at the title of this post. I think it's unfair since a baby's two people's work, so at least both voices should be heard. But hearing someone is not the same as agreeing to what they're saying, or even doing what they want you to do. After you've got your reasoned discussion, the woman can and should choose what she thinks is the best option, without having to be scared that someone will force her to do X or Y. \n\nThis thread is largely toxic. Yes, there are men who push women to have their babies, against their own wishes. Yes, those men shouldn't be allowed to do that. And yes, those women shouldn't have to take into account what their abusive partner wants.\nBut in a healthy relationship, both parties have an equal right to state their opinion. I think most of this thread denies men that right.\nAgain, after everyone has been heard, the woman is the one to decide. She will be informed, she will be aware of her partner's wishes, and she will be free to chose what she thinks is best. If it's a healthy relationship, she will of course need to tell her partner why she did what she did - not because he controls her, but because communication is key in every relationship. If the relationship's abusive, if the child is the product of rape etc then the woman doesn't owe anyone an explanation. \n\nMy point: this thread seems to deny men to state their feelings, their wants and their needs. I think it's important both parties can tell each other what they want with this pregnancy, but that the woman ultimately decides autonomously.",

That's only if you willingly refuse to use protection. Accidents happen. \n\nDeciding whether or not you keep a child isn't something you decide on your own. Unless it's rape, both parents need to talk this out. You both made a baby. Yes, the woman needs to be ready to become a parent, she needs to be willing to go through pregnancy and child birth, she needs to be willing to parent a child for the next decades. She'll carry the most of the burden. But that doesn't mean the man doesn't care! Not every man walks out the minute his partner gets pregnant. They will be a parent too, they will be responsible too, they need to be ready too. It's just as much their decision as it is the woman's. The woman's decision just has a slighter heavier weight than the man's in the end.",

I would look at it as a more positive thing that the guy you met was at least outspoken about his ideas, and I don't think we should discourage men, or anyone for that matter, from having opinions or expressions of empathetic value through blanket statements. I mean, men are humans too and I would venture that many feel deep connection to the idea of fatherhood and the children they produce.

I believe it\u2018s broad enough to include smoking, drinking, eating, excessive exercise, etc.  A prosecutor has discretion to go after those cases.\n\nThe good news: already was struck down by federal court.\n\nThe bad news: that was the point.  All these bible Belt states created laws they knew would be unconstitutional so that they could make it to the Supreme Court (through appeals), which would be more conservative based on the justices Trump appointed.  And it\u2019s definitely possible they\u2019ll toss Roe v.

We could *only* make the choice to have children the 'natural' way if I would carry them. No compromise, no turn taking, no realistic alternative routes- if we wanted kids, they would be grown in, and come out of, me.\n\nOnce we are done, it would then (let's be honest) be my responsibility to either take artificial, cancer giving hormones, or run a heightened risk of accidental pregnancy, which would *again* affect my body and not his. The *only* viable, long term option for birth control without the hormones and complications a coil can pose, is for my sexual partner to be infertile. \n\nOtherwise, I take on all the risk and burden of birth control, pregnancy, abortion, child birth, nursing and every possible complication which comes along with those things (of which there are literally thousands). My husband, on the other hand, would have to deal with absolutely none of that except the snip in his bollocks, which although there are extremely rare complications, there are no where *near* that same number of risks nor the general burden that my options pose.\n\nSo I guess for me, the conversation isn't much about autonomy as I *had* to be the person to bare children and give birth, so it is more about fairness/equality in our relationship, where I have made some huge sacrifices on his behalf, and he should therefore also make some sacrifices on my behalf. Of course I cannot force him, and I absolutely would not want to, but I would be pretty pissed if after everything I went through for our family I were then met with another 20 years of taking hormones just to avoid having kids *he also doesn't want to have more of*",

Being on the same page at the start prevents all sorts of messiness later on...\n\nMen have *opinions* about all sorts of things that don't affect them. Plenty of men are pro-choice in their opinion...\n\nMen shouldn't have legal rights to prevent something in those cases... Though I suppose on a social level, a woman who was in the process of *deciding* whether or not to continue an unexpected pregnancy might consult the father to weigh options. (Note, that's only in a conflicted situation). That would only be sensible I think.\n\nAfterall, plenty of factors go into considering an abortion, and the prospect of raising a child with a partner who wants it, is a very different prospect to raising a child alone. And plenty of abortions occur out of economic necessity, rather than a simplistic want or don't want choice. Having an involved partner can be the difference between continuing a flourishing career and sacrificing it to raise a family - which can also impact a decision.\nA partners willingness to 'pitch in' can make an option viable or unviable.\n\nSo a woman aborting because they don't want to be pregnant at all, seems perfectly reasonable. But if that reasoning is \"I don't want to be pregnant *because X*\" then maybe it's worth getting additional data before making a choice.\n\nThough I think we all know that not the scenario being discussed here. It's whether a woman who firmly wants to abort her pregnancy should be prevented by a man who doesn't. And that's a seperate issue entirely.\n\nI suppose (**and let me preface that I am certainly not endorsing such opinions**) that if I were to attempt to delve the reasoning of such men who feel entitled *on principle* then I would speculate that can best be modeled by looking at the different but related issue of men paying child support for a child they don't want.\n\nBear with me.\n\nImagine a happy couple where the woman becomes pregnant, and the mother feels ready to start a family. But the father isn't. \n\nWhatever route the mother choses, the father is now going to be impacted by the result. In many places, the father has no choice in the matter. He is financially on the hook, and socially expected to be a part of a child's life that he neither wants nor is prepared for. Ideally he would be able to give up any legal rights or acknowledgement that he is the father, in exchange for being freed of any responsibility. He's made it clear that the choice (and therefore responsibility) for continuing the pregnancy is the mothers alone.\nBut that's not possible everywhere.\nAnd suppose the mother doesn't particularly want a baby either, but has moral objections to abortion? Is she expected to either compromise her beliefs or take sole custody of a child that she doesn't want either?\n\nI speculate that certain men think of fetus as a full child, because that's the version that's going to impact them. They can't be pregnant. The *can* be parents.\n\nThey don't need to make the decision \"Do I want to be pregnant?\" They merely need to make the.decision \"Do I want to be a father.\" \n\nWhich is still a choice they get to make or should at least, and probably ought to be able to make without prejudice from society. (Or, more accurately, without additional prejudice compared to a woman making the choice that they don't want to be a mother.)\nI suppose it's also relevant that if an unexpected pregnancy occurs and the father decides they aren't ready to be a father, there is social and cultural backlash to that. *Deadbeats* etc.\n\nYes. If I were to try to get inside the mind of a Pro-Lifer man, I think that would be my analysis.\n\nFor a lot of men, pregnancy is seen as a temporary condition.\nThe \"Choice\" is not \"Do I want to be pregnant\" - which obviously only affects the mother - but \"Do I want to have children\" which obviously effects both persons future. And I suppose viewed through that lens it makes sense not to want your future be dictated by someone else's decision without your input. Men aren't affected by the pregnancy, but they are affected one way or other what comes after. And since men are only ever impacted by what comes after it makes sense (in a selfish way) that that's where their focus is.\n\nIn an ironic twist, the fathers own autonomy has been affected by something that is now totally out of his control. And in fairness, to a minor extent it is. And perhaps we need to look at laws with men disentangling themselves from families they obviously aren't a part of just because the share DNA, letting fathers in accidental situations 'opt out' of fatherhood, and the mother make the choice alone. (There was a horrific case in the UK where a man had to pay child support to his rapist after she got pregnant by drugging him, where this would have been rather useful.). But those are niche cases, and any argument that relies on a niche outcome is dubious at best. \n\nIt's apparent to most people I think that a woman's immediate bodily autonomy has greater priority than another's entitlement to a distant abstract notion of fatherhood that may not materialise. But I think I can see the shape of the logic, twisted and leaping though it is.",

I understand the logic behind what your saying. Men having 0 say would not be fair in alot of states right now given the legal rammifications of having a child and not taking care or it.

It would be fair and also terrible if men lost all responsibly and all say.\nAs for tubes tied or your own medical situation that should obviously be up to you to decide anyone who says otherwise is stuck in the past but babies?

The gap still exists.)\n\n- Lobby for better parental leave policies in business. \n\n- Lobby for affordable accessible to child care. \n\nJust, generally lobby for a better quality of life overall instead of this \"bootstraps\" bullshit. \n\nLobby for these things and, eventually, we'll have wage equity and move toward a society that's doing what a society should: taking care of those least able to care for themselves (e.g. children). We'll reduce over all poverty. Women, in particular, will no longer have to stay in relationships with someone just to make ends meet and will ultimately be able to care for children by themselves.  \n\nAnd I'm thinking at that point, the majority of women you might impregnate will - when you bring up \"paper abortion\" - be happy to say: Bye, then.",

A woman's bodily autonomy is a big concern for me. I trust women and their doctors to exercise appropriate judgment for this health care decision, the same as any other. They don't need me to involve myself in that decision. \n\nBut the fact is that a potential father *cannot* walk away from that obligation. The mother-to-be *cannot even waive the right to collect child support*, because child support is something that the child is entitled to, not the mother. \n\nAnd, for the life of me, I can't come up with a cohesive explanation for that except for, \"You do the deed, you're responsible for the consequences,\" which is the same kind of sex-shaming attitude that conservatives use to oppose abortion rights. \n\nI don't know.

However, to me, if you're pro-choice, you're pro-abortion, which I am.  So if a woman wants to use it as a second birth control, why not?  Isn't that her choice as well?

Please be kind\n\nI can\u2019t imagine a world where we pursue equality and a woman would require the consent of a man to get an abortion. So legally women don\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t require a mans permission to have an abortion. However, that\u2019s not the end of the story! There\u2019s a difference between what is supported by the law and what should happen in society. The law is only there preempt things going wrong or respond if they\u2019ve already gone awry. If possible we can choose better ways. \n\n1. Sex - sex is fun. I like it. I haven\u2019t had too much recently but I\u2019m a big fan! As living sentient beings who have to procreate (predominately by sex) to sustain one of the few conscious beings we know of in the universe I don\u2019t think we can separate the fun part for the procreation part. Whilst I liked the analogy about motorcycles it\u2019s moot. If we have sex with another person we have to take responsibility for the pre, during and post complications together. If one person hasn\u2019t asked if it\u2019s ok to do something then you\u2019d expect the other to ask. If one person unwittingly gave another an STI then you\u2019d expect there to be communication of the communication. If one person is doing something the other doesn\u2019t like the you\u2019d expect them to say something. If you\u2019re having sex you should be thankful! And take responsibility for what\u2019s happening. \n\n2. Communication - which was touched upon above. If a person is being a responsible human then they\u2019re communicating their needs. Whilst a woman doesn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t ever require a mans permission to do anything they should be consulting the other person. In this situation if a woman becomes pregnant I think it\u2019s only fair to inform the other person and start thinking what would be right for each of them. If they can\u2019t agree then the woman does and should have the autonomy to take any next steps they deem appropriate. \n\n3. Procreation - No child should be bought into the world if it\u2019s parents aren\u2019t able to provide an adequate life for them (security and love etc). Children need parents. A person doesn\u2019t need a child. I pray (I\u2019m not religious) that any woman who is pregnant (and any man supporting a pregnant woman) gives significant credence to the thought of what\u2019s best for the foetus as well as what\u2019s best for themselves in a final decision. If the relationship (in the loosest sense of the word), circumstances, preferences or any other factor is right then abort!\n\nThese opinions in no way include any pregnancy that is the result of sex without consent.",

I'm sure there are men who are fully on board with women's autonomy and women having the right to choose, but when it comes to that woman getting pregnant they feel that same connection. Men who would be willing to be a single father for 18 years but don't get that choice. In their feeling of immense helplessness they might say to the woman \"I don't want you to have an abortion\" or think something along the lines of \"how do I get no say in this\" but this feeling is coming from a love for the child, not from malice. Of course I don't think those men should be allowed to force the woman to carry that baby to term, I just think we're ignoring the fact that those men exist and it would be kind of shitty to say to those men that they just want \"to control womens bodies\" when that is not their desire at all.

You want a say in if the child you helped create gets a chance at life.  Like I said, I used to think the same way.  But here is the thing:  You do get a say.

If not, then you have nobody to blame but yourself, and frankly, you're being way too foolish to step in and decide that you know what you want all of a sudden.

I think it should be up to the person, but if you are married, go back to the previous point about your significant other being allowed leave you if you are taking children off of the table unless was previously understood before marriage. I think that should go both ways, BTW, if you are a woman who's husband changes their mind after marriage and refuses to have children with you, you should be able to separate at no-fault of your own.",

Should also have the right to suggest an abortion and give up responsibility for the child if the woman decides to have it anyway.  Works both ways. What if the woman doesn\u2019t want an abortion and the father wants nothing to do with the mother?  Is it fair to hold the father responsible when the decision to have the baby has nothing to do with him?  Sure, you could say that he became involved when he had sex.  However, that would mean that if his involvement in sex comes with a lifetime of responsibility for the child that results.  Why is it also not his responsibility when the woman decides to have an abortion without his consent?  \n\nIt\u2019s a terrible double standard.  If she decides to abort it against his will.  Nothing he can do about it.  If she doesn\u2019t decide to abort it against his will.  Nothing he can do about it.  Responsibility for the man starts during the act of sex if she decides to keep it but ends with sex if she decides to abort it.  That\u2019s a ridiculous double standard by any measure. \n\nEasy fix though.  By law. If a woman becomes pregnant.  She must inform the father immediately.  At that point he is legally obligated to either accept fatherhood or decline it.  At that point.  The mother can decide to keep it or abort it.  However she chooses is up to her.  If she decides to keep it and the man has accepted it. Happily ever after.  If he doesn\u2019t accept it and she decides to have it anyway.  He is no longer legally responsible for the child and has no legal rights as it\u2019s parent.  If she chooses to abort it and he accepted fatherhood. Her vote trumps his.  \n\nEveryone is happy.  Except on the rare occasion that a man wants the baby and woman doesn\u2019t.  It would be perfect.  The woman can choose however she wants and so can the man.  In the end, everyone gets to enjoy their life exactly how they want it. With or without a child.  Man or woman.  Seems like common sense Tom me... \ud83d\udcaf",

Plus who is very progressive.\n\nThings like this:\n\n> You're not discriminated because you can't get a spawn you can ignore for 18years. \n\nWhy are we assuming the man is going to ignore his child for 18 years? I agree he's not entitled to having someone carry his baby. But plenty of men are good dads who don't just ignore their kids? That's the old view that woman have to be/default are the primary parents and Dads do jack. Which is sexist t both genders. Heck, I know stay at home dads while mom work.\n\nAlso what the original guy said:\n\n> \"If the woman wants an abortion, the man usually has no say in it at all, which makes him a lesser parent automatically. I'm not sure how to do that differently but I think it's kind of messed up that it is that way.\" \n\nI can empathize with? He didn't say men SHOULD get to decide or even have a vote. He said he isn't sure how one would do that differently, presumably because he respects it's the woman's body. But it is true, men have less agency in an \"Oops\" pregnancy. A woman can end a pregnancy if she dosen't want the child and he can't. And a woman can terminate a fetus that a man felt emotionally attached to as a child and he might feel heart broken just like if there had been a miscarriage. \n\nThat is unequal, and I can understand why men might have feelings about that. Just because you know you can't force a woman to have an abortion dosen't mean you aren't maybe dreading being a dad at 16. Or dosen't mean you can't feel sad and helpless about the loss of a potential child you had feelings for. \n\nI agree though, I don't see how we can do it differently. It's just sort of how it is. Having children is innately unequally due to the biological genders. Woman have more choice and woman have more burden. Both of those things can feel pretty unfair to some people sometimes. Because yeah, it's not equal.",

I can aknowledge that there is a contol disparity with a pregnancy, but that it is an unsolvable problem. The women decides if she wants the child or not. That is a fact.

I just want to make clear, that you can have both positions\n\nAnother point they talked about also was child support.

If both of you are responsible adults, without the wish to have kids, get your shit together and use protection. And I MEAN that for BOTH sexes. Yes, a man can't use a pill, but use a condom instead. You are \\_BOTH\\_ responsible for it.\n\nAn abortion should be the LAST, WORST CASE scenario. Aside from the fact, that you kill a new life here (basically, not going religious here), it can hurt/endanger the womens body in many ways. Not to mention psychologically. You should do everything in your power so you won't even need one. And there's almost zero chance that protection on women and men side fail at the same time.\n\nFor the abortion itself ... well ... if it's an onenightstand, yes, the man shouldn't have a say in it. But as I said - why the fuck did both of you stop being responsible - especially in that case - and didn't use protection? Even more so, because STD's are a thing you know. But yes - if it still happens, for whatever reason, it's not something the man has IMHO any say in it. Hell, he wouldn't even know in most of those cases.\n\nBut if you are in healthy relationship - yes - your partner SHOULD have a say in it and you should RESPECTFULLY talk about it. You both created and are responsible for a new life being underway. This ALSO goes beyond the pregnancy alone, as this is a life long commitment to the child. For BOTH parties. Same with tying the tubes or getting a vasectomy.\n\nIf you respect and value your partner, you talk with him or her about it. It's not only you, it's both and the decision will impact both of you. Heavily, for life. You should both work together in how you wanna deal with this.\n\nThe talking is also important, if you want a sterilisation. Even more so, if the women gets the \"tubes tied\", because that can't be undone and it's a risky operation. With a mens vasectomy, there's a chance to build it back and/or have a sperm extraction, should both of you decide otherwise and want kids in the future. Not to mention that a vasectomy is a tiny operation, with mostly the downside of blue balls for some days :)\n\nHell, I'll get one next week and talked with my wife before, as this is simply a matter that will impact both of us. And we both talked about it for a longer time, as we both decided to not have more kids. (We might like more, but it's also a thing about financial status, living situation etc. Just because it could work, doesn't mean you should do it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not saying anyone needs permission from their partner. After all it's your body and you have to decide what to do with it. BUT you should be respectful to your SO and talk about it. And yes, there might be the case your partner might have a different view on it. You might have a quarrel about it. But this is about respect and love. And USUALLY your partner should also be fine with your decision, even if he or she has problems to accept it.\n\nBut simply doing, not talking about and telling your partner to go fuck himself in a way? Why the fuck are you even together then? Yes, it's your decision at the end of the day, but don't complain if you don't like the reaction that can grow out of it.\n\nHonestly - if my wife was pregnant or wanted the tubes tied, I would talk with her about it.

I cant speak for all men here, but my perspective is that men should have more equal of a say depending on the relationship you have with them, because the bigger the relationship the bigger the trust and respect has to go both ways. Obviously if a man rapes a woman he should have no say, and frankly id like to do the castration on him myself. But when its you boyfriend, maybe you should sit down and at least hear him out but you still have final say. With a husband I do think you should strongly take into account what hes thinking. Sometimes men want kids, and we physically cannot have them ourselves, so we actually have to rely on our better halves.\n\nI know im a man and i could never know what having a baby is like, but no relationship should completely dismiss the other party without hearing them out or anything.

To them, the ending of a life is a tragedy, and must be prevented at all costs, and if they consider abortion to be ending a life they feel it is their ethical responsibility to prevent it. How are we to go about convincing someone that the ending of a \"life\" isn't a bad thing? You say in your post \" the topic of abortion is very complicated (and I'm not going to start a debate on it, because that'll only end in war) -why the fuck do some men still jump around this topic?\" not seeming to realize you're avoiding the answer to your own question. Some men jump around because it IS a complicated topic.  Though it is often about control, it's not always, and we can't treat both parties the same and expect to get anywhere.",

We wanted to have a baby. We wanted the baby soooo bad. She got pregnant and the little issues we had before, started getting more severe. She like to hit me. A lot. And I ignored it or looked past it. I was in love right? I was a \"man and should be able to take it\" as she said. So I did. And I loved her and worked hard so we could try and have a life together. Well one night she couldn't sleep so we went to watch t.v.\nI had pulled my back at work so even just sitting hurt. Suddenly she screamed \"you could at least fucking touch me!\". We were shoulder to shoulder on the couch. I know pregnancy is hard and emotions are strong, so I ignored the hate in her voice and put my hand on her knee and squeezed and told her I loved her. A few minutes go by and my hand had slipped off. She stood up and smacked me across the face. I was shocked and confused. She walked to the other side of the room, pulled out her cell. To this day I don't know if she actually called the police or not, but she put the phone to her ear and said \" yes police? I'm ---and I'm pregnant and scared and Smallbunyan is hitting me and won't leave my house\". Now I live in Missouri, and her name alone was on the lease. This Did not bode well. So in the wee hours of the morning I left. I slept in the woods and then went to work. I didn't hear from her for a month. Went out for smoke break at work and got a call, it was her! I was excited and all the love came flooding back. Then she told me\"I'm in Kansas and I'm having the baby aborted\". I dropped to the ground and started sobbing. I was broken. Completely fucked up.\n\nBut I say all this just to say; never once was I mad about \"not having a say\". I was Heartbroken, for her going Through it, for  the baby I would never meet. \nI've had people ask me before if I wasn't mad. Fuck no I wasn't mad at her for it. I was upset. But not once was I mad I didn't get a say",

However, because the man should have no say in abortion the women can say, \" I want to have this child\" and the man is then forced to be responsible for a child he didn't want. It seems unfair to me that a parent that doesn't want a child should be responsible for the actions of the other person in any way.

(I feel like \"incubation\" is a terrible word but it's the best one my tiny little brain can come up with atm ) Therefore is 100% her decision if she wants to go through it. However, if she is willing to go through the pregnancy to put the baby up for adoption, the father should really be involved in what happens to the baby if it is born. Especially true if the father is willing to raise it on his own and accepting all the responsibilities of taking care of their unborn child.

You can afford the risk of spontaneity with a little birth control planning, and you really, really, absolutely should know how your partner would react to a birth control failure. \n\nI also always see comments stating that a man should be able to opt out of child support if he wanted the woman to abort. I disagree. Once a child exists, it needs support, and that does not mean that only one parent should have to provide that if there are two or more living parents.\n\nIf a man wants to opt out on child support, he should do everything in his power not to create children and that includes knowing exactly how a sexual partner would handle an unplanned pregnancy before it happens.

              "body": "So, I don't disagree with you. Abortion is a bodily autonomy issue. But this is a complex and emotional topic.\n\nEssentially, speaking for the men that believe the sperm donor should have a say, there are a few realities that are unpleasant which are worth mentioning.\n\n1. The idea that an abortion is the same as murdering an infant complicates everything. Agree or disagree with this idea, it is far from settled in a way that is inarguable. The idea that there is a difference between a fetus and an infant is... Nuanced to say the least. It is not like gravity, which has also been disputed by folks like flat-earthers, in spite of the ease by which this \"theory\" can be explored. If people can argue with gravity, the emotional desperation some folks feel in regards to saving the life of an innocent infant is understandable. That some find no problem in abrogating individual rights of an adult to spare a child from being murdered and dismembered (which is how they see it) is understandable. Even admirable to an extent, were it not motivated by the arrogance such an assumed monopoly on the truth requires.\n\n2. There is a sticky wicket regarding parental rights which is circumstantially unfair. Men can't get pregnant. The day that men CAN get pregnant, abortion laws will get rather interesting I suspect. After all, a woman carrying a child to term becomes an unreasonable way to settle the parental rights of the father and the issue of bodily autonomy of the mother under dispute. A reasonable alternative would be to simply transplant the pregnancy. Currently this is not an option, but termination of the pregnancy is. This is similar to the circumstances of giving up parental rights by putting a child up for adoption.\n\n3. Financial obligation - you mentioned this, but it bares highlighting that historically men have had to deal with this in place of the biological complications that women face while pregnant. Men have the unenviable position of being financially responsible for a situation that they feel is beyond their control or ability to influence. Women too face this issue, but as it is their body, they have the final say on the matter. And unlike women, men require that women agree to give up their parental rights in order to escape this financial obligation in order for this obligation to be transferred to the state. \n\nSo that is why it keeps coming up - because it does actually have an impact on men. Many men have been particularly hurt by the fact that they have been impotent in the face of their own child's murder - at least that is how they would describe the situation in all earnestness. This is understandably traumatic in its own right - and I find little value in comparing the relative impact of traumas of individuals because it all just sucks.\n\nIn my view, the matter is simply complicated, and most men are examining it in the abstract. They have no reason to understand the perspective and experience of women any more than women should be expected to do the same for men. Life is awkward that way, which is why listening is an undervalued skill on both sides.\n\nMuch of this should change once we no longer require women to be incubators for our species. Until then, it's a fairly awkward imbalance that understandably raises a concern that we might be murdering infants as a form of birth control to a rather sizeable portion of the population. We can complain about that, mock them for a lack of understanding of the nuances, or we can simply understand it for what it is.\n\nPeople having complex reactions to complex ideas that are subject to interpretation which is in turn limited by what the interpreter has had the capacity and ability to understand to whatever degree of clarity possible for them. It is unreasonable to expect individuals to exceed their capacity to be reasonable unfortunately.",

Every guy I've had sex with knows kids aren't an option for me. \n\nThe point when men make the decision about having kids is when they decide to have sex without adequate protection. It's their responsibility to be on the same page as their partner. If you can't have a serious conversation about what happens with a whoops, you're not ready to have sex with that person. If you want to keep and raise the kid if birth control fails, you dang well better have that discussion early.\n\nA child isn't something that you incubate for 9 months and then poof. You have to be willing to undergo massive bodily changes, and then follow through for years to raise the kid. I've seen too many guys give lip service to raising a child, separate, then bitch about paying child support. Step up. Do better. The systemic problems (like child care, for which thousands of women are now quitting their jobs to do for free) make having kids an \\_undertaking\\_. \n\nTL;DR Men's decision about abortion happens when he decides who he wants to have sex with.",

I'm not sure how to do that differently but I think it's kind of messed up that it is that way.\"\n\nHonestly; while the topic of abortion is very complicated (and I'm not going to start a debate on it, because that'll only end in war) -why the fuck do some men still jump around this topic?\n\n\"Oh hey. I know that the woman I fucked will carry all responsibilities, health issues, changes for 9months and has to risk her life in a painful labour that could -even today! - kill her, but hey, I just want a kid y'know\"\n\nYou're not discriminated because you can't get a spawn you can ignore for 18years. You don't get a say because you don't have to go through the shit a woman has to go through!\n\nIn general: WHY THE FUCK are some men so eager to fuck with a woman's health?\n\n\"I want a say in abortion\"\n\n\"I want a say if she can get her tubes tied\"\n\n\"I want a say in if she's really sick or just paranoid.\"\n\n\"I know rape's bad, but I don't like the idea of  devices like Rape-aXe, because I think it's still too cruel for the rapist to get his peepee hurt\"(no joke! Had a guy say this in a thread about the thing)\n\n# EDIT 2.0 PLEASE READ THIS SHIT BEFORE YOU SPAM MY INBOX FULL OF THE SAME 3 OPINIONS!\n\nSo, I had a lot of people confide in me, that the reason I have this war in the comments is because I phrased it bad. Which...yes, I see how this happened. Therefore, I made a final re-edited list of all the things I have to say. If you answer anything after that I'm not going to respond anymore. \n\n1.) When I said \"men SHOULD NOT have a say in a woman's abortion!\" I don't mean you can't issue your opinion/ concerns or values as the father of the child/bystander.\n\nWhat I meant was: You cannot & should not be able FORCE a woman to carry your child.  \nWomen already have big problems with wanting their tubes tied, because \"what would your (future) bf/husband say\", or getting rejected from doctors because of sexism (for those stories, just browse the rest of this sub).  \nThey shouldn't also need to collect a form of \"stamp of approval\" before getting one. Y'know, like \"you must have this item to pass the gate\" style.\n\nIf you are in a relationship which is not abusive -of course, talk to your partner. Women have the final say, because they carry most of the burden physically & mentally, but getting an abortion behind your partner's back is still an asshole move.\n\nOn the opposite: You can't force a girl to get an abortion, if she doesn't want to.\n\n2.) On the topic of child support:\n\nI mostly agree that men should be able to walk away from it all, if they don't want to raise a child.  \nThere are commenters who rightfully pointed out that there are places where child support is necessary (aka woman has no access to safe abortions & generally gets screwed over more), but regarding I did this with a...okay, there are also places in the west where women have no access to safe abortions. So let's...ehm...let's rather focus on getting more legal Planned Parenthoods & co.\n\n3.) On the topic of abortion per se:\n\nAs much as I aimed for it with such a title; this is not a place to discuss the ethics of abortion. It always boils down to your personal subjective opinion, your religion and otherwise. Please.\n\n4.) Same goes for meandering topics like military, politics & co.  \nLet's at LEAST keep it on topic.\n\n5.) Though more rare; yes. I KNOW that transmen & nb people can get pregnant too. But please. This is not a \"woke\" debate. It was a rant I had over a guy and I'm not a person that likes to get into meander territory, because I already have a tendency to meander.  \nHowever, same rules apply to you of course.\n\n6.) Guys, these \"if a woman don't want to get pregnant, she just shouldn't have sex\" comments are so bad American sex-ed tapes.  \nWe all know that there is something that can go wrong during sex & pregnancy. Birth control can fail. Sex is not \"just\" for making kids (it's designed for it, but you also don't use a spoon to eat soup, right?), a fetus can become deformed, a woman could have been pressured into sex, doesn't have the recourses...there are a lot of reasons.\n\nOf course, abortion is not a \"quick fix\". And most women don't use it as a \"second birth control\" to \"whore around\" -get this shit out of your system please.  \nHowever, we can all agree that abortions won't stop when make it illegal. We'd only stop SAFE abortions. So let's do the most objectivley progressive thing and try to create better circumstances for young women to get & raise their babies, while also allowing them to terminate them. Call it a \"necessary evil\"if you must.\n\nAnd lastly:\n\n7.)Thanks but...no. I don't \"hate men\".  \nYes, this was a very aggressive rant, but no, I did not \"sexist\" against anyone on purpose (cookie for the user who gets the reference).  \nWith \"You're not discriminated because you can't get a spawn you can ignore for 18years\" I made a reference to all the stories of men that -unintentionally or not - leave child raising mostly to the mother, or think doing the bare minimum makes them a good Dad.   \nThese Dads/ in general; a lot of men often don't see the other side -the side of the mother - and therefore have a bit of an watered-down perspective on pregnancy & labour.  \nStuff like \"it's just 9months\" or \"yeah, labour is bad, but have you ever got a kick into the balls?\" (not opening a pain-olympics here).\n\nAgain: Thank y'all for the awards! I'm very grateful for them! And hope ya all have a nice day!",

You should've talked to us. But you didn't. You've now alienated the men that would come to twox, as well as plenty of the women.

Were we (who liked the way things were) suppose to also make topics on why we liked it the way things were at the time? No, that would've been ridiculous/pointless.\n\nI think you all greatly underestimated the number of people who were perfectly happy with how things are because of complaints from a small group of people. Why try to \"fix\" something that wasn't even broken to begin with?\n\nHonestly, I think the best way to go about things is to remove the new changes for now and open up some sort of dialogue with everyone to figure out if ANY steps need to be taken at all.

Or the Period Scumbag of Henry VIII that's up right now--that's hilarious, clever, and would be banned under the new rules, because it's technically a meme.

The map of a woman's heart from the 1800s would have been banned, too--and it certainly didn't need commentary or a self post, the OP didn't say anything about it. It's just an image, and it stands on its own, because it's interesting and relevant.\n\nI mean, drama-mongering is a good thing to ban, but you're banning SO MANY THINGS at once, and the definition of \"Well it just has to have substance\" is *really* vague.",

I was disappointed, because even though I like reading about the \"serious stuff\", it makes me really angry and depressed a lot of the time, because the \"serious\" women's issues are usually really depressing and rage-inducing.\n\n\nI subscribe to several other feminist subreddits to stay informed about the \"serious stuff\", but I've always loved 2X for providing a place for women to just be women.  People can come here and talk about stuff, or post pictures without enduring the \"why do girls have to be attention whores\" and \"you're fat/ugly/sexy do/don't suck my dick\" comments that are so pervasive elsewhere.  I can find posts about things from a woman's perspective, posts about products and experiences that men wouldn't think to bring up.  Sure there's serious stuff here too, but a lot of it is fun and silly and women need a place to be fun and silly on the internet too.\n\nI think the reason why people are so up in arms, is because they thought you were taking away their fun silly space.  I know you've provided alternative subreddits for some of the pictures and comics, but the tone of their introduction seemed a bit off... sort of like \"we don't want this stuff in here, go elsewhere\" rather than \"this subreddit is getting very large, to allow us to moderate more effectively we've broken things up into 2X run several subreddits\"\n\n\nAnyways, sorry this turned out to be a bit longer than I intended.

I like the boyfriend post; I think its cute. I like to see the silly or cute faces/things they do. It's just as comforting or amusing as a romantic/romantic comedy movie might be, but quick and simple. I also like to see that the community I'm involved in everyday on the internet has faces and is in fact actually human and living. I like the engagement ring pictures. They make me smile and think about the future. I like the stories about how it happened that might be behind them. I like the rainbow cakes or the failed rainbow cakes. It's something we're proud of or something to laugh about and plenty of people were inspired to take a stab at the things like rainbow cakes that they found on 2X. I don't like to cook enough to subscribe to any of the cooking subs and the same goes for other random things like that found in 2X but I have been inspired here to do things I might not normally do or ever think about. This is a place where women come to talk to each other and be exposed to things that other women do and are proud of. \n\nI come here to be inspired, and not just as a woman but by women. I come here for advice. I come here for support. I come here for a laugh. I come here for a cry. I come here for an experience unlike any other place on the internet that I've found. What's wrong with that? Why do you have to break up the community and shuffle us into other sections of the internet? Why not make a new subreddit with your rules rather than break up one that is thriving? Because its hard to start a new one. Its hard to get the same attention. Its hard to stay active. I don't like having to go to other subs to get the same content that I could in the sub that originally exposed me to it. I also don't want that content to fade because there aren't enough people to actively participate in it. \n\nI appreciate that the other subs are there but I don't personally visit them unless I'm looking for something specific. I like that after reading an emotional and/or serious post, the next post might be a rage comic that will make me giggle. I like the serious and light hearted, the simple and the complicated all in one place. ",

You would be able to gauge very accurately what it is that 2X readers enjoy and dislike about 2X, and then use those results publicly to establish what would make the majority feel is an improvement. \n\nI think one of the reasons this is going over so badly is because for most of us, it seems sudden and unnecessary. I didn't see a lot of complaints being made publicly, and anything that goes on behind the scenes in PMs or what have you is unavailable to us, so it just seems bizarre to suddenly change something that was seemingly fine. \n\nI know and understand wanting to improve content, no one can fault you for that. But if the content that is already here is what the majority like, then the improvement isn't going to be received well. I think a survey would help you guys determine what is wanted way more so than PMed complaints and lynch mobs.\n\nGood luck.",

In this case, people who find jokes that maybe require you to have some knowledge of history funny. It's also referencing the numerous posts that say \"scumbag period.\" Get it? Period scumbag. It's reversed!

It was actually a funny(maybe slightly intellectual?) joke, which started a conversation about history and politics. You didn't get it. That's fine. That doesn't mean it shouldn't be allowed.

This feels incredibly callous and these rules would have really, really benefitted from some softening by community discussion. Now I am afraid that you have polarized the community and it will be very difficult to have an open discussion without people picking sides and getting their panties in a twist. \n\nI would also like a mod to respond to what has been mentioned in a few posts, /r/femmit 's recent creation and its influence on these changes. I might think it was only coincidence, but I notice it's not mentioned in the side-bar and can't help thinking that's because the changes in 2xc are meant to make femmit irrelevant. In my personal opinion, 2xc should not be femmit, and there should be a way to mediate some of these changes which seem legitimate, like less memes and 'lookbook' posts, with still allowing links to things like pinterest, self posts that are a bit rambling, and links to images. \n\nI really hope everyone can calm down for a minute, stop calling people karmawhores, and listen to one another. \n\n",

Promoting your FABULOUS new subreddit is, of course, always welcome.\n\n>No questions generalizing all people from one group\n\n>>We will no longer allow \"friendzone\" questions or \"Dude here; Why do all women.. Why won't she... Why do females\" posts that blanket categorize people. Those posts are welcome in the [relationship community,](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships+dating_advice+breakups+ihaveissues+relationship_tips/new) [relationship_advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/) and /r/AskWomen\n\n>All posts must be focused on women or being a woman.\n\n>>side note to this rule: We're coming into an election year, political posts are going to abound. Posts from major media sources with the bulk of the article focused on a candidates stance on women's issues are allowed. Blogs, self posts about why Johnny Appleseed is the bestest (or worstest) candidate for women, articles that mention abortion in passing, or direct links to donation pages should be posted elsewhere. \n\n>**Posts found to have an influx from ***any*** group of users may  result in those users banned, en masse, at our discretion.\n\n>>Users who wish to appeal may do so. Consideration will be given to otherwise positive members of 2xc ***regardless*** of other subreddits they are involved in. Throwaway accounts will not be given any consideration.  User history will also be taken into consideration. Differing opinions are welcome, voting and participating in threads as an organized group is not.\n\n\nETA: To be clear, we absolutely are not trying to get rid of throwaway accounts used by users with secrets to share or in need of support. I've moved a few sentences to hopefully make that clearer. Throwaway accounts used to troll or participate in a thread in an organized fashion with outsides groups will not be given any consideration when banned. \n\nSecond ETA: We still want silly posts, we still welcome self posts with fun/silly questions, silly articles about whatever affects *your* life are all still welcome! Only if your post has a political slant, you must do it from a woman's perspective.  \n",

I did express that I'm having my disappointment and initial anger, but I know I'm on the right path that as I soaked this in, the most important thing is being a trusted person in a horrible time in her life.  Like I said, I told her \"Well get through this together\" is my focus aside from my feelings.  I also did tell her that I did need to work through my own initial feelings, and wrote that after a four hour ordeal with that news while breaking down, getting towed and a taxi.... but the ultimate goal is making sure she can cope. \n\nI thank you all for your points of view and advice... extremely helpful.  Definitely helps me keep in perspective this really is about her and nothing and nobody else, and to do what's best and right for her. \n\nDefinitely, as some have suggested, this certainly presents an opportunity in finding a reliable method of BC that works with her hormones.  Hopefully she's open to the thought of an IUD but we shall see.\n\nThank you, again!",

We had a very good talk today about the situation and I feel she's making the right decisions for the right reasons for herself.  We decided for her to come to where I reside, as it will be extremely discrete for her to say \"Going to visit Mom a few days\" versus why I made a surprise visit to a very small town.  Also it will be more comfortable to have her in my home, versus staying in a cramped and musty hotel room. (Slim pickings in a rural area) and me having a very short limited stay, where as in my home doors always open and she can leave when she's ready to travel.\n\nThe other advantage to her staying with me a few days is she can focus on her recovery without having to pretend nothing is wrong as she lives with her boyfriend and his parents...as they are not aware of the situation. And we can have some quality alone time.  \n\nWas funny, after the divorce I was only making $10.00 and living in NJ (Housing and rent is expensive) and while we were discussing that she's barely able to support herself on her income, that I know the hardship of having 3 kids under the age of 5 and only having $35.00 for an entire weekend, with one in diapers.   She laughed and said \"is that why we ate so many hot dogs with scrambled eggs slathered in purple ketchup and baby carrots? I told her yep... I put on my best game face on while I was completely trying to keep it together. \n\nSo she knows on my end, right now I'm talking to her from the heart and don't want to see her needlessly suffer in an already difficult situation along to how unfair that would be to a child. \n\nThe only thing to do now is for her to make the appointment...",

Probably channeling it into helping her get hooked up with reliable birth control is a good idea.\n\nThe amount of judgement, blame and outrage society has programmed her to expect is probably already quite enough to be dealing with when you need to go get a medical procedure done, don't you agree?",

              "body": "****TL;DR: I just found out my adult teenage daughter is pregnant, though I told her to always use protection.  I'm angry, disappointed, though being supportive as much as I can be and she wants me to be with her during the procedure. She's opting for an abortion and just grateful to come across this Sub because it's now a default. ****\n\nWow.  Okay.. I've had a very long evening which included at the time my 1999 vehicle was starting to crap out, my 19 year old daughter called me in hysterics.  As in the past, the first question is \"are you pregnant\".  This time she said \"Mom.....\" I pulled over because car was crapping out, and now I was crapping pants.    \n\nYep.  She is.  Saw this one coming as she confided in me that she and her boyfriend on occasion use the withdrawal method.  Time and time again I have told her.. that is NOT a form of birth control but playing 'when am I going to get pregnant' Russian roulette. \n\nShe said that as soon as the clinic confirmed she is positive for pregnancy, she freaked out knowing \"I'm not ready to have a kid right now\".   I don't know her boyfriends stance, other than during the second call to her tonight, he apologized.  As a parent, and he knows I'm not really into him based on horrible first impressions, that saying sorry and now being partially responsible for this situation that could have been avoided by using condoms.... <sigh>.  To be honest, I don't care about what he thinks or feels. I'm only in this for doing what is best for my daughter and getting her through this.  If they break up over this, I have a second bedroom ready for her. \n\nI think we are all in agreement that abortion is the best, and right choice for her at this point in her life, where she's barely supporting herself.\n\nShe also knows from me being a long distant parent, missing out on much of her life and her siblings, and having a horrible relationship with their father, that's part of the package as (and this is where we disagree) he's not father material.\n\nThough I didn't exactly give my three kids up for adoption, they have grown up without me being a direct part of their lives, and I can personally share being an absent mother is painful.  But at the time of the divorce, I made, what I felt was in the best interests for my children considering the difficult situation I was in at that time of the divorce, and some very difficult decisions (like moving out of state) after the divorce. \n\nReading all of these comments is reassuring to me, and I wouldn't have found this thread if it wasn't for all the posts about how this is a default. \n\nI'll be coordinating with my daughter tomorrow as how we'll plan this out, as we're 300 miles apart.  So I either go up north to her and will be with her for the procedure, or she can come down here and spend a few days with me and do the procedure here. We are in different states so part of the decision or conversation will be comparing notes and availability. Personally, I'd love for her to come here to be a bit removed from the situation and protect her from any issues for a day or so she can get some emotional bearings back.  We'll see, I suppose. \n\nBut I wanted to thank OP for this post because as a mother who saw this coming a mile away, how grateful I am that my daughter had enough trust in me, knowing I \"told her so\" but aside from my initial \"WTF\" reaction knowing that my more calm reaction was that \"we'll get through this together.  This is the right decision for you right now, and doesn't mean you can't have a family when you are in a better situation. If you want a family, you'll have one, but now is not the time.\"  Mind you this bomb dropped on me is only about 6 hours old...\n\nOn the flip side, my boyfriend of nearly 11 years, one time he did get a girlfriend pregnant and he's always made it clear he never wants children....and basically he set everything up for the abortion with that girlfriend, and for them, post abortion the relationship died.  However, that was the right decision for him.  Even though he's my confidant and best friend, and being a parent, he definitely would have made a real shitty father, especially when this happened 20 years ago. \n\nI also did my best to explain to her that this is a hard decision and as a Mother I'm so confused, emotionally, that part of me is infuriated, disappointed, but as I said, I'll help her get through this.  If anyone has any advice as a mother to support her daughter, please feel free to share. \n\n",

The reality is you discussed what would happen in the event of pregnancy. It's not like he was blindsided by your views, yet you were definitely blindsided by his. It's obvious that he's kept his views on abortion secret from you for a reason. What else is he hiding (yeah, yeah, you can all hate me for planting a seed of doubt)? \n\nIt sounds cliched, but you need to do what you need to do to keep on living happily. If you're doubting having a baby at this point in time, then guess what... IT'S NOT THE RIGHT FUCKING TIME! \n\nYou need to really discuss this with him before your appointment. It doesn't matter how you look at it, this point in time is going to be the biggest strain on your relationship, and if you can't sit down and talk about it rationally, then your relationship is fucking doomed, no matter how much either of you love each other. Bringing a baby into this world to save a relationship is fucked up. Him giving you an ultimatum to either have the baby or break up is even more fucked up and is ridiculously manipulative, emotional blackmail. \n\nThese forums are about opinions, I realise this, so don't hate me too much for this, but I honestly don't think your relationship will survive this. He's thrown down the gauntlet so to speak with his ultimatum without giving you any recourse, or support, and right now is when you need support the most. If you decide to go through with the pregnancy what happens when he decides he doesn't want to change diapers? When he doesn't want to stay at home for the 10th weekend in a row because you have a newborn baby? \n\nYeah, I'm an asshole, I get this, but you've made a decision to have the abortion. The deciding factor in your relationship will be if he decides to go with you to the clinic without trying to guilt you the whole way, or not. If he chooses to abandon you (it's a shitty choice of words but it's the right choice) when you go to the clinic, it's over. Pure and simple. Find someone you trust to go with you for support. Hell, if I'm anywhere nearby you, I'll go with you if you have nobody else. I'm sure there's a 1000 other non-judgmental people on Reddit that will go with you too if you need the support.\n\nTL:DR - No one, and no one, has the right to issue ultimatums in a relationship and make you feel like shit. Your boyfriend sounds like a total fucktard. \n\nAs a finishing note, I don't know you. No one here does, but there are plenty of people here who have been in your shoes. Respect yourself enough to know that this guy is not respecting your feelings at all is trying to guilt you into something you're not ready for. That is not the sign of a healthy relationship no matter how much of a good guy you make him out to be. \n\nNow, go out there, do what is right for YOU at this point in YOUR life, and go kick some ass, no matter which direction this decision takes you.",

The man is never the one who gets pregnant. Therefore the man has no saying, whether he wants an abortion or not. Even though, that the child would also be his.\n\nTherefore I always made sure to not have a sexual relationship before asking the partner about abortion - if she considers it, I won't sleep with her.

What I meant was that, as it was presented, the original discussion seemed ultimatum-y (\"Keep the kid or lose me\") and, ultimatums being a form of manipulation and not helpful, I was not sure his opinion (as a manipulator) should be taken as valid. I'm willing to concede that this may have been my misinterpretation. I also agree with your point that she should have as much information as possible when making the final decision, including the effect on their relationship.\n\n> Another small point I find worth making is that you are assuming that when she has the baby, \"all other parts of life for her will lose meaning\" for her.\n\nI will concede that this may have been dramatic (it's a fault). What I was attempting to express is that, if she chose to have the child, there would be real practical limitations put on her current set of goals, an assumption I'm operating on because she seems to be as well. Given that, the assumption is that having the child will somehow make up for that, implying her current goals (which she has expressed are important to her) are less important to their overall happiness than his interest in this child. It's a matter of priorities. If you're a good parent I believe your goals have to, to a certain extent, take a backseat to the well being of your child, and my point was you better be damn willing to make that choice, and that no one should force you into it. \n\n> You said, \"people in stressful situations need reassurance of what they've done well..\"\n\nThe second half of that sentence, \" as well as criticism of what they haven't,\" is of monumental importance to the overall meaning. That said, criticism by itself will put people on the defensive, which generally makes them more reactive and less mindful. I didn't, at the time, judge that to be a helpful path to take. \n\n>  It sounded like you were basically telling her that respecting her boyfriends feeling were a nice albeit unnecessary touch.\n\nIf that's how it read then I expressed it badly.\n\n>  Because suddenly he doesn't have a chance at being mature, because ultimately it isn't his decision, and if he isn't making a decision then he isn't being mature(by your definition of mature). \n\nAhh, but he is making a decision. Being honest about your feelings doesn't preclude tact. If she is feeling upset enough to ask internet strangers for advice, then I am willing to wager she is feeling emotionally abandoned--a situation he created with the way he expressed his feelings. This IS stressful for him too, and he SHOULD express how he feels about it, but there is no need to make her feel worse about it. Look at the language:\n\n>  he said he felt like I was rejecting a piece of him and abandoning a child-our child. \n\n>  if I abort he's not sure if we can stay together.\n\nThe alternatives to these statements, in my head, look something like: \"I see a future where we are married, have children and are happy, and I see no reason we shouldn't go for that now.\" \"I'm not sure I support your decision as you have laid it out, maybe we should talk to someone about it.\" I think the way he expressed himself denotes a selfish attitude, rather than a willingness to compromise, and compromise is the cornerstone of a strong relationship. It might be that this is a deal breaker for him, and if that's the case then the relationship likely won't work, but he should be supportive of her in the immediate either way, if only because regardless of the outcome, she's got basically all of the immediate hardship.\n\n> He let her explain her reasons for making her choice to abort, told her how he feels, told her that it may end the relationship, and he told her he needs time to decide whether or not he wants to come with her(and while I would come with for support, if he has a moral objection to abortion I can understand his reasons for not wanting to come.\n\nSee, I can't understand it. If the outcome of the pregnancy is a birth, he's there in full, but if it's a termination she's on her own? Does his moral objection to abortion absolve him of the implicit responsibility of having sex? What if he had a moral objection to parenthood?\n\n> My point is, your definition of maturity was unfair and lead to what you wanted the outcome to be.\n\nI stand by my assertion that maturity is the ability to be aware of your self in the context of your impact on others and the world around you, and being willing to deal with the consequences. Perhaps including the word 'decision' in that definition narrowed the scope too far, but it was intended as a single application of a more general rule, which I may not have expressed well.\n",

However, I still have some major issues with your first comment. \rTo start, you said she doesn't even really need to consider his opinion. Which, I find to not be true. I think it is a good idea for her to know how it will effect everyone involved, and as you stated...they were both involved. Which is why when you say she believe it puts pressure on her to keep the child... I can't really disagree. It probably does put pressure on her to keep the child, and it should. Not in the sense that her reasons aren't important or his are more important, but in the sense that she should have all the information, and his feelings make up a portion of the information.\rAnother small point I find worth making is that you are assuming that when she has the baby, \"all other parts of life for her will lose meaning\" for her. That is a large assumption to make... While, I am sure this does happen I believe it is within the realm of possibility that this wouldn't happen, and that it may not be what he wants. There is a chance he could be a stay at home dad(though chances are he wouldn't be), and there is another chance they they both continue doing what they do, but with the added responsibility of a child. Now, if the latter is the case I can't damn her for not wanting the added responsibility. I myself do not want to be a father or have any of the added responsibilities that come with, but I think it is sill y to assume her life would lose meaning outside of being a mother. \rYou said, \"people in stressful situations need reassurance of what they've done well..\" And while I agree(with some disagreement(someone can be doing bad while doing some things right)), that didn't sound like what you were saying. It sounded like you were basically telling  her that respecting her boyfriends feeling were a nice albeit unnecessary touch.\rFinally, \"...and resentment does not a happy relationship make...\", I agree 100%. This post is about her decision, but it is also about her boyfriend's reaction and how to handle it. I do not think it is immature for him to be upset if she decides to terminate the pregnancy. While it is her choice, it will effect him. And if down the line he resents her choice and it eventually leads to a break up, I think it is better for her to know then for her to be blind sided(a point you made about maturity) by it.\rOne final point... I disagree with your definition of immaturity/maturity immensely. While an immature/mature person might act in a manner as you've described,it isn't right to say mature people make decisions with knowledge of how they affect others. That definition stacks the deck. Because suddenly he doesn't have a chance at being mature, because ultimately it isn't his decision, and if he isn't making a decision then he isn't being mature(by your definition of mature). I think his actions clearly demonstrate his maturity despite him not making the decision. He let her explain her reasons for making her choice to abort, told her how he feels, told her that it may end the relationship, and he told her he needs time to decide whether or not he wants to come with her(and while I would come with for support, if he has a moral objection to abortion I can understand his reasons for not wanting to come. And to be clear, I'm not saying she is acting immaturely. Because she clearly is. My point is, your definition of maturity was unfair and lead to what you wanted the outcome to be. \r",

                          "body": "So, I'm going to preface this with I don't know the guy and I don't know this woman, and the situation is probably more complex than a couple of paragraphs on the internet can properly express. The things I'm operating on, information wise:\n\n* She's pregnant\n* She doesn't feel ready to be a parent\n* He does feel ready to be a parent\n* He objects to the termination of the pregnancy\n* He says would feel betrayed if she aborts, and likely wouldn't continue the relationship\n* She feels this is putting pressure on her to carry to term a child she is apprehensive (at best) about having\n* She feels that having a baby now would jeopardize her future and/or her ability to be a good parent\n\nThe conclusion I've drawn from these things is that while she is envisioning immediate parenthood as the end of her ambitions and a major life change, he is envisioning a future where everyone is a happy family of the two of them (married) and with at least one child. If you deny my assumption, I understand, but I have trouble imagining that he's asking her to keep this pregnancy so that he can eventually take total custody and be a single father, and that's the root of why I believe he is acting immaturely. He's envisioning that she will have this child and that, suddenly, all other parts of life for her will lose meaning, and nothing other than being a happy family will matter any more. While that's possible (I suppose) it seems exceedingly unlikely. People being people, I find it more likely that, if she were to keep the pregnancy, there would always be doubt about that decision and longing for the life/career/satisfaction that she sees herself obtaining if she continues down her current path. Doubt and longing lead to resentment, and resentment does not a happy relationship make. I suppose it's possible that my assumptions are dead wrong, but people are rarely as complex as they think they are, and the alternatives are pretty unlikely unless some pretty complex stuff is going on for one, or the other, or both of them, mentally. My point is that he's not thinking through the implications of the decision, or even past the emotional weight of the decision, and, given the consequences, that's not very mature.\n\nAs far as the internet kudos part, is it really that out of line to give someone credit for doing the right thing? It's a sad world that only derides people who do wrong, and never congratulates people for being good, or noble, or even just considerate. Besides, can it really hurt at all? It is a discussion that both parties to the pregnancy should have, I agree with you, but there seems to be a way of thinking that says that once the woman is pregnant, the decision is entirely up to her as to whether or not to keep it, and that the man should step up if decides to do so, regardless of his feelings. I'm NOT saying that a man should be able to make a woman terminate a pregnancy. I AM saying that it's a complex issue that deserves the opinions of both parties. Frankly, if I can help someone else arrive at the conclusion that they shouldn't approach that decision without consulting their SO (assuming a healthy relationship) by giving a pat on the back with a few keystrokes that travel through the internet, then I am absolutely going to do so. Besides, people in stressful situations need reassurance of what they've done well in order to make good decisions, as well as criticism of what they haven't. The take-away here is that words have impact, and I was trying to have a positive one.\n\nYou are obviously free to disagree with me and my opinions and/or my assumptions, but I still don't think it does any good to be bitter or derisive (which is the opposite of what I was aiming for, not what I think you're doing), and I stand by my evaluation of him as being immature. Maturity is about being able to see through the implications of your decisions and the impact they will have on others and the world around you, and being willing to deal with the bad that comes with the good. Immaturity is idealizing a single outcome to the point where no other ones occur to you, and you end up blindsided by problems you should have seen coming a mile away.\n\nAgain, that's what my experience has taught me, and, therefore, just my opinion.\n\n\n**EDIT**:formatting.",

              "body": "Since you have now said this a couple of times, I just want to make sure to dispel the myth: With the exception of one class of antibiotic (Rifampin) that is used to treat tuberculosis, antibiotics do not have any proven effect on oral contraceptive effectiveness. But don't take my word on it, here are some sources:\n\nhttp://shs.osu.edu/blog/the-truth-about-antibiotics-and-birth-control1\n\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/birth-control/in-depth/birth-control-pill/art-20045136?pg=2 (last quesiton on page)\n\nhttp://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/ask-dr-cullins/dr-cullins-birth-control-5444.htm\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12436822\n\nPart of the reason that this myth has persisted is that more protection can't possibly be harmful, and a condom is never not a good idea. That said, as a man that has had his heart in his throat as an overly paranoid girlfriend took a pregnancy test from three counties away, absolutely sure she was pregnant... well you get the picture.\n\nWhile it may not be a comfort, you are a statistical anomaly. The bright side is that you may not have done anything wrong, meaning you have no reason to feel stupid or guilty, just unlucky on your roll of the dice.\n\nNow, on to the emotional part: Sorry for the above, I don't mean to belittle your situation and I hope you don't take it that way. Personally, I think you're doing the right thing, but probably for a different reason than other people here. Your boyfriend's reaction in both the original and this updated discussion doesn't reveal someone with the emotional maturity to be a parent. The idea that you can introduce a child into a relationship that both parties in that relationship don't equally want and have a healthy relationship at the same time is facile. Early parenthood has been shown over and over again to be one of the most stressful times in a relationship: You're sleep deprived, you're subject to a whole new set of limits that are outside of your control and have a huge impact on your day to day life, and you have a new person in your life that is completely dependent on you and your SO for everything--this is a trying time even if you're fully committed to each other and the kid. Whether or not to terminate this pregnancy is very likely not the hardest decision you'll face as a couple and the idea that forcing one or the other of you into the situation of caring for an unwanted child will lead to a good relationship is faulty logic at best. You're absolutely correct to have concerns about becoming a parent as it is a lifelong commitment that cannot be taken back. Ever. And that's a pretty big deal.\n\nAlso, I want to give you some internet kudos for taking his feelings into account. Given his behaviour I'm not sure his opinion should be considered material, but you're a good person to extend him that courtesy. I've seen a lot of sentiment of, \"it's your body, it's your decision,\" and while that's functionally true, it fails to take into account the emotional reality, viz. you love this guy and you were both part of creating this situation. You're in a committed relationship. You plan on getting married. Just because you have different feelings in this admittedly difficult situation doesn't reduce the guy to the level of sperm donor. Your intentions of involving him in the decision are entirely admirable and reveal a maturity that you may not be confident that you have. Him putting you in a situation where you feel you have to choose between your life and your relationship is an incredibly shitty thing to do (like, monumentally shitty), and not something that I believe someone who is ready to be a parent would do. I read on here (reddit, not 2X) at some point that relationships work best when both parties believe the give and take is 60/40. That means you both give a little more than half of yourself to the other person--not enough that you resent them, even if they don't return it right away, but enough that they know you are doing it. The harsh truth is that he's seemingly unwilling to work past his ideological problems to make sure that you remain happy, and that's no good. Sacrifice isn't sacrifice if it's easy, and you should be worth more to him than that. As I tried to articulate above, forcing you to have the kid doesn't make any rational sense either.\n\nOne final thing: Your dedication to your relationship is admirable, and if you're seeking to continue it you should not feel guilty about asking him to come with you to your appointment. Ideally his feelings for you and his desire for your well being should override his discomfort. Perhaps if he sees what a physical sacrifice this is for you, that you couldn't have come to this decision at the drop of a hat and that it was likely more difficult for you then he is giving it credit, perhaps that will cause him to mature. I'm not saying to count on it, but if he won't even come out of his comfort zone to make sure you're healthy, then you're probably not losing the love of your life anyway.\n\nBut, that's just, like, my opinion man (all except the top part, that's science).

I'm not here to give you either but just give you an objective view. \n\nYou seem like a very mature individual and you put a lot of thought into this and I applaud you. You are probably getting a huge influx of emotions. You can probably gauge this by how you felt the moment you found out you were pregnant. That being said, I would recommend talking to your closest allies, maybe family, maybe friends, maybe a close neighbor. This will help expand your thinking process because the danger her is isolation and thinking can stray in those situations. \n\nOnce you have this firm grounding, I would recommend taking your thinking outside of the box one more step. Try to separate yourself from the societal paradigm that if you were to have this child you have to be his/her mother. You don't. Would it be tough to give up the child? Absolutely. But explore this possibility for a moment and think, would I be happier or less happy to see this child first learn to talk, first ride a bike, graduate from college, star a family of his/her own, or just doesn't exist and in that existentially perishes in that sense. \n\nOne could go on about the emotional and moral pros and cons of either choice, but the most important thing is that you think outside the paradigm trap that if you have bear the child you will be miserable for 9 months and then dread each day giving him/her up. There are couples out there who pay for literally all of the mother's needs (food, clothing, housing) and then the delivery, and also give the birth mother visiting/caring rights. It certainly could be a viable option to think about. \n\nEdit: I think it's important to explore all the options, talk to close family and friends, and understand the adoption perspective fully, and if that gets down voted to the bottom of this thread, OK then. I just really care about the OP because my cousin was in a similar situation and made a decision in haste that she regrets 6 1/2 years later. ",

This is one of the reasons for why I cannot really talk to the OP and be informed about what she is experiencing in this situation. But I wasn't talking to her, I was talking to you, and specifically I was addressing a specific statement you made. And, later, pointing out that the topic of a discussion in a subthread of a thread can transition from the original topic. Which is what happened.\n\n> I can only assume that you are very young and without relevant life experience, caring more about your individual rights then that of a person in need reaching out and asking for help.\n\nYour are very incorrect here. But this is not really relevant, because I am not claiming to be informed about OP's position here.\n\nAnd I did not say one word about \"my individual rights.\" How do my rights even come into the picture? Rights to post on an anonymous Internet forum about a discussion disconnected from the thread as a whole?.. Is that an individual right you feel I am defending right now? Or what are you referring to?\n\n> It doesn't matter if it is online or not, unless you are a robot and not a human being, of course.\n\nI think having a certain filter when experiencing **anonymous** (that's the key here, as I see it, not that it's online or not) communication is healthy and reasonable.\n\nYou are not being very direct, but if I am understanding you correctly, you are saying that \"Because you choose not to try and assist the OP, and instead are talking to me in her thread about a disconnected topic, you do not care about her feelings\". This is illogical, if that's what you are implying. My reasons for not talking to her (outside of a couple words about a specific phrase I think, to which she very politely and reasonably responded and thanked me for) have nothing to do with caring or not caring about her.\n\n> I am done with you, feel free to keep beating your chest though, in another thread.\n\nWhat?",

Which is why telling me that being helpful or supportive doesn't matter much to me is a bit odd - of course it doesn't, when talking to you, for the same reasons that being helpful to me and supporting me doesn't matter to you. Nor should it.\n\n> I do believe you are having a nervous breakdown in someone elses thread. \n\nEh... do you have *any* idea about what a nervous breakdown actually is? Having any kind of emotions, much less strong ones, when talking anonymously in an Internet forum, is completely laughable. And telling someone that they have such emotions because they are disagreeing with you in an Internet forum is a complete non sequitur.\n\nIt would be like me telling you that you are about to cry or give birth or something. I have no reason to believe anything of the sort, and you have no reason to think that I have any kind of emotion about this discussion.\n\nOne thing though... In Internet forums in general, and in this subreddit in particular, threads do not actually *belong* to their OPs. It's just a place to talk. There are absolutely no rules, written, unwritten or implied, that state that a discussion in a thread about, let's say, cars, cannot transition to computational fluid dynamics or feminism. So it is laughable to suggest that \"It is of poor taste, or not allowed, to talk about _X_ in a thread that was originally about _Y_.\"\n\n> I am gently suggesting you woman up and be supportive as the OP wants \"help\" if you re-read the title it says \"help\". \n\nWell, first, I am a dude, but that's not really relevant.

As you've involved him in making the decision and actually talked with him about it at length, he will probably come around to accept it in time. He won't like it, but he'll accept it and respect your choice. \n\nWhether he is willing to go with you to the clinic is very much a symptom of this acceptance. If he has fully come around to it, he'll probably come, both as proof to himself that he has and to support you. If he hasn't, then he may not or he might force himself to in support for you. And if he doesn't come, then that means he's probably just too conflicted to really make a decision right now. But I imagine he'll probably come around.\n\nAs for asking him to go with you, I suppose if I were really mad I could perceive that as cruel, but after a while I think I'd realize that you're just scared about this and need someone you trust to be there with you. So no, it's not cruel, on the contrary, it shows a great deal of trust in his good nature. The fact that he said he'd think about it (and didn't just blow up in anger) shows that he realizes where you're coming from, which is a very good thing.\n\nHope this all turns out alright for you.

We ended up having an hour long conversation where I told him honestly that I didn't think I could be a parent today-some day in the future (with him hopefully) but now I was not equipped. I asked him for his feelings and he said he felt like I was rejecting a piece of him and abandoning a child-our child. (Which honestly made me feel very guilty. Not guilty enough to justify bringing a child into the world though.)\n\n\n\nI told him I felt differently but that his feelings were valid. But I decided to get the abortion because I'm just not ready to be a mother now. I hope to be someday, and I don't want to have a child before I can devote myself entirely to it. He said he sort of understood but still felt as though we were abandoning a child. I apologized to him. \n\n\n\nI asked him again if he could go with me to the clinic because (I know it's selfish) I really want someone I know well with me. He said he'd think about it and get back to me. I made an appointment for next week. \n\n\n\nSo I'm not sure where our relationship will go from here. He still hates the idea of abortion but I think he hates it a little less now. I'll have to see how he feels afterwards. \n\n\n\nI'm really glad I made the appointment though because the thought of being a mother scares me even more than him leaving, although that's a really hard choice to make.

People, especially POC and LGBT+ groups at greater risk, did their best to point out how biden's stated goals were to simply continue the intended status quo and do as little as possible to change or fix things. Cue a tidal wave of middle, upper middle, class white people chanting \"Blue no matter who\" or \"a vote for anyone but biden is a vote for trump!\" and swinging that shit like a cudgel against progressive voices to silence them just so they could be comfortable knowing they voted for the lesser of two evil old racist child predators.\n\nThe american democratic party fights progressive voices, even within its own party, harder than it fights the regressive right and it's fucked up. And yet rather than trying to empower anyone else the people hit hardest by this regime that has allowed shit to slide this far are told to shut up and stand in line with everyone else and not to be too angry that they haven't been listened to or get continually talked over when they've been right time after time.\n\nOP, I understand how much you want to not be seen as \"an angry black woman\" but if there's any time to be angry, and justification to be angry, it's shit like this. Shit like all of this. Your voice should be heard, and people should be listening. And fuck anyone who wouldn't just because they'd rather dismiss you as a stereotype.",

I especially hate the hypocrisy of the privileged who virtue signal their woke values but then enact policies to keep them and theirs \u201csafe\u201d from the undesirables in society. \n\nBut I\u2019m not going to let hypocrisy splinter those that are willing to fight for my rights. This isn\u2019t virtue signaling. Women are actually about to lose the right to their own body. All women. I\u2019m not going to let my anger bring even more division when I have so many ways the world is working against me.\n\n(You edited your comment so maybe this doesn\u2019t make sense anymore but I\u2019ll just leave it)",

At the heart of almost every great rights movement - whether it's for civil rights, queer rights or women's rights - have been black women risking themselves and speaking powerfully for their right to exist and right to autonomy. And as soon as there's ever any traction gained white women are quick to tell those women to shut up, sit at the back of the bus and not make a fuss and take full credit for everything done - and in the worst situations even retroactively try and paint the black women as being lesser than they were.\n\nWe, for example, have it on historical record that Sojourner Truth's famous speech, when retold by white women, was dumbed down and made to sound more ignorant and unintelligent. Race, class and political activism have always had a nasty, and often hidden, history of wealthy white people stomping in, taking credit and shunting off the lower classes who did the hard work getting everything to the comfortable spot where the rich and politically apathetic feel like they can take over.",

Nobody was talking about when politicians were trying to repeal the Indian Child Welfare act. The POINT of mentioning these things is that woc have been fighting for so long with no help from White women and now that abortion rights are in jeopardy White women want everyone to come together.  The reason for talking about this now is for people, specifically White women, to do some introspection and actually join the fight in meaningful ways.\n\nNo one is saying you shouldn't be angry or scared, but to actually take action outside of just voting.

Yet so many people in these comments took it as a personal attack. \n\nForever minorities have been fighting for the right to do with what they want with their body. Look at trans folks for example, so many of them get told that they can\u2019t remove a part of their reproduction system for whatever reason and so many people think they\u2019re mentally ill. But when a women wants to remove her uterus because maybe she doesn\u2019t want kids or periods, then yes she should be able to do that. Wasn\u2019t it black trans women who started the pride movement but it\u2019s now movements are usually led by white folks and gay culture is very white. \n\nSo many people here were acting as if you was creating a divide but the divide has been here forever. Or someone in the comments said this isn\u2019t helpful, the rant wasn\u2019t really supposed to be helpful, if the post in these subreddit are supposed to be helpful, shouldn\u2019t we be getting rid of the posts ranting about men? When white women post on here everyone knows she isn\u2019t talking about all men. Or some people saying that this is wrong place to the post this, like if you\u2019re women shouldn\u2019t you be able to post anything here like everyone else does?",

Is the pill a method that requires earlier use? It's obviously less invasive, which is a major plus. How is the process of getting it? Does planned parenthood do that type of thing? Sorry if I come across as ignorant, she and I are both pretty anxious. ",

Everyone's experiences are different. I don't feel like I can personally relate at all to this woman's experience, and parts of the video/her situation actually make me feel extremely uncomfortable, but whatever. That's her experience. I'm glad she feels okay about it. \n\nIt's not like I wish that anyone would feel as conflicted as I do about their abortion. I don't think there's any \"good\" or \"bad\" way to feel about it. I am not going to judge anyone for not having a difficult time and I'm certainly not someone who thinks that abortion should be banned because of my personal experience. I'm still pro-choice. But having a difficult time, either emotionally or physically or both is definitely within the realm of possibilities when you choose to have an abortion. Having no emotional or physical issues whatsoever is also within the realm of possibility. And both of those are okay to feel and to talk about.\n\nI did notice something that's sort of interesting from reading the comments here and from our convo - it seems like the people who don't feel guilty feel like there's some pressure to feel guilty, and those who do feel guilty feel like there's some pressure to not feel guilty :) Funny, huh?

The production of hormones from the placenta is a good mark, since you can easily confirm it, and it \"makes sense\", in the lack of a better definition by me, but it's still just a point defined by us. \n\nBy [here](/http://miscarriage.about.com/od/riskfactors/a/miscarriage-statistics.htm), 22% of conceptions fail implantation, while around 50% of properly said pregnancies miscarry, so we can't even say it's because the chances of a successful birth increases after implantation.\n\nAbout what you said first, surely, the gametes have a whopping 0% of resulting in a baby by themselves, but contraceptives are what they say in name: they act by stopping the conception. While emergency pills and what we call abortion are post-conception. Both are birth control (well, more like birth stopping) methods.\n\nI also defend later-than-most-people-agree abortions, but for me, contraceptives are great for ease of use and cost-efficiency, not really because of where we trace the line for pre-life/life. I can agree with considering the implantation, but I think that it's just a convenient place to define it.",

But I replied to a comment comparing the decision to take birth control and the decision to have an abortion.

The pill or a condom are much safer ways to avoid unwanted pregnancies.\n\nIt might be the better decision for her and the fetus to abort however avoiding pregnancies altogether would have been the better solution. I think we shouldn't view abortions as something positive but as the better of two bad alternatives in some cases. Being overly positive about ones abortions shows in my opinion irresponsibility.",

It just means that they went through the mental process of \"shit happens, gotta deal with it, no big\" and they get over it real quick.\n\nThere are a lot of stories from women whose biggest regret is getting an abortion. There are a lot of stories from women who feel guilty about not feeling guilty. There are stories from women who just plain don't feel guilty. There are stories from women who found it unpleasant but were grateful to have the option. There are stories from women who find it easier to get a string of abortions than get birth control or use condoms responsibly. There are stories from women who would never get one themselves but will fight forever for the rights of all these other women to get them under whatever circumstances they find themselves.\n\nYes, I feel that an abortion is a sad thing. But for me, in my own little bubble, in my own world with my upbringing and my experiences and my way of life, my sadness really begins and ends with the woman. She had to make this choice, she had to go through this (God forbid she went alone, God forbid there were protestors), she now has to decide if that was the right choice, she has to move past it in her own way and if she can't, *then* I feel for her. If she can and she moves on, power to her. If she aches from it for any reason, that's when it's a sad thing.\n\nFrom my own life and experiences, it's never a happy thing, even if it's a lifesaving procedure. It can be a relieving thing and it can be an okay thing and it can be a sad thing, but its never going to make me \"happy.\" For other people, sure, but I can't dictate how others see their own personal medical procedures. \n\nTL;DR yes, it is a sad thing, but only because *I* said so, and what *I* think about another's abortion is not important or necessary to that person at all.\n\nEdit!

That way, it's not really gruesome plus it doesn't already have its humanoid components.  To wait until that time and then get an abortion, in my opinion, is a bit much because why would you wait that long and let it develop that much only to kill it?  Like a six-month abortion for example.  At that point, you're more than halfway there and the baby is nearly finished with development, you might as well go with the birthing procedure and then give it up for adoption.  That's my personal opinion though.  \n\nAs for this video...I think it can be a bit much.  Good for her that she made a decision that pertains to her choice and how she feels.  If she feels great about it, then kudos to her.  Bragging about it to everyone else?  Yeah, I think that was probably a bit unnecessary.

You'd think someone who is exposed to this on a regular basis would know better than most. And yet she's shockingly irresponsible. Before I watched the video and read what she wrote about it, I was really surprised that some people believed she had intentionally gotten pregnant just so she could get an abortion. And I'm really disturbed to say that I am no longer surprised by that. She comes of as really superficial and naive in how she treats the issue. \n\nAnd yes, I am vehemently pro-choice. But I also believe a potential human being's life should be highly valued, which is why I think any sensible human being should reserve abortion as a method of last resort and instead be throughly aware of and try to prevent an unwanted pregnancy by responsibly using birth control, firstly. I don't see how, for example, someone could be proud of calling the fire brigade when their house is on fire due to their own lack of foresight and proper judgement. \n\nAgain, given that she's supposed to be a professional working in the field, her irresponsibility combined with her attitude is odd, if not shocking (and repulsive). She comes across as shallow and immoral. She's like a fireman who's house caught fire because she didn't look after the meat grill properly, and then brags about how her local brigade managed to put out the fire safely and in due time... \n\n\n",

They aren't unique to abortion doctors or clinics, and to claim they are is to demonstrate an overwhelming lack of knowledge about what's actually going on in reproductive healthcare facilities. ",

When they make a decision to have an abortion, it's easy for them to see the financial and career-related consequences of having a child, or simply to say, without needing any other motivation, \"No, not now.\" They think abortion shouldn't have to be as big of a deal as some make it. It's a medical procedure. And it's my impression from this sub that they often feel alienated in that view, like there's something wrong with them for *not* being emotionally attached when they make their decision. \n\nI don't think the first group is hypocritical, and I don't think the second group is heartless. The great thing about abortion being legal is that we are all free to approach it from different perspectives, with no one 'correct' set of criteria for making a decision, and nobody telling us we have to think about the fetus in this specific, certain way.",

I also feel that abortion after the point of brain development that can sustain sentience is unethical.\n\nThere are also modifiers. In a world like \"A boy and his dog\", where humanity is on the brink of extinction, every egg and sperm become sacred, and all rights of the individual are trumps by the needs of society. The opposite holds true in a world where over population is too much of a burden for humanity. \n\nRegardless of my ethics on the subject, I consider myself pro-choice and generally vote that way. I also do not judge those who have abortions as monsters, sluts, or whores. My values are far too nuanced for most. I get called horrible names from both sides of the discussion.\n\nPart of the sentience idea breaks down when you consider that the pigs and cows we eat are possibly more sentient than the unborn.

It's literally akin to a parasite feeding off a host, though people hate that comparison. Women should have the right to decide whether or not *they* want to continue providing support to something that is dependent on *their* body. \n\nBeyond that, there are a myriad of reasons a woman may not want to see a pregnancy to term. Maybe she's not financially ready. Maybe she's not mentally ready. Maybe she doesn't have the support that she wants from the father. Maybe she never wanted children and doesn't have faith in the struggling foster/adoption system. Maybe her SO is abusive. Maybe she simply doesn't want to go through the arduous process of a pregnancy before she's ready to.\n\nThere are so many struggles and problems that women can face upon undertaking a pregnancy. I find it disheartening that there's so much of a knee-jerk emotional focus on limiting and taking away access to abortion when we should be looking at the reasons *why* abortions happen and fixing as many as we can... While keeping in mind that bodily autonomy needs to continue to be respected.",

I think it's great that she's offering another perspective showing that it's not as scary as people are making it out to be.  It's refreshing for a change!  At first, I had an issue with the fact that she wasn't using a birth control method other than watching her cycle, which is not very effective (it's only 75% effective according to Planned Parenthood:  http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/birth-control-effectiveness-chart-22710.htm).  \n\nHowever, I thought back to my own experiences with birth control methods and realized that there probably was a reason for this (which she does state in her blog posting on Cosmo).  I've personally had five different BC pills, depo, the patch, Nuvaring, Nexplanon, and now I have an IUD.  The pills made me suicidal (my body doesn't produce the right levels of estrogen and it freaked my hormones out when I started getting it).  Depo, Nuvaring, and the patch made me break out into hives.  Nexplanon made me have my period for 60 days.  My IUD is pretty awesome, though, so I'm not going to complain about it.\n\nAnyways, the point I'm trying to say is that sometimes birth control methods suck and affect a woman's body in really weird ways.  I've had a nightmare of a time getting to where I am with birth control.  Thank goodness I have found something that works (hopefully.  we'll see.  haha, i've only had it for about a month).  So, while I do have issues without her using condoms because I'm a huge activist for safe sex, I definitely can understand why she doesn't want to use birth control.",

              "body": "Reading the comments here, I have a feeling my comment will get hit by a downvote bomb.  I don't understand this cavalier attitude towards abortion.  I see people trying to talk it down, like it's nothing more than removing a growth or a cyst.  I hear people saying that and I feel like they are deluding themselves to escape the pain.  If we make it look like it's no big deal, then we'll convince ourselves it is in fact no big deal.  Hell, I could argue that we're all just big mobile growths, cysts on the world, and subsequently justify removing said growths from the earth.  Society would condemn me sure, but only because the majority rules.  I digress.\n\nI want to see people owning their decisions, straight up.  If \"I feel in awe of the fact that I can make a baby-I can make a life\" then I must have the guts to admit when I take a life.  Pro-choice doesn't mean you have to like your choice, or hate it for that matter, but you must know what your choice actually is, with no delusions.  If you cannot survive with a child, and it will truely destroy your life, or the child's life, then go abort it.  It's a literal life or death decision, but you must own it.  Life is full of these choices.  Sometimes the innocent suffer because there is no right choice.  It happens in war, it happens in accidents, and it happens in self defense scenarios.  If it's the lesser of two evils, do it, but don't tell me it's a good thing.  Don't whitewash it and tell me how lovely and wonderful it is.  No matter how serene and easy we can make the operation, the truth is still there.  A life gets snuffed out.  It takes a bigger person to own the responsibility of the situation.  You can be forgiven for making that hard choice, and you can forgive yourself, especially if you needed to do it.  Take responsibility for your decisions, and don't try to trick yourself or others into thinking that the \"life\" you created wasn't really a life.\n\nAnd for the pro-life side, it takes big person to walk the walk.  If you want every baby to be born no matter what, then you better be working for the care and feeding of those children, or else you shouldn't talk either.  The \"don't kill babies\" argument is the high road, but it means nothing if the words aren't backed up with actions to love and support the world's suffering children.  Again, take responsibility.\n\nThe people who enrage me are the pro-choice folks who take no responsibility for their actions and flush a fetus because it's inconvenient.  The other people who enrage me are the pro-life preachers who don't care about the kids once they exit the birth canal.  Own your choices, and take responsibility.  That may mean raising a kid when conditions are less than ideal but still good enough, that may mean teaching all forms of contraception even when it's uncomfortable, that may mean stepping up and fostering kids, that may mean making a hard choice for survival, that may mean giving up your time to help kids in need be they your own or someone else's.\n\nTL;DR:  The rhetoric makes me mad.  Both sides of the issue have a lot of irresponsible, and sometimes, delusional people.  Take responsibility for your actions.  Own your choice, but don't whitewash it, learn from it.",

And I could see the other girls in the room knocked out and spread eagle all around me waiting for their procedures. Screwed me up big time. I have to take 2 valium just to get a blood test. I actually flat-lined once while in pre-op for a scar minimalization surgery when they swabbed in-between my fingers for an IV. Woke up to alarms and flashing lights and an aggravated nurse saying \"You said you fainted when you got your blood drawn- you didn't say your body shut down\". That's when I learned what a \"crash cart\" was.\n  Interestingly, the only time I could have my blood drawn/IV done sans narcotics was when I was pregnant with my (now 2 year old ) daughter. Even had an epidural with no problem. The day after she was born? Phobia kicked back in 100%. Weird how the mind works.\n  Good on this woman for sharing that just because our bodies can do something it doesn't make it a responsible decision to follow through with a pregnancy.

If, after being allowed to 'out' any pressurers behind her decision she still declines - that ultimately is her choice. \n\nEven in an extreme example: \"If you don't abort this baby I'm going to stop paying child support and your other kid will starve\" - if she chooses to comply instead of reporting the one harassing her, then no doctor can do anything about that and it negates the 'argument against abortion' that women are coerced. \n\nDo you understand the mechanics of an abortion vs a pap smear? A pap smear uses a speculum to scrape the outside of the cervix. The only difference between that and abortion is that the opening to the cervix is breached by a small tube. Yes, pregnancy will cause hormones in a woman, whether the pregnancy is kept or aborted. Not sure how that is considered relevant though. \n\nI agree Savita's death was unnecessary. It is horrible to think about what her husband went through especially. \n\nIn order to justify denying a woman's rights (bodily autonomy) in favor of an embryo, you must demonstrate that abortion causes a tangible harm to that embryo if it doesn't develop into a fetus/infant. That is truly what has to happen to justify taking away rights from a fully grown adult woman. And the reality is, that cannot be done. If it could be done, then would not spontaneous abortions (miscarriages) be more steadfastly investigated, with immense resources allocated to preventing them? \n\nI respect your right to your opinion even though we disagree. I hope that a case like Savita's never happens again, anywhere. \n\n> #How do Americans justify letting religion interfere with politics like it does we actually are officially a christian country whose head of state rules on behalf of god as well as having unelected clergyman have a say in legislative branch and we still separate better then you\n\nThat is painfully accurate.

What i dont support is abortion on demand im not religious i just don't believe the inconvenience/stigma/risk of having a baby outweighs the unique bundle of cells right to life i dont believe it should be up to the individual to decide what constitutes a life.In the uk we have a comprehensive welfare state(my money pays for abortions and child benefit social housing vaccination medicalcare childcare unemployment payment) \"cruel to bring a child into this world\" is a poor excuse of a phrase in the context of the uk .What really shocked me with regard to this post is the pure visceral distastefulness i find in the act the thought of it i cant stomach and the thought that anyone could find it empowering.As a adult i however concede i haven't gotten someone pregnant as well as reserve the right of any intelligent person to change my for obvious reasons i can struggle to empathise and yes i did go to a catholic school.The reason i started commenting was to get a perspective from someone like you to see if that would change my position(as well as other sources),thank you for your time.Ultimately i still see abortion on demand as a terrible injustice that id vote to stop #patriarchal chauvinist misogyny FTW # bought 0.002 abortions with my NI ballin # watched the grisly end of the vacuum at catholic school # babies can survive before 24 weeks #Marie stopes supported hitlers eugenics programme #seem to lack compassion #im not trying to be disrepectful just trying to lighten the mood #Vera drake ,revolutionary road and cider house rules arent good films #dyslexic so dont care about about grammar #How do Americans justify letting religion interfere with politics like it does we actually are officially a christian country whose head of state rules on behalf of god as well as having unelected clergyman have a say in legislative branch and we still separate better then you .I mean we actually elected someone from a catholic anti abortion party as an mp and still he actually represented his constituents",

She had an opinion about what was happening and what she was choosing, and I didn't see it as any added value to myself to judge that. \n\n> pro-choice ideology of an early foetus not constituting a life\n\nSome people believe that way, some don't. The gist of being pro-choice is not \"what is life\", it's \"the most qualified person to make the decision whether or not to continue a pregnancy is the person who must do to.\" It's \"I don't believe the government should decide when or if I become a parent,\" vs \"I believe the government should force people to remain pregnant who don't want to be, against their will.\" \n\n> many young women to be coerced into having an abortion\n\nThis is a claim often repeated by anti-abortion groups and activists, yet there is no actual data (beyond anecdotes) to prove this happens. I am involved in reproductive healthcare locally and we have not seen this at all. In order to clarify this, I need to explain what happens when a woman gets an abortion (generally speaking). \n\nA woman must first come in for a consultation, preg test, and then schedule the actual appointment date for at least 48 hours later. This is due to one of the arbitrary waiting period laws passed by anti-choice politicians. The woman may come on her own, or bring someone with her, but during the consultation she must be counseled BY HERSELF. In this counseling, she is given literature and information pertaining to adoption options, parenting options, and what is involved in the abortion. She's also given contact information for various financial support services for all of these. I would love to claim the literature is unbiased, but in fact it's mostly biased towards unsupported claims provided by anti-abortion groups (things such as \"abortion causes breast cancer\", which has no bearing in reality). \n\nThe woman comes back after 48 hours for the procedure. She is again asked, with only her and medical professionals in the room, if she is absolutely positive she wants this procedure. If she expresses doubt, at all, she is asked to leave and think about it. NOW - before you say \"that doesn't happen\", I want you to think for a second about the medical professional doing this procedure; if the woman has an abortion and later says \"I didn't want it, I was persuaded by someone else!\" then the doctor can be in legal trouble even to the point of losing license. NO DOCTOR WANTS TO GIVE AN ABORTION TO A WOMAN WHO DOESN'T WANT ONE. \n\nAfter the woman verifies yet again that she DOES consent to the procedure, and signs appropriate paperwork, the procedure is done - either given one of two pills for a medical abortion (she must take it in the presence of a nurse practitioner) or she is prepped for a surgical abortion (which is a misnomer, because there is no cutting into the body - it's more comparable to a pap smear). The abortion is done with a small vacuum device for early term pregnancies (which comprise 90% of all abortions). In recovery, she receives juice and a snack and is allowed to wake up some before she goes home. \n\nThe reality here is that women aren't forced into abortions or - if they are - they have multiple avenues during which to express that fact beforehand and take legal action. Now what happens in many anti-choice circles is a supposedly anti-abortion woman will choose to have an abortion and then later say she regrets it, or she was pressed into it. They don't want to own up to the fact that they are hypocrites. They are the ones who will protest at a clinic, but when they get pregnant they sneak in the back door so no one will see them, because their abortion is \"different\". \n\nI still don't understand totally what you were asking in your second paragraph, but I hope that explains more. \n\nAs for your scenario, first of all I'd question how she got your sperm without your permission (medical/ethical legal violation). If she illegally obtained sperm, I do not see any path on which it makes sense for her to inform you she's implanting embryos. As for the rest of it, I don't wish comment on post-birth paternal responsibilities because I don't believe it to be relevant to this thread. \n\n\n\n\n",

Couldn't it also be argued that the existence of abortion also allows many young women to be coerced into having an abortion as much making women criminals for having abortions did for forcing full term pregnancy.My argument being does either state ensure women have choice.\n\nAs an aside what do you make of this scenario i freeze some of my sperm ,then i lose my testicles while in hospital wife uses her last eggs (cancer scenario) to form embryos without my consent.We fall out of love she wants to undergo embryo transplantation in that case what would you regard as my reproductive rights/responsibilities .

No. Some people don't do well with the hormones in pills, some people can't have copper IUD's, etc. It isn't our place to tell her what method she ought to be using.

I feel much worse when I hear about an American child dying than one in the Sudan. Therefore, by your logic, only one was human.\n\nYou seem to be claiming that the fetus is not human, and then suddenly, poof, they are, as if the vaginal canal imbues the child with life. What basis do you have for this claim? What are they not 5 seconds, 5 months before they are born that suddenly they are when they are born? \n\nEven if you want to be blunt and say that you have no problem with women killing their unborn children, I'd be okay with that, because at least you are acknowledging what actually happens, instead of the usual contortion of saying they are not alive.

There is not great answer, just picking between two evils. \n\nSince this is the case I think that as a whole we should try to pick the lesser of two evils. I am sure people have seen the post on here with the documentary about what is was like when abortion was illegal. Freakonomics (currently on netflix, the podcasts are great too) as has a piece where they point out that is seems that with abortion there is a lower crime rate in societies. (correlation not causation)\n\nI am not going to force someone to have a baby in a bad situation, based on the fact that I wouldn't have an abortion. Being a unwanted child is a far worst fate in my eyes then not being born.\n\nHa! So really with all my rambling I agree with you. C: ",

It's action requires no action. If I act to stop it, is it wrong? Same with cancer, or someone accidentally crushing me to death. Besides I just link them to some link explaining that appeal to nature is a fallacy. Other times I state that abortion is older even then the concept of modern marriage.

If I'm not mistaken, women reach their sexual prime around the age of 25. \n\nYou also have to remember that it is unnatural for a woman to spend all her time child-rearing with one person(or by herself), so given the exigent circumstances that modern society creates, I'd say my point on self defense still holds true.

My doctors are convinced it would take a miracle for me to survive it. In other cases the chances are more like 2 out of 100000. \n\nThose are not bad odds but why are those odds the woman should have to take simply because she has better odds than me? The life of the mother is still in danger. 830 + women a year died in the United States alone because they delivered to term instead of had an abortion. These were not women who knowingly needed abortions in the late term for the survival of the mother and refused to have one or could not find access on time for the most part. These are women whose children, mostly children they wanted even, came out the wrong direction or in the wrong position. They died of blood loss or rupturing or an embolism or an aneurysm that came on suddenly and couldn't be resolved, something nothing but the statistic that 2 out of a hundred thousand women a year die from this could have predicted.\n\nSo, if abortion is justifiable in light of risk to the mother's life and all pregnancy risks the mother's life then, I ask you, as someone who just said that the mother's life overwrote the right to the fetus to continue developing, how can you argue that all abortions are not justifiable? They all hold the same risk, simply to different percentages. Some women are willing to take that risk because they would want that child but for women who do not want to take that risk what justifies forcing them to do so?",

I might be able to carry long enough for the fetus to reach viability, maybe, but the stress on my body from months of pregnancy would almost certainly kill me. Even if I had a C-section. The doctors have been very clear on that. \n\nIt's not my fault I'm in that situation -- I was born with a congenital heart condition that means my heart has trouble supporting me, let alone a fetus. Consequently, I'm paranoid about my birth control, but it's always possible it could fail. Even perfect use has a .02% failure rate. That's 2 in 10,000. Even if I chose abstinence I could also be raped and become pregnant from that. \n\nBut if I did become pregnant I'd abort. It's not worth the risk to my life. And if you *do* think it's okay because my life would be at risk and I took precautions not to get pregnant, then... well, your position isn't that there's no valid excuse to murder, is it? \n\n[Edit: To clarify my question.]",

You, however, took my comment out of context because, as I said, I was speaking explicitly to the fact that every case of pregnancy is a potential case of mortal peril, often with little to no warning sign. \n\nBut, then, this analogy doesn't work on multiple levels anyway. \n\nFirst, presuming the driver isn't *intentionally* attempting to hit the pedestrian and it's simply an accidental would-be collision the pedestrian's best chance of avoiding being hit isn't to attack the driver but to run / move out of the way of the driver. Comparatively, a pregnant woman doesn't have those options because she can't just 'move out of the way' of the fetus; her best chance requires terminating the embryo/fetus. \n\nSecond, the pedestrian/driver analogy falls apart because in that scenario killing the driver is neither necessary to achieve the desired result nor, actually, more likely to achieve the desired result. Killing someone behind the wheel is only going to make the car *more* out of control. \n\nNow, if the driver was intentionally attempting to hit the pedestrian then the pedestrian would have the right to defend themselves. Of course, the analogy falls apart *there* because an embryo/fetus is incapable of intent. \n\nSo, yeah, the pedestrian/driver scenario is not analogous to the risk of pregnancy/delivery. It's unlikely you're going to find one that is because the very fact the fetus requires the woman's very body to sustain it for months before viability even *beyond* the risks inherent in delivery and there's no way to dodge the baby but to deliver it, which can cause mortal or otherwise permanent harm.

In 2015 nearly 4,000,000 babies were born. While some of those babies were multiples most births are single, so there were around 3.9M delivers that year and approximately 830 women died as a direct result. \n\nEvery deliver has the potential for mortal peril. Full stop. There is *no way to know for absolutely certain ahead of time* whether there will be complications in deliver that lead to the death of the woman. Full stop.  \n\nEven a picture perfect pregnancy can have a fatal delivery or a delivery that results in lifelong health problems or even disability. Many women who survive have complications from delivery, including things like [obstetric fistula](https://www.fistulafoundation.org/what-is-fistula/) and [preeclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage, or ambiotic fluid embolism](http://www.webmd.com/baby/understanding-labor-delivery-complications-basics?page=3).

Pregnancy represents potential to (more than often without intervention) result in the creation of life and if you're ok with that, then abort away.

I may have articulated my argument poorly, but the general principle holds true - self defense is a right to take a life in defense of your own. When I'm citing that grievous bodily harm is a legal justification for defense, I'm essentially borrowing the same moral arguments used by lawmakers. \n\nBesides, if I'm not mistaken, the baby doesn't even develop a theory of mind until after its born.

A fetus, however is doing harm if it is using a person's organs without consent.\n\nAnd the parents imposed life on the fetus. It did not consent to being conceived.

Both living and dying fetuses can pose extreme and sudden risk to a woman. They can also pose slow and painful risk too. It doesn't matter. The risk is still there. Why does a fetus-person get more rights to a woman's body than any other person. It's not because they are innocent. We've already agreed innocent people can be killed in self defense. So why?

They have to both be a threat to you and actively impinging upon your rights bodily integrity  - including  mental Integrity - at that moment. You must believe that they are an active threat to your well-being and you may only do as much as is necessary to remove them from contact with you. All the exact statutes that apply vary by jurisdiction but that is the generalized definition required for self-defense to be applicable.\n\nOf course that means that a woman who believes that a pregnancy is  a threat to her well-being may take the necessary steps to remove that threat from contact with her. Since pregnancy is dangerous and can become lethal at any point in time with very little warning a woman does have justification for believing that a pregnancy is a threat to her. That's without even getting into the argument about it threatening her mental well-being, though pregnancy does cause real distress in women do not wish to be pregnant. But, even without that, there you have it: the reason to take steps to remove contact between the fetus and the pregnant woman under the auspices of self-defense.",

You can't just say something and make it true.\n\n>Killing a baby at 38 weeks for no other reason than you don't want a kid is barbaric.\n\nTo you. Thats your opinion. But a person still has the right to protect their body the best way they can. A late term D&C is still 14 times safer than a natural birth or c-section. Anyone has the right to choose THE SAFER OPTION. For WHATEVER REASON. Your opinions do not get to limit other peoples freedom.\n\nThat's not a straw man silent_hysteria. That's just the truth. \n\nIf someone doesn't want to donate blood, because their reason is their a jehovahs witness, and as a result their child needs to be rushed to a different hospital, to find a different donor. Yes, personally I think thats barbaric. But I don't have the right to force a person to donate blood against their will.\n\nAnd neither do you. Just because you think the reasons are bad, doesn't mean you get to remove the right to that. \n\n>I refuse to pretend the only difference between someone that deserves to live and someone that doesn't is which side of a 6 inch vagina it is on. \n\nThat's fine, thats your opinon, but like I said, a D&C is still magnitudes safer than a live birth, even a late term D&C. What risks a woman chooses to take that threaten her own body ARE HERS TO MAKE. NOT YOURS. NOT THE GOVERNMENTS.\n\n> It is your body..but at some point you have a responsibility to another life. I'm not saying life begins at inception... I'm just so sick of the f'n extremist with their all or nothing attitude and no common sense.\n\nI have the same opinion as you btw, with regards to late term abortion, but I recognize that my views do not get to remove the rights of others to make their own life and religious decisions. If that is extremist to you, or a strawman, I'm sorry that I couldn't explain this to you better.\n\n> On one side you have the holy rollers who think life begins at conception..on the other you have the buttons who think a 38 week old should die on a whim.\n\nIt is not a whim, it's a woman's life that is at stake. I'm sorry but not all dangers can be detected (many aren't) in time for someone to be given the right to an abortion. That very nature of it, the nature of the risk in of itself, means that you must allow anyone to back out of it at any time, for any reason.\n\nAnd the only time you can remove that right, is if you have a prior contract or agrement that stipulates you are choosing to go forward, and thus would be found criminally negligent otherwise. Such as with a surrogacy contract. But pregnancy in of itself, just like sex in of itself, is not consent to assume a risk for another. That's just like saying driving a car is consent to be in a car accident. This is basic human rights, right?\n\nBecause legally, just because you had sex, is not consent (legal contract) to a \"Duty of care\" that requires you risk your body and limb. Women are not, simply because they are female, equivalent to second class citizens who must arbitrarily die due to others opinions of their personal desires. \n\nI'm sorry I don't know how else to explain this to you. Do you understand the concept of th 14th amendment? Are you american?\n\n",

I tried to frame it in terms of consent and non-consent and a woman's right to say \"no\" to sex for whatever reason. but it seems you refuse to acknowledge that. \n\nAbortion is self defense. There is no such thing as \"stupid self defense.\" If a person is touching me and I don't like it, FOR WHATEVER REASON, I can say \"no\" and defend myself. Even if it's just \"I don't want to be touched right now.\" That's it. Even if its \"I'm a racist and a black person is touching me\" I still have that right. Similarly, if a person, (even if it is a fetus) is using my body without my consent, I can also say \"no\" for WHATEVER REASON. No matter who thinks my reason is \"stupid\" my rights are the same as yours. The freedom of religion, speech, bodily autonomy and self defense are not \"less\" for others just because you disagree with their reasons. \n\nAs much as I hate the idea of someone choosing to not have a kid due to its sex (as I personally feel this is wrong.) I cannot FORCE another person to give up their body against their will.

The laws of consent dont change just because other people want to impose their beliefs on others.\n\nIf that were the case, we could force someone to donate blood even if they didn't want to, because their \"stupid reason\" is \"not good enough.\" \n\nThat's fundamentally oppositional to the rights of the 14th Amendment. And even if you are personally morally uncomfortable with it. . . you have no right to subvert that.\n\nLike I said before, there is no \"stupid reason\" to refuse sex that makes rape suddenly okay. In the same way, there is no \"stupid reason\" to not want a baby that makes forced birth (slavery of women) okay. \n\n",

A pregnancy has the potential to cause harm or death thus poses a threat to mother giving her the right to abort the baby due this potential threat. Is this about the gist of the argument? Do you think there are any temporal issues with your argument and your supportive examples? You say if a person pulls a gun on you then you would have the right to kill them. Sure, I agree with that. But there is a big difference in the example. A person who has pulled a gun on you has shown grievous intent as well as causing the injured party little to know time to deal with the threat. Let's imagine someone pulls a gun on me. This would a threat in which I could justify my killing of said person. However, in this scenario they do nothing. Would I be justified in going to the person who pulled gun's house 9 months later and kill them because of the threat they caused previously? I don't think so. You say plenty of pregnancies are without complication. Is it not the case that the vast majority of pregnancies result without complication? If this were not the case then we would have far more motherless children. Furthermore, typically, the point in time when potential life threatening problems would arise are temporally located in the future. Essentially at a point in time decently removed from inception and at a point in time in which it would be too late to remove the child without even greater risk to the mother anyway. If I were to apply your argument to other situations I should be able to kill to justify any vague threat against myself even if temporally located in the future. ",

Please do try to be more sensitive, and try to familiarize yourself with women's issues BEFORE you enter the debate. I notice a lot of condescension when someone responds with variations of \"It's HER body\". There are victims of sexual assault that post in this sub. Te discussion of their bodies is a very sensitive matter, so please try to be more sensitive when discussing it. \n\nThis is obviously a very sensitive issue, and there are TONS of posters here who have personally been impacted. Discussion is always welcome, but try to avoid the condescension(especially when you're wrong). Women have to deal with enough of that already. I intended this post to be more of a support post for those that may still be struggling with their decision to abort. You might disagree, and that's fine, but please express your disagreement more tactfully. **/edit**\n\nIf abortion is indeed killing a human being(as opposed to merely destroying organic tissue), it is still justifiable. It is justifiable because it's self defense.\n\nThere is strong precedent in law that killing is justifiable if it would prevent death or grievous bodily harm to one's self - both of which pregnancy can cause. Sure, plenty of pregnancies are without complication, but the majority of women still go to the hospital for delivery. If you get shot and go to the hospital, your chances of surviving are pretty high. However, lethal force is still justified if someone pulls a gun on you. \n\nOne of the fundamental ideas behind law is that it is there to prevent one person from trampling on the rights of others. If unborn infants do indeed have a right to life, that right is not justified if it interferes with a woman's right to be free of grievous bodily harm and potentially a woman's right to life. \n\n**Edit:** Wow this blew up. For all the people saying it doesn't cause grievous bodily harm, you have to remember that reversible injuries(like fractures) could be considered grievous bodily harm. Some definitions even consider psychological damage to fall under that description. A complication-free pregnancy incapacitates a woman for a prolonged period of time, disrupts her hormones, appetite/body mass, sleep, psychology(not all women are accustomed to that level of pain), and during labor, her VAGINA STRETCHES. See my point about you being very likely to survive a gunshot. A reversible injury is still an injury, and there is still life lost as a result of it. \n\nAs for the sophists splitting hairs over whether or not killing is the same as murder, I'm not going to waste my time rebutting that. The idea behind the argument is much more important than the semantics. Definitions change(just look at what happened with the word \"literally\").\n\nAnd quit with the downvoting. My post more than contributes to the discussion. I'm sure I've hit a couple nerves(not that I care. If the pro-choice camp is in the right, then restricting abortion violates the woman's right to life and her body. If the pro-life camp is in the right, then the baby loses its right to life.), but disrupting the discussion entirely is not appropriate. If you disagree with me, then please articulate it in the comments section(and if you can, refrain from using sophistry. Sophistry still disrupts the discussion). ",

During actual slavery white women did not see nonwhite women as female allies, the suffragette movement was filled with women white supremacists women who supported lynchings and saw no harm in marginalizing nonwhite women. Kidnapping, rape, being branded, torturous experiments (read Medical Apartheid), strict laws regarding your movement and appearance, back breaking forced labour, forced family separations, having your children stolen from you and sold, not being able to legally sue or testify against a white person, not being legally counted as a \"person\", forced pregnancy and forced birth were all a part of slavery. Slavery encompassed many different harms so comparing forced birth to slavery narrows and obscures the multiple layers of dehumanization that slavery entailed. In modern years the women most at risk of those same harms (kidnapping, assault, family separations) are black and indiginous women, and the reason these women are more vulnerable to dying in childbirth is because of the legacy of colonialism and chattel slavery.",

If the comparison was being used to highlight how forced births in this nation have historically been harmful, if the comparisons was highlighting who has historically been most at risk from a forced pregnancy and whose most likely to die from forced births, then I\u2019d understand. The comparison as it\u2019s being shared now offers no nuance or greater understanding of the history of forced births and slavery in the US.

Yes it will probably never happen but please do try and imagine it's real. \n\nYou have been kidnapped by a masked figure. They want to play a game. You are being forced to make a decision. You must either give the okay for a young girl to get an abortion or condemn another ten year old girl to death. If you make a decision you can leave. If you don\u2019t both girls, and you, die. The masked figure promises you that if you do not make a choice he will kill both the girls. however there is no way to be 100% percent sure of their resolve to follow through with either deed\u2026 they seem crazy enough to go through with it, I mean they kidnapped you and put you in what looks like to be the outside of an interrogation room. Looking into the room you see the two girls whose future depends on you. The young girl being threatened with death seems oblivious to her situation, she is sitting waiting patiently nervously tugging at her skirt. The masked figure tells you she has been promised a slice of cake, if you decide to kill her then it will be laced with a deadly amount of arsenic. The other appears to be laying on a hospital bed asleep and peaceful, doctors at the ready. Why would they bother setting all this up if they weren\u2019t capable of following through? But you know for absolute sure if you make a decision the figure would follow through with your decision and let you go.\n\nCan\u2019t answer that one? Okay. Let\u2019s make it easier. Instead of poisoning the girl it is now dismembering her, piece by piece. Starting with her fingers and toes, moving up to her hands and feet, until all that is left is her torso. She\u2019ll survive but well\u2026. Or you allow the abortion. If you don\u2019t answer both girls, and you, die. \n\nWhat if the the young girl waiting for her abortion was a ten year old girl who was raped? How would you answer then?\n\nI think it is ridiculous to think that we should live in a society where it is 'unthinkable'. Think about it. Think about it real hard. If faced with these situations what would you choose? Is there really no right time for an abortion? There is a post on the front page right now about a ten year old girl that was raped, the assaulter got a life sentence, and she had a baby at great risk to her physical health and already damaged emotional health.

It is a question of when does human life begin. Because if the baby, fetus or embryo is human life then it is more important than the mother's freedom or pursuit of happiness. If it is not human life then it doesn't have any inalienable rights. So the mother's rights always are more important than the fetus. Since there is not really an accepted answer of when human life begins I had to determine when in begins to me. I think human life probably begins when 50% of the babies could survive if born. Which is 25 weeks. I could maybe believe that human life begins at 22 weeks, prior to 22 week survival is nominal. Late term abortions are already illegal. So current abortion laws don't violate the inalienable rights of the mother or the baby. Any additional laws violates either the mother's or baby's right.",

Unless you cure or prevent severe birth defects, cure or prevent fatal fetal conditions, cure or prevent maternal mental illness, and cure or prevent medical conditions of pregnancy and childbirth which threaten the life and health of the mother, it's not possible. Regarding birth control: even if it's free an available,  there are problems with sexual education, improper use of birth control, and risk of birth control failure. Even if you provide better education and counseling to women, you can't change the fact that pregnancy and birth permanently alter a woman's body and put her health at risk. Even if every pregnant woman accepts these facts, you can't guarantee her boyfriend won't beat her or leave while she's pregnant, that her schooling or career won't suffer, or that she will cope well emotionally. There are *so many reasons* women have abortions that are more than just, \"I don't want it,\" or, \"I can't afford it.\" To believe you can solve all the world's problems to the extent that you eliminate the need for abortion is naive, short-sighted, and ignorant. I'm going to guess that at least some of the following apply to you: 1) you may have limited experience with poverty, 2) you don't have any children, and 3) you have a basic support network of family/friends. I am highly resentful toward women who think their limited life experience and college degree must somehow qualify them to say women don't really need abortions. I feel the same toward religious women who hold others to their own personal and moral standards. It is my opinion that pro-life women have not truly understood things from the pro-choice perspective. I've been prolife. It's idealistic and ignorant. ",

They file pointless lawsuits, pass laws they know will be overturned by courts, make claims that aren't true knowing if they keep doing it, they will tire out the opposition and they will get some of these things done.\n\nFor example, notice how there are so many things Trump does that upset people?

Apparently there were secretly recorded videos that were allegedly debunked, those videos prompted an in-depth investigation by Congress, whose final report, as you say, is not debunked.  I therefore read it as truthful.\n\nI'm not some religious pro-life nut, birth control is fine, morning after pill is fine, if there are serious medical issues or serious social issues it's fine if it's done very early, but what is laid out in the report is absolutely disgusting and makes me sick to my stomach, to kill a human being like that for no good reason and then profit from it. Put it up for adoption if you don't want it, but don't just kill it in cold blood.  People value the lives of  cats and dogs more than  baby humans.\n\n\n\nTo think that babies at a similar age to when they were born are delivered alive and kicking then killed in cold blood is bad enough, that they're then sold to be \"researched\" for a profit is unthinkable and I can't see how anyone can reasonably defend it and still sleep at night, absolutely abhorrent.\n\nApparently one of the doctors investigated in the report is now serving life in prison but I have no proof of the fact since their name is redacted and it has been kept quiet.  That could very well be false.

Planned parenthood specifically modifies the abortion procedure to use illegal procedures to comply with these requests.  This results in live births which are then illegally terminated, the live baby has all of the constitutional rights available to other Americans.\n\nThe abortion clinic, Planned parenthood, has a financial motivation to provide late-term abortions and therefore a conflict of interest when advising patients on abortion, abortions are encouraged and occur when they would be advised against by medical professionals. \n\n**Pro choice to have an abortion does not nullify the child's human rights to life, yet this is what occurs.  Babies are born alive and then murdered, for profit.**  \n\n-----\n\nHere are a few copy & pasted relevant passages as requested, but you should at least make an effort to read the index and summary.  Pg 105-107 are one example of explicitly detailing how live babies were murdered, sonograms illegally falsified (showing the mother sonograms of other fetuses that were earlier in development than her own baby) and on two occasions the mother was not informed she was pregnant with twins. \u201cAs long as the patients had the cash, he was going to do it past the 25 weeks.\u201d\n\n>C.

Federal laws prohibit a specific abortion procedure that occurs seconds before\nlivebirth, and explicitly provide that infants born alive enjoy all of the constitutional\nrights available to other Americans.\n\n-\n\n>During the Panel\u2019s investigation, staff reviewed tissue procurement notes, email\nexchanges among researchers, TPB\u2019s and abortion clinics, invoices, and more\u2014all\nindicating that researchers want fetal tissue from late-gestation infants that has not been\ntainted by feticidal agents (e.g., digoxin).\n\uf0b7 The Panel also learned that abortion providers may modify abortion procedures, in\napparent violation of the law, to increase the odds of getting an intact infant cadaver (e.g.,\nincrease the number of laminaria placed in a patient\u2019s cervix to achieve greater dilation).\nClearly, these factors increase the likelihood that unborn infants are born alive during late\nsecond-trimester abortions, and raise the question whether these infants\u2019 civil rights are\nrecognized by abortion providers\n\n-\n\n>The National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) provides that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any\nperson to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable\nconsideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce.\n. . . Any person who violates [] this section shall be fined not more than $50,000 or \nxxii\nimprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d The term \u201chuman organ\u201d is defined to\ninclude fetal organs and subparts of organs.\n\n-\n\n>Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) also revealed that they intentionally\nhad not set a policy about \u201cremuneration\u201d for fetal tissue because \u201cthe headlines would be\na disaster.\u201d While the organization\u2019s executives told affiliates to \u201cthink, \u2018New York\nTimes headline\u2019\u201d if this went badly, at the end of the day, they thought \u201c[selling fetal\ntissue] is a good idea.\u201d\n\n-\n\n>Planned Parenthood executives who spoke with the Panel noted that 2016 is the 100th\nanniversary of the founding of Planned Parenthood. A closer look at the history of the\norganization, however, leaves little to celebrate. The organization was founded by\neugenicists who believed in limiting the rights of people to form families and have\nchildren if they had mental or physical disabilities or were of the \u201cwrong\u201d race. \n\n-\n\n>The Select Investigative Panel has made numerous criminal and regulatory referrals and\ninvestigations are underway around the nation. \n",

There was a recent case about this where medical professionals misdiagnosed a brain dead child in the womb, administered pharmaceuticals to destroy the child's life before term, the woman brought the child to term, and the child is still living and functioning normally.\n\n\n> And saying they ended their child's life.\n\nThey **did** end their child's life. OP wrote that he was 100% sure that his child was brain dead. I argue that it was not 100% because the methods used to diagnose brain death in children in the womb currently result in an error rate **greater than zero**. Brain death does not mean the child's body is not alive.",

This is unfounded and ignorant of the motivations of the position.\n\nPlease note that I  am an libertarian who is divided in this issue, I just believe we should not simply people's opinions on complicated issues like this to a simple lack of respect.",

What I do despise are people who want to force their viewpoint on controversial subjects onto others. Part of being Pro Choice is that I respect other people's autonomy. Pro Life people by definition do not respect other's autonomy, at least on this specific subject. Of course I do not believe in absolute autonomy, for example people should not be free to steal, however there is nuance in every facet of human behavior and abortion in particular is too nuanced to govern with a crude blanket rule banning the practice.\n\nFor example, my wife found out our unborn child had a brain defect. It was 22 weeks in. She had to have an abortion or spend months carrying a child that would not survive long after birth AND undergo a full-term birth. Do you really want to force my wife to do that?\n\nAs for your post, I find many parts of it odd:\n\n>I'm a mid 20's female with a post-grad engineering degree at a top university studying for a PhD. \n\nHow is your education relevant here? Sounds kind of humblebrag.\n\n>I'm the pro life person you all seem to despise - I think women deserve a society where abortion is unthinkable and nonexistent. \n\nAddressed above. You think someone should have to bear the child of their rapist? That's what happens when abortion is \"non-existent\". What if the rapist is the victim's father and the fetus has genetic defects as a result? Still all-in on that ban?\n\n> And I'd like to call myself a feminist - but I do not feel welcome at feminist events because I seem to care about the mother and her child. \n\nDefinition of feminist is pretty broad (no pun intended). Lots of people with differing views call themselves feminists. I am sure there are plenty of Pro Life feminists that I would not feel comfortable hanging out with. \n\n> There are groups founded by women out there who agree with me:\nhttp://www.feministsforlife.org/ http://www.secularprolife.org/ http://newwavefeminists.blogspot.com/ https://www.sba-list.org/\n\nEven if there was a majority that shared your opinion, it wouldn't make it necessarily right. Kind of irrelevant.\n\n> Anyway, I'm anticipating the downvotes and floods of hateful message to my inbox, but please prove me wrong, 2Xers.\n\nStandard right-wing victimization complex. Are you aware of the TheDonald right wingers who recently terrorized this site? Goes both ways honey. For the record, I upvoted you because I think this conversation is interesting, despite the fact that I think you sound like a loon.\n\n> P.S. Norma McCorvy, the Roe of Roe V. Wade, changer her view and is now pro-life. \n\nSo what? The opinions of just one person are just that. One person. This is anecdotal data at best. Did you say you were a PhD? For someone educated in the sciences, you sure picked some lousy data to support your point.\n\nIn short, I find Pro Life people to have an overly-simplistic view of the many reasons women choose to have abortions and a heavy hand when blocking the autonomy of others. Nothing you have said here dissuades me from that opinion.\n\nEDIT: I encourage people not to downvote OP's post even if you disagree with her. The best way to change people's minds is to upvote this post and all the comments that explain why her viewpoint is flawed. Burying this solves nothing.",

I grew up in an abusive house because my mother shouldn't have had children. The damage it has done on me and my siblings is enormous. I also think if adoption is preferred by pro lifers in this scenario they also forget the psychological impact on the woman and the children. \n\nI also think that as a animal species we need to recognise that it is normal and natural for animals to kill their young if sick/unviable. We are able to this in-utero to prevent suffering for that fetus/baby. \n\nI think it is worse to enact physical or mental harm on someone than to \"kill\" a fetus before it is actually in existence on this earth.

Everyone wants that society unless they're a monster. The problem is that society does not exist and probably never will sadly, and you have to acknowledge that uncomfortable truth.\n\nYour new wave feminist link points to \"pro-abortion\" views, where people due to circumstances are practically coerced into having abortions. Most of us here are not pro-abortion, we are pro-choice AKA pro-personal bodily autonomy.\n\nThing is, when that baby is born someone has to raise it. If the child is a product of rape, the mother just does not want a kid for whatever reason(financial, emotional, life change recently occurred, age, health,  baby's health, etc), they should be allowed to get an abortion. A person in a difficult position should not be looked down upon whether they abort, continue a pregnancy or put the child up for adoption.\n\nFurthermore, intense pro-life ignores health problems that can arise. If you're going to most likely die by continuing your pregnancy, would it not make more sense to abort and live longer to actually raise children with you in the picture? If your baby has a severe genetic defect incompatible with life(which ideally should cause miscarriage, but nature ain't perfect), is it not more ideal to abort than to go through the pregnancy and have your child spend a measly hour in the world or worse have to raise a severely disabled child you knew you were in no position to raise and having to deal with that yourself emotionally in either circumstance?\n\nThat is why I'm pro-choice. Having an abortion is not an easy decision. One does not stroll into an abortion clinic happy and smiling and ready to face the day. Abortion does carry risks to the mother too after all.\n\nShould the world be nice and happy where every baby could be born happy, healthy and taken care of? Yes of course, but that's a utopian dream. Everyone should be able to choose themselves what they want, because the alternative is far worse. Forced pregnancies, an uptick of dangerous births and a lot more severely disabled(physically and/or mentally) children parents don't have the capacity to take care of or children that parents have to see die before their first birthday due to forced pregnancy sounds pretty damn dystopian to me in contrast to those beautiful ideals.",

Put simply, it sucks, but I'm not going to be hateful about it. \n\nI call people who are against abortion anti-choice because people who are not against abortion are not against life. Hence, It's a silly term (pro-life). People who support the choice to have an abortion support people in their decisions to bear life, or not to. \n\nAnyways, like I said, I think people who are anti-choice are usually good people, and sometimes even smart. But, it's taking a moral stance on an issue that truly is a public health and maternal health issue, a very serious one (I work in reproductive health). I am completely ok with individual women taking a stand and saying they will never have an abortion, and even going so far to say that they hate abortion, find it sad, and want to make it less common. But, at the end of the day, we live in a world where often times it is not a blessing to be pregnant and bear a child. A world where often times a person becomes pregnant is the last thing she needs and wants to have a happy and healthy life. \n\nAnd for you, and people who hold your views to say that this person should not have the right to end the life of a fetus that DEPENDS on her to continue to live; I think is short-sighted, sad, and not seeing the big picture. I think we get really into grey area when talking about WHEN abortion access should be restricted (5 months, 6...etc.), but given that most abortions occur in the first trimester, that is less of a concern for me. \n\nIn sum, I don't hate people or women or feminists who do not support a persons right to choose how to deal with an unwanted pregnancy. I do, however, think that it's a less-smart stance to take when it comes to thinking about the health and well-being of future generations and of our planet. Take care. ",

Doctors should use their morals and ethics to determine what procedures they feel comfortable doing, and ultimately patients decide what procedures they are okay with having.\n\nUltimately the best way to rid the country of abortion is to provide ample access to effective birth control methods for both men (hopefully a pill one day) and women, educate the masses about sex effectively (no more southern abstinent only BS), and have a robust, effective, and quality adoption/support system that can help pregnant women who can't support a child connect with families that are wanting to adopt and care for the child.",

If anything though, this reinforces my point that the pro-life right has its priorities wrong, and that moral horror at abortion is just so much hot air if you're not willing to address what causes it. If abortion is unconscionable to you, your number one priority should be campaigning for government-mandated and -sponsored maternity leave so that a baby doesn't mean total household economic destruction. Number two is still sex education and availability of contraception.\n\nAlso, I said that abortions were something that women suffered psychologically from, not that the psychological suffering children cause is a justification. Your ideal world seems to be one where women put up with unwanted pregnancies as one of life's many inconveniences, but a) none of those other listed inconveniences are a massive physical burden on the mother's actual body, b) all of them are people with agency.",

People aren't being mean by claiming you're not a feminist... they're just saying how it is.\n\nYou're free to believe whatever you like, you just need to realise that \"pro life\" is not a compatible view with feminism.

              "body": "Some hostility to people who call themselves \"pro-life\" is because they're really just anti-abortion.  They support the death penalty, they cheered CIA torture, they oppose even the slightest and most sensible gun-control measures.  That's not pro-life, that's pro-death.  They just use \"pro-life\" as a euphemism to make themselves sound noble and good.  Who could be against life?\n\nTied into that is the sense that anti-abortion people don't actually care about babies at all, they just want to limit the choices women can make because women shouldn't make choices.  I have had the discussion more than once, with a supposed \"pro-life\" person, in which I asked \"If Candidate A said he would ban abortion, but had no coherent plan to do it, and Candidate B said he wouldn't try to attack abortion legally but instead would put in place health-care and other social programs to increase access to birth control, and any pregnant woman could get prenatal care and new-mother help and there would mandatory maternity and paternity leave, and there was good reason to believe these moves would cut abortion 90%, which one would you vote for?\"  In every case, the \"pro-life\" person said they would vote for Candidate A, because even believing abortion should be legal was unacceptable to them.  The actual number of abortions was less important to them than the candidate's position on whether the government should make it illegal.\n\nIt was obvious that those people weren't pro-life, but they aren't even anti-abortion.  They're just \"Stop this thing that women do which I don't like.\"\n\nThat would get a lot of hostility all by itself, but coupling it with the rank hypocrisy of claiming to be \"pro-life\" just makes the whole thing disgusting.\n",

So then Christian sites had headlines like 'Even pro choicers support dramatically stronger pro life reforms'.  \n\nIt's hard to gauge how anybody really feels about it when both sides  are deliberately twisting information.\n\nLike I said before, pretty much every woman I've heard from personally is \"I wouldn't personally have one, but it's not my place to tell another woman what to do.\"  And the few I've come across that are solid pro-life have all been religious nuts.

True, A mom does not have any legal obligation to give any part of her to another person even her child. She is not required to risk her life for another including her own child. But... is she allowed to poison or physically harm someone who is passively doing so? If a women say \"no I am not feeding you.\" Or \"don't implant on me.\" Or walk away from a pregnancy, It would be one thing.\n\n But does it still hold true if there is not just a rejection no but intentionally causing harm and death via poison or mutilization to the other entity? \n\nI keep hearing people say, 'how can you think abortions should be legal. What about medical abotions, incests, rape etc.' They are the gray that should be up to the women.\n\n Example\nMy heart breaks when I hear of the couple in the Holocaust who were hiding from the natzi and their baby cried. I would not charge them for murder for saving themselves from (fairly) certain death by suffocating their child so they were not found. I would cry with them and try to never bring it up unless I thought it would be healing for them. That is how I view medical abotions. \nOr a parent who has to decide to not save her child in a storm and because it would probably swallow them both and kill them if she tried.\n\nI would support the above instances of abotions\u200b being legal. I would be horrified if they were denied.\n but not the below 1. That they don't want to be a parent or 2. That the kid is better off dead then not be raised by them/ being stuck in this twisted world. In those instances raise it to term and then give it up for adoption as soon as it pops out.\n\nAll instances of life and death/morality are drawing lines in the sand. The modern world is figuring out where to draw. In Rome you were not a real human even after you were out of the womb. You had to reach a certain age before your life and ability to keep living was socially acknowledged. We are deciding as individuals and society now when that happens. Of course we will disagree. \n\nBut the pro choice who is enraged by the parent who intentionally takes the life of a 1 year old is experiencing similar feelings as the pro lifer who does not want 3rd trimester abortions to be legal.",

              "body": "Hey there. I have been through an incredibly similar situation. Over a year ago (July 2013) I found out I was pregnant. I was 21 at the time, as was my bf. I was 18 weeks along when I found out and 20 weeks when I aborted. Unlike you, I showed minimal signs. I conceived sometime around late March and starting mid June I had a couple of weeks of nausea. Just like many symptoms, I saw the nausea as a symptom of other things. The thing that got me to take a pregnancy rest was that in the span of one week I had three bouts of \"morning sickness.\" We waiting on aborting immediately so that I could get onto Oregon Health Plan and have it paid through insurance. Just like you, we had to go out of town for the procedure, which in some ways made it scarier. As for the procedures, it was relatively painless. The afternoon before the procedure, they had to insert a small pin-like object into the cervix to help it dilate (apparently it was some sort of kelp or sea weed that has a certain chemical in it that helps with dilating). Insertion of the pin was momentarily painful, but went by quick. They'll warn you that once the pin is put in, there's no going back on the decision. Then I went home. They gave me a pill that I was supposed to take at 7am before the procedure, but I misunderstood them and accidentally took it at 7pm the night before. That pill gave me cramps like none other. Seriously awful cramps and bleeding, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was equal to contractions and the starting symptoms of labor. As for the procedure itself, I was put under anesthesia, so I don't remember anything. And you won't either, they make a point of it. After I started waking up from the anesthesia, they had me out of the clinic within half an hour. They gave me a vicoden prescription as well as prescription strength ibuprofen. Cried immediately once me and bf got to the car. That was no fun. I took some vicoden soon afterward and made a point to at least be on the ibuprofen for a few days. Come evening time that same day, I felt back to normal. To be honest, I experience no pain afterward other than some mild cramping. I probably didn't even need the vicoden. I was told I'd bleed heavily for at least a week, but it only lasted three days for me. \nSome difference you may want to take into account. I've always had a very mild period and my pregnancy symptoms were also very mild. So for me to experience minimal pain after the procedure was not surprising, but I wouldn't necessarily expect the same for you. There was no real pain involved and I expect that'd be the same for you. Heavy cramping is what I'd look out for. \n\nSo... Here's a little about myself and some of the things I endured emotionally before and after. \nMe and my bf had been dating for 3 and a half years, since senior year of high school. We were very much in love and had previously thought we would be together forever. He always wanted kids and I wanted kids because he did. On the subject of kids, I've always been comfortable with the idea of going with whatever my partner wants, because I think I could be happy either way. However, I've always told myself I won't have kids until I was ready and that I would have an abortion if that's what it meant. My bf was very supportive of my decision. He was almost done with his degree and would be able to support me if need be, even though he would have preferred to get his master's if a child were not involved. During the time we had to wait on the procedure, there was a lot of internal struggle involved. Despite all my feeling about kids, there was always doubt. And along with that, both of us started questioning our compatibility. After the procedure, I started developing a lot of issues. First off, it was PTSD. No matter how much I tell myself I made the right decision and I know it's what best for me, there's still a lot of regret and it's really hard to explain why it's there. I don't have a single reason to want a child and I'm glad I don't, but the issue is still there nonetheless. Next, I developed some anxiety issues. While relatively mild usually, crying infants send me into a panic. This is a pretty normal symptom of PTSD. I experienced a lot of depression (and bipolar disorder). This is something I had before, but worsened after the procedure. I put myself into therapy about two weeks after my procedure and it's done a lot to help me cope. I don't necessarily expect this to happen to you, but it is really common and I'd recommend at least a couple sessions no matter what. \n\nI really hope you're doing okay. It's a struggle and I hope you come out of it better than I did. If there's anything else you need, please let me know. ",

The symptoms are hell, and some of them stay with you after the pregnancy, like vericose veins or darker lady parts or just wider hips. It's cool if you want the kid, you make it work, but if you didn't? It sounds like a beast. People who get abortions are totally justified, whatever their reasons, and people who choose adoption are total super heroes, too.\n\nI suupport your choice to not just not raise a kid, but also to not continue your pregnancy. It's a lot bigger deal than a lot of people realize. \n\nGood luck. I'm sure you're going to do great. Also maybe take a pain killer before the appointment? I'm sure the clinic can give you more tips. ",

        "body": "**TL;DR:** Found out I'm 23 weeks pregnant. Because life seems to get the best of me, I am carrying not one, but two babies. I made the decision to abort the pregnancies, and I am seeking advice from anyone who has undergone a late term abortion. I'm so insanely scared right now!!!\n\n\nWell ladies, I don't know how I've managed to ignore the symptoms for 23 weeks (apparently I conceived June 30?), but I'm pregnant. I. am. FREAKING. OUT.\n\n\nAnd not in a good way. I'm 22 years old, in school, and have a lot of other exciting and awesome things (like my boyfriend, Hunter) going on in my life. Hunter is THE BEST thing to ever happen in my life; I love him in a way that I can't really explain with words. He is, undoubtedly, my \"knight on the white horse.\" My plans for the future consisted of him and me traveling the world together, and I am really looking forward to spending all of our money on things like a nice farm in the countryside, charitable causes, and cruises...because we weren't planning on having children.\n\n\nBut today, our Double Income No Kids dreams were shattered after a trip to Planned Parenthood. Hunter had been insisting that for months, I was not pregnant. And there were lots of symptoms to prove him otherwise, too, I just was in such a deep state of denial that I simply could not accept the fact that yes, the missed periods weren't because of my ovarian cyst (I've never had regular periods, anyway). No, the nausea and vomiting was not from mixing my prescription meds with alcohol the night before. I took a test about a month after the conception date, and it came up negative. So, I was convinced that I was not pregnant. I ignored my instincts to test again. WHAT was wrong with me?!\n\n\nGod, thinking back now, how could I have been so foolish? My boobs hurt all the time, they became MASSIVE. I wasn't losing weight despite being on a low carb diet, and I actually gained weight. So many symptoms were brushed aside and disregarded because they just weren't that severe. I had relatively few symptoms, but now I can see how, yes, I am FUCKING PREGNANT.\n\n\nI'm sure many of you have been in the same situation, probably not as far along as I am - a week away and I would not be able to have made the decision I made: I chose to have an abortion, a procedure which I am having done tomorrow. I am traveling to the nearest city for my appointment, which will take 5-6 hours each day for the next two days. \n\n\nLuckily, I have an amazing boyfriend who treats me like a queen, and a mother who was been (surprisingly) very supportive. We have to stay in the city overnight so we are renting a hotel room, which my mother offered to purchase. I'm so grateful to her, to Hunter, and to have a plan as solid as this. I'm just so damn scared right now. \n\n\nI'm mostly scared of the pain. I don't know what it's going to feel like, or how intense the pain will be. I have to deliver two mango-sized lumps of cells out of my hooch, which is a cause for great concern as well. Has anyone in the community ever had a late term abortion? I'm so scared. Any words of advice would be so greatly appreciated. I'm not sure why I've stopped crying already. Frankly, I'm not sure why I'm not screaming and tearing my hair out. I'm so strangely calm when in actuality my life is in worst case scenario mode. \n\n\nP.S. To those of you amazing gals that chose to keep your pregnancies, despite all odds, you da real MVP. Seriously. I could not imagine accepting responsibilities of another human - uh, make that TWO humans - at this point in my life. Shit's crazy.\n\n",

Do you remember the article Ashley Judd wrote in response to people commenting on how she \"must have\" had work done when she had a puffy face and how most of them were women? Or how about the video that's been on youtube where a woman walks around with a gentleman getting other women to sign a petition to end women's suffrage (in which they blatantly lie and say suffrage is women suffering. If you're going to pull a prank like that, don't be stupid and lie about it. enough about that though.) But when someone comments on sexist things being posted on facebook, or girls supporting the war on women and posting about it and showing their replies and we rip them apart for their *grammar*. REALLY?! *really?* Do I need to go all Amy Poehler here? Let me point something out, I've had guy friends who respect me and who I respect say \"when I see girls tear each other down for expressing opinions that support women based on something that might simply be something they grew up writing, I'm honestly not surprised the Religious Right are finding it so easy.\" When we tear each other down and get catty and bitchy over stupid things like chat speak on facebook (come on, my aunt uses chat speak on facebook. I don't, I hate it, but some people talk that way. *get over it.*) it's almost like the demons of patriarchy have won. \"Oh look, the hormones and emotions are taking over the stereotypical women, we have defeated them in what they thought was their own battle by forcing them to succumb to the stereotype they claim to not be.\" So think before you simply rip someone apart. \n\nWe fight over whether the pretty girls have a right to be pissed off, or the skinny girls, or the ugly girls, or the fat girls, or the blond girls, brunette, green, purple, polkadotted. **WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?!** It's what the people who are trying to move us back to pre-sexual liberation era want us to do, because it keeps us distracted from the fact that the Lily Ledbetter act is under fire, as is birth control, abortion, planned parenthood, and I'm sure more rights that we don't pay attention to because we're bitching at each other about shit that doesn't matter. So put on your big girl panties and deal with it. So what if someone makes a typo, writes ppl instead of people, uses then instead of than and their sentiments are expressed. So listen up, stop tearing each other down. I'm sure I'll get some hate for this, and great, bring it on, I *do not care*. All I care about is that if someone sees this and says \"alright girl, hell yes, let's get back on the focus, which is women should be for women and their rights, and not tearing each other down.\" then I know I've got at least one person that's pickin' up what I'm layin' down.

Before anyone considers that as judgemental, let me say that I too had an abortion, at 12 weeks, when I was 18 years old.  I was a freshman in college, my boyfriend was unemployed, and I was terrified to tell my grandparents who raised me as a result of my parents having me at 18 and 19 years of age.  When I went to have the procedure I asked to see the ultrasound in order to really take responsibility for the decision I was making.  It was by far the scariest day of my life.  I often think about how different my life would have been had I chosen to keep the child, but I have never regretted the decision I made that day.  My grandfather died 2 months after, and I still believe that had I chosen to keep the child I would have forever lived with the fact that he would have died disappointed in the daughter he raised.  When I was about 28 years old, I had a miscarriage 2 years after marrying the man who was the father of the first child.  That miscarriage nearly destroyed my marriage, and even when I became pregnant with my son 3 years later we spent the entire pregnancy living in fear.  I truly believe that all that happened was God's way of showing me that you must trust in his timing rather than your own or there will be hard lessons that follow.  I know on judgement day that I will have to answer for my decision, and I can only hope that my children will not have to ever make such decisions for themselves.  Take this as an opportunity to make better choices in your life.  Protect yourself from ever having to make this decision again.  Make choices as far as education and future goals that will allow to be the parent you want to be one day.  All that being said, you sound like a bright woman who has potential.  Do not let this decision define you.  Do not share it with many people because I assure even some that love you unconditionally will make you doubt yourself.  And know in life nothing productive comes from dwelling on regret or the past.  Learn something from this experience and move forward with purpose so that this experience will not be in vain.  Raising children is the hardest and most rewarding job on earth.  It is not to be entered into lightly, so make sure you protect yourself and another unborn child until you are ready to become a mother.  \n\nThere is an innocence that I forever lost on that day because I discovered that I was able to make a decision that I never thought I could make, but I also became accountable for my decisions and started to realize that every choice has consequences.  No matter what you have been through in your life it does not have to define your future or what kind of parent you will be.  No one is ever really ready to become a parent in reality.  It is something that you become over time long after the actual birth of a child.  It is something that evolves out of love for your child not out of the misfortune of the past, if you will it to be so.  Our pain in life can break us or make us into stronger and better people.  It is up to you to decide which of those paths you life will take.  You are braver than you know, and one day this will all be the past too.  Stay strong, follow the doctors orders, go to your follow up appointment, and take the time to grieve.  You have made a decision that is right for you as far as I can tell from your letter.  Now have faith in yourself and God to move through this.  I wish you strength and the ability to forgive yourself because we all make mistakes.",

When I was first diagnosed with my issues the doctors had me on heavy awful medications. They warned me if I were to get pregnant, I wouldn't live or either would the baby. But me being 22 years old and living with my ex at the time I didn't take caution. I ended up choosing to abort at 8 weeks. It was the worse experience for me. I know my health was on the line and so was the babies but just knowing there was a slight chance the pregnancy could of made it kills me. If or when you do it, don't let regret haunt You like it is doing to me. Don't live on \"what ifs\" or \"if onlys\" I guess I'm not as strong as I thought I was at the time. My ex took it way easier than me. Hopefully your man is strong for you. Mine was saying dead baby jokes while I was in tears in recovery. I guess what I am saying is that it is your choice, this is America, just know that once it happens there's no turning back. And I do know when I am pregnant again I will love my children with all my heart and would do anything for them. Soon to be married though! Oh and now I've researched and am not on those awful meds. With a healthy diet and exercise and vitamins I am doing great. ",

It is so important to be open about our abortion experiences, to let people who have gotten abortions know that they are not alone, to end the stigma that surrounds abortion. \n\nI experienced an unwanted pregnancy in my third year of university. I never got around to scheduling my abortion appointment because I experienced a miscarriage. I waited months before I told anyone that I had been pregnant and then had a miscarriage, I was worried about how people would react when I told them I was so relieved and grateful about the miscarriage. I was worried that people would think I was a monster for not mourning or grieving the lost pregnancy. When I finally did open up, I was shamed and made to feel guilty. People told me that my feelings were wrong, that I should be upset about my miscarriage.  I decided to stop talking about it and to pretend like it never happened. \n\n2 years ago I started volunteering as a clinic escort at my local clinic and I started opening up again about my miscarriage and my positive feelings towards it. I was so amazed by what I found. The people that I volunteered with and the staff at the clinic didn't treat me any different. They didn't call me a monster and they helped me realize that my feelings were legitimate. \n\nHowever, most importantly they taught me that contrary to what I had been told by other people, I wasn't broken.\n\nI've never felt regret or grieved over my miscarriage, it was the best thing that could have happened to me at that point in my life, and for that I am eternally thankful and grateful. There are many women, who like me, are happy, healthy, who have no regrets and who do not grieve their abortions or their miscarriages, but a lot of the time our voices get lost in the shame that is projected on to us from the anti-choice movement that tells us if we don\u2019t feel grief or regret we are not \u201creal women\u201d or we are terrible people.\n\nTo all the women out there who feel as though they are unable to speak out about their experience, you are loved and you have nothing to be ashamed of.

Nine months does not overpower that fact.\n\nEDIT: this is not saying that I don't understand and feel for you in your situation 10 year ago. 21 is a young vulnerable age and sometimes decisions happen and I would never say you are a bad person for the choice you made.

        "body": "Hey everyone, first time post.  After reading a number of women's abortion stories here I feel obliged to share mine.  \n\n10 years ago today I had my abortion.  At the time I was 21, had just finished college and about to start my dream job as assistant manager of a medium-size business in my hometown that I had interned at for several months.  \n\nMy boyfriend of 3 years and I had always been careful to use protection but one graduation party got the best of us.  I think half of my morning sickness was the baby and the other was the sickening question of \"What do I do NOW?\"  To have the baby would mean taking several steps back on my career and I just wasn't ready to be taking care of a baby.  \n\nThe only person I spoke to about this was my mother.  She has always been a bit liberal but I didn't expect her to be so quick to suggest an abortion.  Yet after speaking to her it seemed so clearly the right thing to do.  She helped drive me to PP where the staff was friendly and welcoming and the procedure went as well as could.  All except for an immediate sense of loss afterwards.  \n\nA few days later my boyfriend, who had moved with me, sensed something was wrong and asked where I had been.  My excuses of hanging out with my mom weren't well designed and it eventually came out that I had gotten pregnant and had the abortion.  He was outraged.  We had spoken about getting married and having kids before, but I never knew how much that had meant to him.  I spent alot of time crying because at this point the reality of what had occurred sank in.  I had chosen to take my baby's life rather than be willing to slow my career.  Life less important than work?  What was I thinking?  After 10 years down this path I can tell you, work is not worth it.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I broke up.  We tried keeping it together for many months, but he couldn't get past how I could make the decision to abort his baby without evening talking to him.  And that is my biggest regret by far.  \n\nI have since married another wonderful guy and we have two children.  They are the love of my life and I cannot imagine a world without them.  Ironically that dream job went bankrupt so I now work less hours with a smaller business, but that's fine with me so I can be home more often.\n\nA few final thoughts: Women, if you are thinking about an abortion, please talk to the father.  You have a moral obligation since it is as much his child as yours.  And don't expect any true counseling at PP. In hindsight, despite several conversations with the PP staff, not one seriously suggested any other choice but an abortion. Its a business like any other and their only intent is to usher you to the procedure table and wave goodbye.\n\nThank you for reading my story.  I don't judge anyone who makes the choose for abortion and hope my experience helps you with your decision.",
