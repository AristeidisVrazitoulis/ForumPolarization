I took 4 Tylenol over the course of that time and also Dramamine for nausea. It definitely felt like a bad period but actually nowhere near as painful as I was expecting from some peoples stories. I already feel much better and now the cramps are like a regular period. Overall, I was expecting much more pain. I guess it also depends on your specific pain tolerance. A heating pad is a must have, but honestly, it will probably be over before you know it. It\u2019s probably better to be expecting the worst (like I was and it sounds like you are) because then when it\u2019s easier than you thought it\u2019s a relief.

Instead of religious style judgment, it was comforting to find so much information out there that supported the mother\u2019s choice and affirmed that the baby\u2019s soul is safe, whole, and has our best in mind. The baby\u2019s spirit is our teacher and, regardless of our decision to live with it on the earth plane or not, it does not suffer nor judge us, and it does not want us to feel guilty. Feel free to communicate with your baby\u2019s spirit and thank it for teaching you. It can be invited back in a future pregnancy or it can stay with you as a spirit guide.\n\nOther helpful information was that during pregnancy, the baby\u2019s spirit freely comes and goes in/out of the womb/spirit realm. At birth first breath is what seals the spirit to its body, but until then it is not fully attached. When you physically end the pregnancy, the spirit doesn\u2019t have to be inside the fetus during the chemical or surgical process, so it can avoid any pain or discomfort if it chooses. This was a huge relief for me.",

They ask me to come in again on 4/8 to make sure a) it\u2019s not an ectopic pregnancy b) the abortion worked. Then on 4/9, I got a call from pp telling me my bHcg is 332 and they confirmed that since it had dropped more than 50% it means I\u2019m no longer pregnant. \n\nThen 4 weeks + 2 days later I\u2019m still testing strong positive for pregnant. And my belly is like bigger than usual. My boobs are bigger but not sore. I sometimes feel nauseous but not sure if it\u2019s from the anxiety. I\u2019m so confused and tired. Did the abortion fail? I\u2019m like crazy right now, sometimes I\u2019m like they confirmed it has ended sometimes I\u2019m like I know my body and it\u2019s not normal. So pls give me some advice\u2026",

I appreciate you sharing your experiences on this sub.\n\n\"Call your doctor\" is great advice.  \"Get antibiotics... they're cheap and worth the trip to the pharmacy\" is inaccurate medical advice.\n\nAlthough you're right that most clinics recommend not having sex post-abortion, there isn't actually evidence behind that advice.  I don't hold it against clinics that give that advice; abortion medicine tends to be quite risk-averse, and medicine in general places low value on our patients' sex lives: asking for no sex for two weeks doesn't seem like a big deal (and usually isn't!) so why take the risk?\n\nHowever, even in clinics that give that advice, a patient having sex within that time period wouldn't cause any change in antibiotic recommendations.  Rather; none of the doctors I know would do that, and doctors who would do that aren't following guidelines.",

I would add one that helped me: realizing that any person who, with utmost certainty, can tell me what is right for me (no less with respect to such a big decision) without knowing ANYTHING about me is very obviously to me someone whose opinion I am not interested in.  People I trust and love are people I can go to and who I can talk to and they will listen. If I\u2019ve already made a decision (as was the case for you and was same for me.. immediate decision and no regret) these kind of people just support you.  And if someone was actually unsure and looking for guidance it should only be trusted from someone who will just listen and help them to unpack this complex question.  Again, to summarize, and I get kinda steaming when thinking about it: I MEAN HOW RIDICULOUS AND UNTRUSTWORTHY are people who would assert that you should bring a child into this world without a modicum of information about you and your life and your goals.

There is a strange mindset that a lot of abortion providers see which is \u201cthe only good abortion is MY abortion.\u201d I have had multiple women at my clinic tell me straight up that abortion is wrong, and they would absolutely tell anyone they knew not to have one \u201cEveryone knows all these other women are just having abortions because they\u2019re sinful. But I HAVE to have one because :fill in the blank with a reason 20 other women are there that day:\u201d These people truly believe that no one has an excuse to have an abortion until they themselves need an abortion. A couple times we have even had the protesters who stand out on the sidewalk come in in hats and sunglasses because \u201cmy situation is just so out of the ordinary, I\u2019m an exception.\u201d (Spoiler alert, having an abortion because being pregnant right now would get in the way of college is not an \u2018exceptional circumstance\u2019 ma\u2019am. It\u2019s a valid reason that at least 5 other women in this building have at this exact moment.)\n\nSo take everything those voices say with a grain of salt. They\u2019re purposefully disregarding your feelings to revel in sitting on their high horse and passing down judgment. But take it from someone in the trenches every day: if you put a lot of those people in your shoes right now, you\u2019d be floored by how many of them made the same choice as you. They\u2019re static. Let them fade into the background.\n\nHere\u2019s a link to collected stories from other abortion providers: https://www.prochoiceactionnetwork-canada.org/articles/anti-tales.shtml regarding this same phenomenon.",

Like, it's as if no one in my state who has accidentally gotten pregnant has gotten an abortion???? Even my family doctor, she didn't even ask if I wanted to keep it or not, she immediately said congrats and gave me a bunch of things about having a baby? Like what the hell, that's kind of crazy to me.\n\nBut anyways, I called my insurance, was told I would not be covered at all. I called Planned Parenthood, one that I scheduled an appointment with a few weeks ago, which is also about 3 hours away from where I live which is kind of scary to me because I don't travel like that. I just go to school and work. Well I asked what kind of assistance they offer and they said I would be charged a 125 fee for the first appointment and then the financial assistance I would get would be a reduced medicine price of 385 instead of 500? Like that's a lot of money, and I want to save up as much as I can, I mean I could pay for that, but I really need money for my own rent and bills, do you just get what I mean?

A baby/kid is not a friend, they are  their own person who can grow to resent you or love you and be with you,  they are not there for your problems you are there to help them not the other way around. You will be this child\u2019s mother not their friend. You need to find friends your own age or older now and not expect this from a child you will have to raise. \n6. But do you want to raise a baby, do you have the support you think you\u2019re going to get. \n7. You can still do this now, there is no shame on doing this with your partner or with friends. \n8. You can do this later when you\u2019re 100% sure, yes you can be a fun mom, yes you can be there for this child and make them happy.\n9. Of course it\u2019s exciting but remember there are more important things to remember. \n10. What do you want. Is he going to help you if you decide you do want to keep this baby? \n \n Cons\n \n1.are you on medicine that can help you? \n2. I don\u2019t know why this is a problem?..\n3. Yes, there will be medical stuff in an abortion and if you decide to have this baby full term. \n4. That\u2019s good to hear \n5. Seems like you\u2019re probably going to do everything by yourself,  ask yourself if you can you handle that.\n6. If you\u2019re not sure, maybe it\u2019s best to maybe put yourself in a high stress situation and see how well you do. Do you remember the last time there was too much noise, remember how you felt, and remember what you went through. \n7. Living conditions sounds bad, but it can be manageable. \n8. This sounds like a con to really think about. \n9. This also sounds like a con to really think about. \n10. Okay \n11.

Im 3rd year psychology student but been struggling due to disability and question if ill ever ne able to work.\nWe don't have much money. I also have psychological issues from being mistreated by my family and have had no contact with them for almost the wholr 6 months.\n\nIm not sure what the pros and cons are really. I have a cruise on the 14th december (10 nights) so Id either have to have the abortion before it or be pregnant on the cruise.\n\nI dont think this place is big enough exactly and I dont think or know if we would handle a baby.\nId probably never be able to work if I kept the pregnancy since Id have to care for the baby and also Im disabled.\nMy boyfriend made a joke about abortion so I dont think he would really want to keep the baby. I also have no money so he would be paying for the abortion.\n\nPros: \n1. Gain a family since I lost mine essentially\n2. Get to go baby shopping and do everything that I was left out of during my sisters pregnancy (I was excluded).\n3. Prove to myself that I can do it. Since my mum bullied me for a year that Im a selfish person and would be a incapable parent (saying cps woukd be involved) and to not get pregnant (while my sister had an Oops pregnancy and raised her kid in the family home heavily leeching off parents). \n4. Maybe only time I could have a baby\n5. Gain someone else to talk to since I dont have much friends\n6. I may never work anyway and may regret if I thought I was doing this so I could work then actually didn't due to disability\n7. I actually loved going to kid centers and only stopped when I was too old because I had no choice so this would be an opportunity to do the childish things I like doing.\n8. I feel like Id be a fun parent and the kid would get to do a lot of fun things\n9. The thought of having my own baby/child is kind of exciting and I wonder what he/she will look like (i have brown eyes and bf has blue).\n10. Boyfriend wants kids but maybe not now.\n\nCons:\n1. I have BPD, complex ptsd and depression and I can't say it wouldn't effect the child. It seems not as bad right now but its on and off.\n2. Acne seems to run in my family and migraines and some health issues run in my family.\n3. I have severe tokophobia and fear of medical stuff\n4. I enjoy living child free\n5. Id have to do most of the work carring for the child as my boyfriend is lazy and also works\n6. Im not sure I could handle the noise without having a mental break down\n7. Im not sure if this house is big enough and we cant afford to move\n8. It will likely affect our welfare payments in a bad way.\n9. It will damage my body and probably make me gain a lot of fat.\n10. May not get to go on a cruise again, unsure. Thus far I have been going on 1-2 a year.\n11. I have little money and my bf may resent me uf we are dipping into his.",

        "body": "OK--here is my question:\n\nDo you think that elective orchiectomies (castrations) for sterilization purposes should be available to men in a safe, medical setting (as opposed to in a \"back-alley\")?\n\nThis question is not an abstract one; rather, this question is a very real and relevant question for me personally considering that I myself want to become a eunuch in large part for sterilization reasons but also, if possible (after all, I still want to get erections using my penis) for feminization purposes and to reduce my sex drive.\n\nNow--why exactly am I asking this? Well, many pro-choicers, both on Reddit and elsewhere, have told me that they are unwilling to deal with *any* risk of an unwanted offspring being born. Thus, I see absolutely *no* reason for me to be okay with *any* risk of this occurring. However, since I myself obviously don't have the option of abortion (and would *never* rely on *any* woman's word that she will get an abortion *regardless* of whatever promises she made to me beforehand) and consider the idea of abstaining from penis-in-vagina sex with *all* fertile and potentially fertile women to be both utterly unrealistic and utterly unacceptable, there is no other acceptable choice for me in regards to achieving this goal other than castration due to the fact that *all* non-drastic contraceptives and sterilizations have a failure rate.\n\nAlso, before someone brings up the \"Do no harm\" principle, I would like to point out that:\n\n1. This principle was already thrown out of the window when doctors performed many/most medically unnecessary elective surgeries.\n\n2. Self-castration attempts and \"back-alley\" castration attempts are *much* more dangerous than getting castrated (as in, getting an orchiectomy) in a safe, medical setting.\n\n3. There is *no* other way for a man to get himself sterilized in a way which *cannot ever* fail.\n\n4. The worst effects of castration can be mitigated/dealt with the help of hormone replacement therapy.\n\nAlso, in regards to lawsuits, let me say this--first of all, as far as I know, there are waivers for doctors to significantly reduce or eliminate this risk. However, even if one ignores that, it is worth noting that, short of a massive botching of my (planned) castration (orchiectomy), I myself would consider it to be extremely immoral to sue a doctor for performing a castration (orchiectomy) on me. After all, if I will even try suing such a compassionate and caring doctor for doing this, then this doctor might become more hesitant to perform elective castrations in the future, which in turn could very well result in more self-castration attempts and in more back-alley castration attempts (both of which are (much) more dangerous) afterwards. Thus, for me, suing such a doctor for doing this is absolutely intolerable!\n\nIn addition to this, please don't lecture me about biological differences! After all, I myself have absolutely *no* intention of being a slave to biology! After all, just because biology is unequal and unfair certainly does *not* mean that we cannot and should not make it more equal and fairer.\n\nThus, again, my question here is this--do you think that elective orchiectomies (castrations) for sterilization purposes should be available to men in a safe, medical setting (as opposed to in a \"back-alley\")?\n\nAny thoughts on this?",

              "body": "I had my MA at home \u2013 took misoprostol 36h ago. I know some people waited a long time but I was in the thick of it 30 min after taking them orally, zero buildup. \n\nI am? was? 7 weeks along and it was visceral and feral and horrific. I have therapy booked and plan on having a very long and angry conversation with my doctor who told me to expect a day 1 period. \n\nLoads of people appear to have had positive experiences with it but here are the things that either helped the most or that I would have done if I\u2019d known how bad it was gonna be:\n\n(sorry if this is thematically disorganised/formatted weird, I\u2019m on mobile and typing as it comes to me) \n\n1. Make sure your support person is comforting, not squeamish, and someone who does well under pressure. Don\u2019t do it alone or with someone who will be emotionally unhelpful. My mum was cradling my head as I cried and puked and shit myself all at the same time and honestly the cradling and stroking my hair helped more than fetching anything or massaging sore areas. \n\n2. Try to have a full meal a good number of hours beforehand. \n\n3. Prepare all the sugary drinks in flask. Cold fruit juices, hot sweet teas. Plain water too. The sugar will help give you the strength to ride it out/recover right after. \n\n4. Prepare a variety of painkillers (except aspirin). The naproxen they prescribed didn\u2019t work for me, and I maxed out on the dosage of paracetamol pretty quickly. I would\u2019ve paid a lot of money to have had some ibuprofen or codeine or literally anything else. \n\n5. You may want a cold washcloth as much as you might want a hot water bottle. \n\n6. Get all the pillows you can to prop yourself up. Also having something pressing on my belly and a bunch of pillows against my back helped a lot. \n\n7. Put a basin by your bedside just in case\n\n8. Be mentally prepared that when you\u2019re upright (e.g. on the loo), you may pass clots that are about plum-sized\n\n9. Make the person riding it out with you forcefeed you fast-acting painkillers during the worst of it. \n\n10. Get your hands on some ambien if you can. \n\n11. Wear granny underpants with the longest overnight maxipads you can find, and line the bed with a towel (not just for blood but the cold sweat). Go to the hospital if you bleed through one maxi pad per hour. \n\n12. Your legs may shake violently in exaggerated movements as if you\u2019re doing it deliberately \u2013 this is a really natural response to release tension when your body feels unsafe\n\n13. Also one of the terrifying things was not knowing how long this pain would last \u2013 for me it was an hour. It\u2019s not forever, you can get through it, take long breaths and scream and moan if you must. I bit my mother.\n\n14. Expect to feel weak after the worst of it is over and try your best to be attuned to whether you\u2019re actually emotionally ok or just holding off on processing the horror of the experience. Go gently. \n\n\nI\u2019m aware how scary this sounds but tbh while the pain was terrible I think the worst part of the whole experience was just the absolute terror of not knowing what I was going through because I hadn\u2019t been prepared.",

So I am a recovering heroin addict. I have been in recovery for 3 years now after almost. Decade of first prescription medication for lupus and a neurological issue and then heroin when I lost my insurance and couldn't get the legal prescription anymore. I know now that I was using opiates to mask more than physical pain, my finance died and I was raped and the opiates helped me numb my brain. Sober and healthier I can see everything different and I am damn lucky my younger daughter was born without issues due to my prescription pain meds...\n\nAll that being said leads me to 2 weeks ago... I've never had regular periods and so missing one wasn't a huge flag.. I can't explain how I knew but one day I woke up and I knew I was pregnant. I've been with my boyfriend for 4.5 years. Neither want more kids, he never wanted children at all but has fallen in love with my kids and treats them as his own. So I pee on a stick and sure as shit. I'm pregnant. What happened next was a tornado of bullshit. He reacts so poorly I leave and go to my parents..I was conflicted and needed my partner to help me and come to a decision and instead he threatens to leave me and tells me I'm a fuck up and a problem and have always been and I get an abortion and continue life as we have or he's gone and won't ever speak to me again...4 years .. and that was that. I went to the doctor and found out it didn't matter what I decided...at this point I had made an abortion appointment after alot of thought and tears..I had a tubal pregnancy. My partner came around and we talked. It's not perfect but that's a story for another day, and Monday I had a medical abortion at 11 weeks. I'm lucky it didn't cause me permeant damage or worse... The salvaged my tubes somehow and after 3 hours I was home in bed recovering. The rollercoaster of emotions is insane. I can't cope with life on the best of days due to my drug use being my means of coping before..I'm learning how to handle emotions and life and this is beyond my ability. I haven't relapsed and I won't. And I'm trying to be \" normal\" for my kids and my bf but I'm falling apart. I'm having incredible physical pain still, and I'm still bleeding heavily on and off, but emotionally I'm a wreck. One minute I'm okay knowing that to save myself and be here for my babies there was no other choice... But I'm still grieving the loss...and it frustrates me. And then the guilt kicks in for having a sense of relief that it's done and over with and my life remains as it was. I feel like a monster and I'm so tired of pretending I'm okay. \n\nHonestly I don't know what I was looking for with this post.. I'm happy to answer any questions about myself, my experience, the abortion and anything else you may want to know. I'm very comfortable answer anything truly.. it's therapeutic in a way writing this all out and talking about it no matter to who...",

It wasn't anywhere close to what I thought the pain would be.\r\rAs soon as the fetus passed (6 hours total after pills), the pain stopped. I was 5+5. The bleeding was no where close to the blood I saw after surgical, and lighter than my regular periods, and lasted 5 days, with the first being the worst.\r\rEdit: Please do not take your mothers drugs. Take a few extra strength Tylenol instead (spread apart). You have no idea how her meds can affect you.",

And the placement of a UTI soon after ! \n\nI had a surgical abortion about a year ago, with a man who I learnt was a psychotic drug addict so the choice then was very easily made.. I went in expecting it would be painful... I didn't expect i would be going through the most excruciating pains of my life. \n\nI was already cramping up from the cervix softening pill I had to shove up my vagina. When I went to lie on the operation table I felt like fainting. The procedure went well, but was nonetheless traumatic. The feeling is traumatic. As soon as I came off the table I vomited with the pain, but that was just the start. \n\nI laid in an unbearable cramp from 9 am til 15pm. The doctor and nurses said it is very rare for the procedure to hurt that much. I had shots of tramadol, diclofenac, ibuprofen... Nothing worked, nothing even registered. \n\nAfter hours and hours of crying with pain I had a shot of buscopan, which finally brought the pain down to a managable level. I finally left the hospital and got home. After that procedure I had two weeks of very heavy bleeding, about a pad every hour.. Called the hospital who said I should go to A&E in case I felt dizzy... Never felt dizzy and I just tried to forget the whole experience as quick as possible. \n\nNow I am a few days removed from doing the medical abortion. I feel so angry at myself. Is there really such a high likelyhood that I will be in even more pain then last time? I always have had very painful periods.. I much rather let the uterus cramp up naturally then allow a doctor to stick a suction needle in, because that's what provoked the most excruciating, never ending cramp.. My mother has a ton of pain meds like oxycodone lying around in the house, maybe I should take some? She even has fentanyl stickers.. ",

My first MA (8weeks) was absolutely horrible. I was in so much pain, I was screaming, but I didn\u2019t take pain killers properly. My second MA was not that bad as I knew what to expect and what to do. (7weeks) So Make sure you have a hot water bottle, good set of pain killers , and maxi pads.

        "body": "I hold the sometimes unpopular opinion of being \u201cpro-choice\" on the matter of abortion. Though I will note that if I were ever in a situation where I had to choose, I would always choose to keep the fetus/child (but that is, however, MY choice). My reasoning for being pro-choice is simply because I believe in the equality of rights. I believe that there is no one right that is more important than the others. I believe that legally, no person's rights should/can infringe on another person's. Without this understanding that all rights are equal, there is really no reason to have rights. If one person's rights can be weighted more than another's, it essentially undermines the very definition of a right which is supposed to be inherent in everyone and resolute in the sense that it can't be taken away regardless of one's social status, economic status, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. \n\nTo further explain, let me start by saying that I believe that a fetus is a person from the moment of conception (meaning sperm-ovum unification). By stating this, I acknowledge the fact that the fetus then also has rights, particularly the right to live. At the same time, I also understand that the fetus-carrying mother has rights, particularly the right of bodily autonomy (meaning she has the right to decide what happens to and inside of her body). Now that it is established that both the fetus and mother both have rights, I want to reiterate my belief in the equality of rights.\n\nThe fetus' right to live therefore, cannot infringe on the mother's right to bodily autonomy. This is the justification or reasoning for my pro-choice stance. The objection that I assume most would have against my stance is that abortion effectively kills the fetus and infringes on its right to live. My response to this would be that removing a fetus from a mother without puncturing or doing anything other than detaching it from the mother is not \"effectively killing\" the fetus. After removal from the mother, however horrid it may sound, the fetus has every chance to survive on its own. If it does not survive, it dies an unfortunate death solely because it is not developed enough to survive on its own. It would not be considered an unjust death. I'm not saying that removing the fetus from the mother is not the ultimate cause of its death; because it is. I'm only arguing for the equality that should exist among both the fetus and the mother.",

Do I need the signature of multiple doctors?  What if I can't get in to see them in time because of long wait times? What if it's a case of abuse, rape, or incest, where a teenager may not be able to go see a doctor, or a woman needs to get away from her partner? What about kids who get inadequate sex ed and dont know they're pregnant? What if it's a condition that has a range of outcomes, such as Down's Syndrome? (That is to say, some people with Down's are highly functioning, but some are not; for a poor family or a family with other children, it may not be a burden they can take on, not to mention the fear of what happens should healthcare not be easily accessible, or should you pass before your child...Who takes care of them and with what money? How can you protect them from being abused?) There are SO many questions that ultimately should be left up to doctors and parents to decide, because how in God's name will you draft a law that can adequately cover every circumstance? \n\nI think ending 'frivolous' abortions (and to be clear I myself support abortion at any time for any reason, but as a shorthand way to describe them) needs to rely FIRST on effective sex ed, and free or at least cheap access to birth control. This is proven to lower abortion rates and has a host of other benefits such as stimulating the economy, because when women are in control of their fertility, societies are stronger and wealthier. In addition , we need more family friendly policies, such as free daycare, paid guaranteed parental leave for both parents, free healthcare for the children of poor parents, etc.\n\n Regulating abortion only results in dead women. Providing safe access to abortion, good sex ed and contraceptives, and family friendly policies will lower abortion rates, because women will be able to prevent pregnancies and make the choice to keep the baby. \n",

              "body": "I think there's ample evidence that, by and large, women do not want to have late(r) abortions, and that doctors don't particularly want to perform them, which suggests that the minority that take place later on are due to extenuating circumstances.  As such, I personally find time-related restrictions on abortion (or restrictions that are essentially aimed at acting as time restrictions) to be fruitless.  Getting fewer second-trimester abortions is a function of increasing access to first-trimester abortion, not criminalizing abortion after a certain number of weeks.\n\nI pretty strongly believe that abortion restrictions in general end up tying doctors' hands and create a chilling effect that is dangerous for women.  Criminalizing abortion after 20 weeks, for example, begs the question- just what, exactly, qualifies as \"saving the life or health of the mother\"?  It sounds simple, but in reality, it's often subjective, with different doctors wanting to take different approaches (one may want early preventative intervention against the possibility of morbidity, another might want to adopt a \"wait and see approach\", for example).  We need only look to Savita Halappanavar to understand how abortion regulation can interfere with proper medical care- even when it's crafted to supposedly allow exemptions in these rare cases.\n\nSo no, I don't think there should be laws limiting abortion based on the gestational age, although I agree that it's better for everybody for them to happen earlier on, when possible; it's less costly, less risky, less invasive, and less emotionally taxing.  And to that end, we need to make sure that first-trimester abortion is easily accessible, along with trying to prevent unintended pregnancy and augment the social and tangible support provided to mothers and families.\n\nSome late(r)-term abortions are always going to be inevitable, but I certainly don't believe it's as high as the ~11% that currently take place in the U.S. after the first trimester.  I like to think with concerted effort to expand early abortion availability, combined with effort to reduce unintended pregnancy, we could get that number down much further.  And I do believe it's an admirable goal.  Reproductive freedom certainly extends beyond 12 weeks, but there's not a whole lot of \"choice\" involved when a woman seeking a 7-week abortion has to get one six weeks later due to completely unnecessary roadblocks in her way.",

I felt so alone because even if somebody wanted to help, they couldn't, I had to do it all on my own. The only one I told was my best friend of 10 years. And I would recommend you find one person to talk to about it. Or call a hotline for women in unwanted pragnancies (sorry I don't have any resources, don't know, where you are located). Talking about it really helps. Just make sure it's not a friend or a hotline that will try to sway your decision.\n\nOther things that helped me were:\n- my bf doing things for me in connection to the abortion (e.g. being there for calls, giving me a massage after appointments) just so you feel like it's not unfair, you are in this together and he does stuff too, to make this a manageble experience. If you feel like he is trying to avoid the situation: call him out on it. Tell him you don't want to deal with this either but you have to and he should support you. He should be asking you, how you are feeling, what symptoms you have to deal with. It's hard talking about it sometimes but otherwise he will never learn how hard it really is.\n\n- reminding yourself, that this will be over soon. You feel lost and alone now but it will be better soon trust me. You will feel such a relieve after it's over. And then take some time for you and your partner (if it's possible)\n\n- i know it's hard but remind yourself that it's a good thing your body is healthy and is doing the things it's supposed to do. It just did it at the wrong time. Took me a long time to get this one. I hated my body so much and resented it for betraying me.\n\nIt will get better trust me. All the best to you.",

And now all I want is kids. I see all my high school friends with kids on social media too and I\u2019ve started to become jealous. I spend the day with this baby that adores me and I absolutely adore him, but as soon as mom gets home, he forgets I exist and I\u2019m kind of taken back to reality.

Im down to answer questions if they are respectful. \n\nIn college I was in a two year relationship and I was an Resident Advisor my senior year. I had free housing and I had my then girlfriend living with me . I was a senior and she was a junior. Throughout my senior year living with her was comfortable. We had sex often and we got a little too relaxed with protection. I occasionally used condoms and she was never on contraceptives. We told ourselves if pregnancy ever occurred that we will choose abortion. The problem was that I guess we were on different pages about the time and place in which it would be okay to get one. two weeks after I graduated she tells me she missed her period and we agreed a test was in store. She went to get a pregnancy test and long story short she is pregnant. My response was calm because we talked about what to do prior. Well, what she didn't tell meis that she went to the clinic with her mom to get the test and her mom suggested she keep the baby. I told her that I didn't have a job yet, we lived in two different parts of the state and that her family was already financially borderline close to losing their home. She pleaded with me that we should focus on the \"what if\" and pondered to us working things out. I went into fight or flight mode and told her that I didn't want kids with her and that she should reconsider before bringing a child into this world that would would only give pain. I told her that Il pay for it too. We argued. I gave it time and we talked about it often. Ultimately she got an abortion because I succeeded in making her feel that the situation was bound to get worse if the kid.  The day she got the abortion she didn't want me there. She told me of the people outside the clinic that she saw protesting. I told her i didn't care. she got the abortion and ultimately I was relieved while she was heartbroken and confused with emotional baggage of having to do something she didn't 100% want to do. Time passed and ultimately her family became homeless. this reaffirmed me that I made the right decision. To this day I know my quality of life would not be the same and that I would have the opportunity I have now if it hadn't been for what happened. I did make a promise to myself however. looking back I felt bad about what I did even though I would never change the outcome. The next time I get a girl pregnant she will receive nothing but my full support regardless of how I feel what she chooses to do with her body.",

My future child deserves the best - it deserves a mother that was taking folic acid regularly prior to getting pregnant (BTW, if you want to keep the baby, start taking folic acid today - it's crucial for preventing birth defects), it deserves a stable home and a good income, it deserves having 2 parents who are ready to take care of it. So I had an abortion out of love for my future children. Of course, you could decide differently and keeping the baby might be right for you. \n\nGood luck! ",

I was not emotionally, mentally, or financially ready to have a child yet, even with a loving bf who was ok with whatever choice I made. He actually wouldve preferred I kept it, but he respected my choice not to. BUT please dont have the baby out of guilt! If he cant handle you being pregnant, tell him he does not need to be involved. And if he cant handle that, he shouldnt have unprotected sex/sex with multiple women within the same timeframe. Thats HIS issue. Dont let what he wants make the decision for you. Pregnancy is so intimate and transformative for many women, and it sounds like it already is that way for you. For you and your possible baby, choose what YOU TRULY WANT. Ps, the pill was painful, but it\u2019s honestly just like a really really heavy intense period. All its doing is inducing a period for you, before the fetus actually becomes a full on baby. This happens to women naturally all the time, you would just be inducing it yourself, which is not evil or wrong. What would be wrong is bringing a kid into the world without being very positive it is what you want. Please do what makes you happy. Much love to you. ",

I live at home with my grandparents where I don\u2019t have to pay any bills (thankfully). I also help nanny for my sister, she has 18 month old twins. I work part time for a cleaning company and drive a shitty car. \n\n\nI was seeing this guy who we\u2019ll call Jared. He\u2019s not the greatest guy but just one of those guys that get you hooked and you just can\u2019t walk away no matter how bad things are. He has a \u201cbaby mama\u201d their daughter is almost two. And they have an unexpected baby on the way. (From the last time they slept together before meeting me) she didn\u2019t find out she was pregnant until she was almost 4 months due to medical/health issues. \n\nWell now I\u2019m pregnant and immediately knew I should have an abortion. But every ounce in my body doesn\u2019t want to. My sisters keep saying things like \u201cthis won\u2019t make Jared love you\u201d \u201cyou don\u2019t want to be tied to Jared for the rest of your life\u201d. The thing is, I don\u2019t want him to love me, I gave him the option to pretend like he never knew I was pregnant and no one would ever have to know this was his baby and I\u2019d do it myself with the help from my family. But he said he could never live with that and because he couldn\u2019t, he needs me to have the abortion because \u201cit\u2019s just not the right time for us to have a baby\u201d (Jared\u2019s words). \n\nI know in my brain that I should follow through with my appointment tomorrow, but I know in my heart that I will regret it til the day I die. I\u2019ve only ever wanted to be a mother, I\u2019m so scared that I could be giving up my only opportunity, even if the circumstances aren\u2019t perfect. \n\nI\u2019m not looking for judgment on the fact that I want to try to keep this baby in such a terrible situation. I\u2019m looking for a light at the end of this extremely long, dark tunnel that I haven\u2019t even stepped into yet. \n\nI deal with intense anxiety and depression and my self image and self worth are pretty piss poor, I\u2019m just so afraid I won\u2019t be able to come back from this  \n\n\nEdit: I think it\u2019s worth mentioning a few more small details. I\u2019m white and Jared is black, I live in an area with only a handful of black men, so my friends that know I was seeing him would know right off the bat. But with that being said, I live about 45 minutes away from where he lives and even further from where his baby mama lives. So with him having no car, I could easily keep him out of my life, at least because I can physically separate myself from him. ",

And I hate condoms. So I\u2019m looking into copper IUD\u2026 I\u2019m sorry about your rough experience.

I wanted to catch the sac that came out too but when it did come out   I was on the toilet and when I got up I had to throw up A BUNCH so I turned around and slammed the flusher and threw upppp. It was a split second decision to flush, I wanted to at least look at it up until that point. I thought keeping and looking at my lil baby would further traumatize me. I regret not reaching my hand in to retrieve my lil baby. The thought of her (in ALL of my dreams it has been a girl so I like to think it was a girl) in the sewage makes me SICK. When it dawned on me she's floating out there, I had a nightmare I was making my dad take the toilet apart because maybe it got stuck in the pipes... I regret not retrieving her so much. I have cried about it a lot. It would have been nice to bury her. I also was thinking about storing her in a jar. (I'm a bit of a science nerd too.) (Sorry if the details are a bit graphic but abortion is just one of those things) It helps me to think of her as my angel.\n\nI'm so sorry you're dealing with this. I'm glad you get the opportunity to have some type of memorial for yours. I hope you can find peace within yourself \u2764",

        "body": "The process was about 9 & 1/2 hours, from 5:37 pm -3:15 am ish.. I kind of waited as I wanted to take this earlier in the day, but because my boyfriend had a client before this, I didn\u2019t want to do this without him there. From the moment I woke up, I was crying knowing that I had to do this today. When we were gonna get food before it, I couldn\u2019t help crying at his front door. His parents were in their room by the front door, & I couldn\u2019t control my crying. My boyfriend told me to be quiet so that they wouldn\u2019t hear, but I couldn\u2019t. We went inside his car & he asked me what was wrong..I said \u201cwhat do you mean? This is happening today.\u201d He asked me \u201cyou don\u2019t wanna do this, huh..?\u201d & I said \u201cI have to.\u201d & he asked again & I said the same thing again. I told him the same thing I said the first day I found out, which was that I didn\u2019t want to have an abortion, or to be pregnant in the first place. We also went to Walmart & I stayed in the car. Before he left, he told me to come out the car for a bit & look away, & he punched his tool kit & went to go inside Walmart :( I felt kind of scared, & when he came back, he said that he was just really stressed about this situation, and also bc the same day, his parents and his grandma were asking him to do things yesterday & today when he wanted his undivided attention on what was gonna happen..he didn\u2019t want me to see, which is why he told me to come out the car..& I get why he felt that way.\nSo I was waiting until he came back from cutting hair, took the ibuprofen, then the misoprostol, & 30 minutes after I inserted it, I felt the full front effects of it. I started crying realizing that I was actually doing it, & my tears were those of mourning/grieving towards what we made. I started to get really nauseous, & I couldn\u2019t reach the bathroom in time and threw up in a plastic bag :( I threw up so much that I choked on my vomit bc I had to breathe at the time. We actually got really freaked out because the doctor told me that I shouldn\u2019t be nauseous, but we were given a booklet that I told my boyfriend to read & he said that it was okay. At that time I already needed help walking from how painful it was, so he helped me every time I got up to go back & forth from his couch & his bathroom..I would take really small steps bc my uterus was in so much pain to the point where I wanted to ask him to carry me to & back..when I would get on the couch, he would lift my legs up because I honestly did not have strength to carry myself & sometimes I bled onto the couch to which he cleaned up w hydrogen peroxide ..I was barely conscious. I think the dose was so much for my body that I was freezing for almost the whole time until I passed the embryo. I needed a jacket, or when I\u2019d be on the toilet, I\u2019d ask him to cover me bc I was shaking uncontrollably from being so cold..At times I passed out on the bathroom or on the couch bc it was so painful, & when I would regain consciousness, I was really drowsy & me waking up would be from a big wave of pain..I was in pain almost all the time & it was hella excruciating. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt this much pain until now.\nI was wailing every time a big cramp would hit & if my boyfriend wasn\u2019t talking, I would ask him to reassure & tell me that everything would be okay in the end..he told me that after this, I would overcome any cramp I would have in the future bc I\u2019m going through this, or that I\u2019ll be okay, etc..I could barely talk at times so the only response I could muster would be a groan. I tried to cry, but there wasn\u2019t anything coming out..so I just wailed and wailed from the pain. There wasn\u2019t anything to help me w it..I tried w the heating pad, but it didn\u2019t relieve anything. I was hyperventilating & didn\u2019t know how to breathe sometimes, so my boyfriend would tell me to breathe like how he was.\nI actually could barely control my bowel movements as well, & it reminded me of how pregnant people would sometimes poop when giving birth bc they couldn\u2019t help it, so I stayed on the toilet as much as I could. When I\u2019d be on the toilet, I couldn\u2019t hold my body up so I laid on top of his trash can w/ a cut out piece of foam that was like a pillow for me on top of it..I remember at one time that I moved my head so the trash can and used it to massage my temple bc my head was also pounding\nI\u2019m really thankful his room\u2019s a master bedroom, otherwise his siblings would\u2019ve seen me..but his little brother came in the room & I wanted to say that I was uncomfortable w him being there, but I was in too much pain to say anything, so he stayed in the room for a couple minutes until my boyfriend told him to leave.\nI got scared the first couple of hours because I wasn\u2019t bleeding, but I started to feel blood in my vagina at 8. My boyfriend left around that time bc his mom told him to get food, & I was scared to be alone >.< I ft\u2019d him though, but I was also in and out of consciousness while he was gone.\nI was in and out of the bathroom, and time went fast & slow at some times. I would ask him to sit on the floor while I was in the bathroom because I wouldn\u2019t want to be alone, and ask him to hold my hand because it helped me emotionally feel better.\nThe last time I regained consciousness was around 2:50 ish, & I wasn\u2019t cold anymore. I had the energy to eat food, because I couldn\u2019t beforehand..if I even drank water, I would throw that up. My throat was hurting because I choked on the vomit & that added to me feeling so crappy the whole time..not the best experience. At 3:10 ish I went to the toilet because I felt like I needed to, and as I was wiping, I felt a really big piece of tissue, & audibly gasped to where my boyfriend could hear..I said \u201coh my gosh. I think this is it. He asked \u201cthat\u2019s the seed?\u201d & I said I think so..I pulled it all the way out, we both looked at it and we were so surprised. He was like \u201cyou did it.\u201d & I bunched my mouth together bc I didn\u2019t know what to say to that. I think I remember saying something like look at what we made & he just kept staring at it. He took pictures & probed it for a little bit, but couldn\u2019t take it anymore & left for a bit. He was kind of disbelief & looked up images of a 8 week old embryo & it matched what I pulled out of me :( the sac was around it, and it was around the size of my hand. The embryo was a lot smaller and in there. I couldn\u2019t stop looking at it, & I felt so numb. I didn\u2019t know how to process it, so I just kept staring at it. We put it in a jar & rn I\u2019m trying to look up how to preserve it in liquid..as strange as it sounds. But..I don\u2019t want to lose it :(\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever choose medical abortion over surgical again, based on how long the process took & how painful it was. I\u2019m still bleeding heavily..I know that I changed my pad over 5 times last night. I had to sleep on the couch because I was bleeding really hard still, & I was actually pretty comfortable sleeping on the couch & I reclined it a bit. I had to put a towel under me just in case I bled out\nI was so exhausted at that point, so I slept pretty easily. I could only sleep for 6 hours, though. I woke up feeling empty, emotionally/physically..\nWhile I was getting ready, I called a crematory & asked if they cremate babies for free, & the worker said yes, but I had to pay some fees even though the cremation was free. I told him that it was 8 weeks & 5 days, & he put me on hold when I told him that. He got back on the phone & said that because it was 8 weeks, the way cremation works is the ashes would be from the bones and cartilage. When I heard that, I broke down because I realized that no bones/cartilage had been developed yet. He then said that there would be no ashes at the end of the cremation, & I told him to give me a moment because I had to cry from that information. He said take all the time you need, to which I replied that I won\u2019t be going through with it, & that I\u2019d be burying it instead when I was able to talk. He said that if I still wanted to go through with it, that I could call, & I said thank you. He said \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re going through this. You\u2019re a strong woman.\u201d I said thank you & bye. When I hung up, I broke down on the floor of my boyfriend\u2019s bathroom. \nI\u2019m really..really sad. I\u2019m not really okay, either. My uterus feels empty to me. My heart aches for it, knowing that it\u2019s not gonna have a future. But, I know that I made the right decision bc both of us weren\u2019t ready to parent and raise it. A couple of days ago, my boyfriend said that he supported my decision, bc he said that it was 100% my decision to actually abort it in the end. I did have fleeting thoughts, but it\u2019s really for the best. We became an angel mom & dad today :( there was a quote that I saw, saying \u201cnow I have to remember you for longer than I\u2019ve known you.\u201d & my heart hurt hearing that, because it\u2019s true. I\u2019m trying to feel my feelings, bc grief denied is grief delayed. I\u2019m gonna take all the time I need, bc this was all so overwhelming & I owe myself that \ud83e\udd0d\nMe being told I\u2019m strong is something I find hard to believe at the moment, bc I feel so exhausted & burnt out. I just hope for the best for me & my boyfriend coming forward from this. We told each other no more nutting inside me, no more plan b as that didn\u2019t work, resulting in this unplanned pregnancy..that he\u2019d pull out every time now. \nRight now, I\u2019m grieving & mourning..I\u2019ll be okay with time.",

              "body": "Hello there! Many people feel a lot of anxiety about sex after an abortion. (Even when a person is totally 100% confident about their decision, an abortion can still be physically traumatic or upsetting, and ultimately sex was what led to it...it can feel like your body betrayed you and it can take a while to build up trust in your body/self again.) \n\nIt might help for her to go through this workbook: [https://www.pregnancyoptions.info/emotional&spiritual.htm](https://www.pregnancyoptions.info/emotional&spiritual.htm) It's about emotional healing after an abortion, it's totally non-judgmental and not religious or anything. There's a section for \"healing partners\", too - highly recommend that you read that! \n\nThis sexual readiness checklist is mainly geared towards people having sex for the first time, but I think it also totally applies to your situation. Maybe you can go over it with your girlfriend to help come up with some ideas of how to be intimate in the meantime and identify things that might help her feel more confident or safe: [http://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships/ready\\_or\\_not\\_the\\_scarleteen\\_sex\\_readiness\\_checklist](http://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships/ready_or_not_the_scarleteen_sex_readiness_checklist)\n\nI also HIGHLY recommend you read something about responsive desire, by Emily Nagowski. It sounds like this is what your girlfriend is describing experiencing now - she can get aroused once foreplay starts, and that's actually totally normal: [https://medium.com/@enagoski/pleasure-is-the-measure-d8c5a2dff33f](https://medium.com/@enagoski/pleasure-is-the-measure-d8c5a2dff33f), [https://www.thedirtynormal.com/post/2010/02/27/do-you-know-when-you-want-it/](https://www.thedirtynormal.com/post/2010/02/27/do-you-know-when-you-want-it/)",

        "body": "Hey guys so I met my girlfriend a little over a month ago and found out a few weeks ago that she had an abortion a few days after we met. It kinda bothered me initially but after putting myself in her shoes I came to the conclusion that I would\u2019ve made the same decision in her situation so it doesn\u2019t bother me or make me see her any different. I still love and care about her a lot. But the thing is she lives with her family so it isn\u2019t often that we would have sex but we have had sex after we thought she stopped bleeding for a while. However the thing is she recently opened up to me saying that before her pregnancy she used to be very horny and would masturbate and want sex all the time which kinda surprised me bc she had been telling me the whole time together that she\u2019s just always had a low sex drive and that she never masturbates and what not. So then I asked her if she actually liked having sex with me or if she was just doing it to make me happy. This was really important to me bc I never want her to feel like she has to have sex with me to make me happy or feel pressured to do it with me.  Once she told me that she kind of didn\u2019t have any interest in sex or touching herself and that she was doing it only bc she thought she had to to make me happy I felt really shitty bc then it meant that all the times we had sex she didn\u2019t want it at all and I feel like she felt obligated to do it. I was kinda upset to begin with bc we had brought up the topic about her never initiating and how it made me me feel undesirable and unattractive before she told me any of this. She said she\u2019ll still have sex with me but I told her that I don\u2019t want to do it if she\u2019s not enjoying it bc then there\u2019s no point bc sex is supposed to be enjoyable for both parties. I seriously contemplated breaking up with her bc I couldn\u2019t continue a relationship where I would never be desired sexually and it was unfair for her to feel obligated to have sex with me when she didn\u2019t want to. I talked to her some more about it and she told me even though she never initiated she would get in the mood and would enjoy it when I did have sex with her which I felt contradicted her saying she had no interest in sex earlier. My question is is she just telling me what I want to hear bc she doesn\u2019t want me to leave her bc she told me she didn\u2019t want to lose me and that she would beg me to stay if I left or does she actually mean that bc I told her the truth is really important to me and she said she was telling me the truth and wouldn\u2019t lie to me about that. Also is her loss of sex drive permanent or will it come back after a while? Sorry if I\u2019m kinda rambling and my post doesn\u2019t make that much sense it\u2019s just I feel sad knowing that she might be lying and doing something she doesn\u2019t want to do just to make me happy.",

I've been paying attention to every single sign of my body, to the point where I almost feel like I'm manifesting symptoms. I suddenly started having to pee when I get in my bed at night the past two days, but is that pregnancy or just my brain obsessed with everything I've read? It's driving me insane.\n\nI'm just not sure how to acquire one at the moment, which is the problem. :( I'm stuck at home with my family in quarantine who don't know I've been sexually active. I can't leave the house--we even had groceries delivered yesterday because my mom is extremely adamant that no one leaves for anything. I think I'm going to order a test on Amazon today, which will come Friday, but I'm terrified they'll find the package first and question me (my mom has even been sanitizing packages when they get to the house before we open them, ugh). I'm just going to have to track the package extremely carefully and be quick and sneaky when it gets to the house to grab it first and run to the upstairs bathroom. This is just the WORST time in my entire life for all this. \n\nAnd if it's positive, I have NO idea what I'll do. My family is staunchly conservative and Christian and they oppose abortion. It's not something that makes me happy either, but I feel like I *have* to do it to keep my current life plan and not subject a child to the immature human being I am, without a boyfriend or anyone for support. I might have to sneak out of the house to get the abortion and deal with the consequences when I get home (just grab the keys and run and have an abortion without any sedative since I have to drive), or maybe I'll talk to my mom about it and hope she understands (she was with me when I got STD tested last year and found out I had been sexually active in the past, and was supportive but upset, but this might cross the line for her--I don't know). And I had sex on 1/29, so I'm probably somewhere around \\~10 weeks along if I were pregnant, which means I don't even have the luxury of time to play with my options. I'm getting my pregnancy test this Friday, 4/3, and I tentatively scheduled an appointment at my local PP for next Wednesday, 4/8 (I'll cancel it if the result is negative). I'm just terrified of COVID-19 closing centers and me ending up shit out of luck, so I wanted a date in hand. \n\nDoes this sound like a good plan? All I've been doing is thinking through this in my head and writing in my diary and going crazy, so any input from someone who's gone through this would be appreciated...",

        "body": " Hi! I'm worried I might be pregnant and would love some advice.  \n\nI've been taking Lo Loestrin Fe for almost 9 months now and I almost never get periods on this pill.  \n\nI had unprotected sex on 1/29--the guy pulled out as well, and then I forgot to take my pill the day after on 1/30, but I took it with my pill the next day. The Lo Loestrin Fe label says that if you miss one blue pill, you don't need a back-up method (otherwise I would've gotten Plan B).  \n\nI did have what I assumed was breakthrough bleeding (very light salmon-pink discharge) for about a week after missing my pill for one day, especially since I really haven't gotten a regular period since I started the pill. But now I'm worried it could have been implantation bleeding from pregnancy (however it started two days after sex, so I don't know if that's possible either).  \n\nI ended up seeing my OB/GYN on February 7th, and I had BV and took one dose of an intravaginal metronidazole the next week. They also performed a urine pregnancy test at the appointment, and it was negative (but this was only 9 days after the unprotected sex).  \n\nI have not had sex since and that one time on 1/29 was the only time I had sex. I'm currently worried, probably irrationally, that I could be pregnant. If that were true, I would be 8 weeks post-conception (10 weeks gestation? not sure since I don't have a LMP) and I don't have any symptoms that I can think of. No sore breasts, nausea or vomiting, weight gain, or anything like that. I did have Strep throat the past week and threw up two times and was a little nauseous, but I'm pretty sure that was the amoxicillin I was taking and have been fine since that cleared up. Maybe some bloating and some fatigue, but it's hard to know if that could be a pregnancy symptom or because of sickness/antibiotics.  \n\nOne thing of note: on February 20th, when I was on my placebo pills of the pack I was on at the time, I started having mild abdominal cramps and spotting dark brown discharge that had a strong unpleasant smell and was very stretchy and mucus-y, almost clot-like, which was different from anything I was used to. And weird because I usually don't get any periods on LoLo. It stopped after a few days and I didn't think anything more of it. I thought it could be related to my treatment of BV with metronidazole a couple of weeks prior. But then I got scared as I saw pictures online of women in early pregnancy having similar sounding discharge.  \n\nI've also been noticing constant thin, white, sometimes slightly clumpy discharge basically every day recently. It's odorless and painless without any itching and hasn't bothered me at all, but I don't know if it could be a sign of pregnancy or not.  \n\nI'm just very scared and worried. With all this COVID-19 crisis, I'm worried I might not find the proper care that I might choose to have if I were pregnant (such as abortion). I'm 22 and currently am in self-quarantine with my strict family that does not know I have been sexually active, so I'm not sure how I can acquire a pregnancy test without their knowledge. We're not leaving the house at all--even had groceries delivered today. I am thinking about Amazon to order a test, however I'm very scared one of my family members could find and open the package first (as they often do to my packages). I wish I had the foresight to get a pregnancy test before all this started. \n\nI just feel awful and guilty for having sex (it was definitely a mistake and I don't have said person in my life anymore and don't want them in my life), but these thoughts of being pregnant are consuming my mind and it's hard to get any studying done with my board exams coming up in May. I just feel I'm going through this completely alone surrounded by my oblivious family and it's hard. Any guidance or reassurance would be appreciated.",

Look into medicaid for health insurance if you don't already have it, and start looking locally for non profit organizations that help people in your situation. Unfortunately many of them are faith based so if you're not religious you may have to just deal with the religion stuff to access the resources, but if you are religious and that is part of the motivation for your decision you may find a lot of emotional and spiritual support in an org like that as well. Your local department of social services or health and human services may have government resources you can access as well like food stamps, low income housing, utility assistance, cash assistance, WIC and chip, and possibly even assistance getting baby furniture or other baby items. Your doctor or even planned Parenthood might be able to refer you to some specific, local resources as well. Wishing you the best \u2764\ufe0f",

I had started to accept that maybe I was infertile. To my surprise I am not but this baby has already gotten so much hate from his/her \u201cdad\u201d, idk if this would be the best decision for the baby. I am very independent, I\u2019ve graduated college, and I have a full time job. I told my boyfriend he doesn\u2019t have to be involved and I wouldn\u2019t care to have this baby alone. But he has opposed because he said that\u2019s very dumb of me to say and that the baby needs to have his/her father. \nI kind of just want to break it off with him and keep my baby because I know if I go through with that abortion I will regret it for the rest of my life. He thinks that it\u2019s so simple like going to the clinic, swallowing a pill and our lives are back to normal. When that is not the case. He already started planning a Colorado trip for winter like nothing. I\u2019ve expressed so many times how this abortion may cause a huge mental toll on me and how I don\u2019t want to do it but I get shut down every time.\nWe have been knowing each other for about 3 years now. The first two and a half years of our relationship were very toxic. We were on and off and eventually cheating happened. After the cheating we broke off completely (about two months ago) and during that time he was seeing someone else and I was also doing my thing. Eventually we came back to each other and we got pregnant two months later we got pregnant. \n\nWhat should I do???",

Then between 6-48 hours later she'll take more pills that cause contractions, and she'll bleed/release the pregnancy over the course of a few days. She may have more bleeding for a while after that.\n\nIt's not clear in your post what your relationship with her is (it seems like it's maybe casual?) but it's great that you want to be supportive. \n\nMedication abortions can be painful, so you could support her by getting her some heating pads (they really help with uterine cramping/contractions), or something like a cozy blanket and some snacks and drinks she likes. Or, you could just ask her what she needs. If I were in her position, I think it would be helpful to hear you say something like, \"I'm so sorry, I feel really bad that the timing means I won't be in town to support you.

So the least you can do is take the financial burden.\n\nIt's also a great idea to stay in touch with her, like you said. I'd text her daily and check in. You could also consider sending her a gift card to a food delivery service or something so that she doesn't have to worry about cooking for herself when she's sick/in pain from the meds.\n\nI'd also consider keeping in touch/being there to listen when/if she needs you after the abortion.

Does the concept of financial abortion now open the door for pro-life men to sue the women to have the baby anyway? Or to receive financial compensation for her aborting the fetus? \n\nI'm going to bring up a radical point here, so bear with me. \n\nIf you don't like the idea of a woman somehow getting pregnant, even after you use a condom, and still yet somehow deciding to keep it even though she knows you don't want it... \n\nGet a vasectomy. \n\nThey're a quick in and out procedure, nearly 100% effective, you can donate sperm now to use later if you decide to have kids (or can sometimes even be reversed). They're less invasive than a woman getting her tubes tied. \n\nWomen's options for birth control are hormonal pills, patches, and IUDs (I'm not even going to get into those side effects), or copper IUDs (let's hope she doesn't work at hobby lobby!) which require surgery. Or condoms, which we've all heard men complain enough about to last a lifetime. \n\nIf we're talking fair and equal, let's go the vasectomy route. \n\nWomen don't ask to have periods more than half their life. Women don't ask to be on birth control for years and years. Unless they are trying to actually have a baby, women don't ask to get pregnant! \n\nI'm sorry, but you'll never be able to convince me that what small % of men are forced to have a baby they don't want, is a harder life than what almost all women have to deal with. \n",

Let me rephrase what I need to be addressed here:\n\nWhy women are not held to the same arguments applied on men? Mainly contraception and abstaining from sex are enough reproductive choices for men, but not enough for women!\nFeminists argue that contraception may fail which is the major reason why, as they believe, abortion should be legal. At the same time, this risk is known in advance to men and this is the reason why financial abortion should stay illegal. Women are so aware about failure risk whether it is male or female contraception, so why there is no uniform, almost gender neutral attitude?",

After I told him it was his his first reaction was to suggest it belonged to one of the other guys I was sleeping with (I wasn\u2019t sleeping with anyone at the time). He rushed me to get an abortion so he wouldn\u2019t have to stress about having a kid so his family wouldn\u2019t find out. I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do but I never really weighed my options I cried every night I was pregnant and I dreamt of having a little family of my own since mines was so broken. I\u2019m dirt poor and in my last year of college I knew having a baby didn\u2019t make since. He never checked in on me about how I was doing or dealing with all of this. He just focused on scrapping together the money to \u201cget it over with\u201d. \n\nI couldn\u2019t tell anyone I was pregnant besides a few close friends and I definitely couldn\u2019t tell my mom. He made me go to the abortion clinic by myself and go through the procedure alone. He cared very little about my emotional and mental well being and eventually after it was all done he ghosted me for months. I saw the ultra sound of the fetus but I wasn\u2019t able to keep it but that image of my could be son or daughter haunts me and I think about it daily. How they would have looked , how they would have acted what it would have been like to have my own child. \n\nI feel like I made a mistake having an abortion but I just don\u2019t have my life together to give my child a life they deserve.

I also want it done as soon as possible to reduce anymore possible hurt I can cause to the baby, but I\u2019m waiting for the clinic to choose a date for me.\n\nLadies who are undergoing abortion or have gone through it, is there anything you did to make the baby comfortable in your womb in a second trimester abortion? I don\u2019t want to cause it more hurt, what can I do to give it a peaceful last few days/week? \n\nI am of course filled with guilt and grief and loss, I already feel my baby the moment I realise I\u2019m pregnant, and think about it often. But I will continue with the abortion as it\u2019s the thing I have to do. \n\nThank you.",

Again showing ignorance.\n\nBut I thought you went to where I was thinking you were going to. \n\nYou are basically saying that a child born with health issues or in poverty wouldn't want to live in that world.\n\nHowever you know that is not true. You as you say have health issues which are severe. If what you say is true. Then you wouldn't be seeking life and instead be seeking to end your own. Which I assume you don't. Therefore I can conclude that you value life more than health problems that might come with that life.\n\nAnd its funny how you assume that I haven't lived through poverty. I have. I had to work since I was 8 years old on a daily basis. Wake up at 3AM-7:30AM on weekdays when out of school. And I had it easy. My cousins had to do the hardest jobs in the dairy. But regardless. No matter how hard our lives where and even those who actually lived through severe poverty as some did in our town. None of them searched for death. None of them cursed their life. It was normal. Once you have an idea of the good life then you will complain about your life not being up to that standard.\n\nBut anyways. Even people that had it worse like slaves did not seek death. Read 20 years a slave and even the bad conditions they had they endured never wishing they were dead. The most hurt people were those that lost family members.\n\nSo what evidence do you have that a person born in poverty or with medical conditions or in orphanages would not have a life worth living?\n\nEven your own life states otherwise. \n",

I will go ahead and point out your ignorance here so that we're even.  ;)  No amount of guilt-tripping is going to change my mind.\n\nAnd...  Are you kidding me?  IF the kid even found a foster home?  The foster care system is fucked to it's *core.*  I know that it's something I wouldn't want to go through and wouldn't put anyone I know through, and my life hasn't been peachy.\n\nFurthermore, this pregnancy would be riddled with medical issues.  I have epilepsy and my seizures have been out of this world since about a week after conception.  I take Keppra and Paxil--two drugs I was advised not to get pregnant on due to severe neural tube and heart defects.  No need to say, \"BUT IT HAPPENED.\"  No shit.  Why don't you be of some help?  I was on birth control and using condoms.  It doesn't get much \"safer\" than that.\n\nNow, as for your blatant misuse of the term \"oxymoron,\" I'm not sure my explanation will help, so I suggest picking up a dictionary (or using Google to search for the definition--did you know you could do that?!  Jeepers!).  Besides the fact that you've tried to elevate your platform by hopping into a deeply philosophical discussion between what a fate, and therefore doom, really are, I feel that the word you've chosen to describe doom is highly inaccurate.  When you're dead, you either go to heaven, hell, or it's lights out.  Ultimately, though, it's a lights-out ending.  That's about as peaceful as it is.  Death is always dirty.  Something is fucking dying.  I've killed before and I know that.\n\nAlso, just because life is the opposite of death doesn't mean you have any valid argument simply from pointing that fact out.  DOHOHOHOHO WOW YOU GOT ME THERE, BUDDY.  No.  How terrible it must be to see such a beautiful world in such black-and-white.\n\nI must ask about the quality of your life.  You must be doing quite well.  You're so pompous it seems so, at least.  To assume that someone who hasn't had enough money to even eat this week would have any mind or heart to keep a fetus that is already suffering from her own health issues (*which will have negative impacts on the pregnancy regardless of any action taken at this point*) is mind-blowing.  This kid would have no life worth living.  I would find that harder to live with, personally.  You seem to think I can just pop the child out, hand it over to someone else, and bee-bop my way on home.  NO.  I would be tormented over wondering what happened to the child for the rest of my life.  This is something that literally makes me vomit when I think about it.\n\nAnyway, I doubt anything got through to you.  You're just as stubborn as I am regarding the matter--at least I'm rational enough to be able to predict that.  We will be butting heads infinitely, so I would appreciate it if you would take your \"advice\" to someone who wants to hear it.  If you truly cared about helping me out, you'd know that shutting the fuck up could be one of the most beneficial things for me.  But you don't care, do you?  ;)",

I mean there is no way of testing for consciousness to my knowledge nor did they provide any test for it.\n\nPlease show how to test for consciousness. How do they know that a being is conscious and not just a souless doll. The study just says that electrical pathways need to be functional for pain. It says nothing about consciousness and it arising. Which is the main point.\n\nI matters nothing if the child can feel pain or not. The same way it doesn't matter whether a woman killed her husband by medication in his sleep. Or she stabbed him while awake. They both take the live of another conscious human being.\n\nThat is the issue and I hope you can agree. That its about taking the life of another being. If there is no being there then there is no issue.\n\nSo think about it. At which point can you say that a body becomes inhabited by a being? And at which point is not?\n\nThe thing that you should be careful about is equating electrical signals to consciousness. Since everything has electromagnetic signals.\n\nSo I still haven found any way of testing for consciousness. Which to my knowledge and broad study of it doesn't exist. If it did we could identify whether a computer program is conscious. Serious discussion about consciousness in AI BTW. Whether a series of electrical signals reacting without a purpose goal is conscious. What makes consciousness and what makes a person be conscious in the body or that he is born in? Science has been futile to even identify consciousness.\n\nInstead its based on asserted philosophy of materialism something that doesn't allow for the basics properties of conscious experience. Such as agency or free will.\n\nImagine if for a small chance the fetus that are being killed are conscious. Then it means that millions of human beings are being killed every year for personal benefit. \n",

So, to me it doesn't seem very barbaric at all in the first two trimesters. In fact, a lot of countries allow abortions up until the last trimester for those reasons. I think that's a reasonable compromise despite my personal opinion that it should be allowed up until the actual birth, because no matter what, I think the woman should have full authority over her body. So, what I want to get at is that I think there's no need to get up in arms about abortion and that, most importantly, it shouldn't solely determine who you vote for, politically, and that investment into actual childcare is a more deserving topic to focus your energy on.",

And never for a second did any of those people many relatives that had to work at 7 years of age to help with the family deem it acceptable that poverty wasn't worth living in.\n\nIf you read people that lived in even worse conditions as in slavery or the holocaust. They still clenched to life at every moment. I don't buy that poverty is justification for abortions.\n\nI do agree with you that abortions on third trimester are basically infanticide. Horrible things.\n\nHowever the issue that I have is when my eyes see things and my conscious tells me that such actions are against human sanctity.\n\nI'm pretty sure you can easily check out pictures of aborted fetuses in the internet at various stages to see what I mean. I just don't find any difference between that and the images of the holocaust, and genocide.\n\nBut I could see your point if we can for sure know that before a certain point a fetus is a souless doll. Meaning just a puppet without an actual being to observe and experience like we do. I think that is what the issue rest on. Sadly the emergence of consciousness is something that is outside of scientific understanding. So there is no way of settling that issue. ",

Prohibiting it by law just drives it underground and cause *a lot* of unnecessary suffering, more than it's worth. You know what would *actually* reduce abortions? Investing into childcare, healthcare, mental health, sex ed, contraceptives, education, free higher education and paid sick and maternity leave. Not to mention that for the first 2 terms, a fetus barely even has a neuro-system, can't feel pain and isn't viable, so the only really gruesome thing are third term abortions, which are only a *tiny* fraction of actual abortions.

Here is where I don't really get the point you see the woman was still going to have to give birth and while I realize that the fetus would be a lot smaller and easier to birth at this point I can't think of many things quite so disgusting as a small corpse floating around inside of me and then delivering *shudder*. I am just curious why not give birth and give the baby up for adoption if you are already in a situation where you will have to go through birth anyway? No judgement just curiosity.

Feel free to private message me with questions or concerns or even if you just need support! I\u2019m very comfortable sharing my MA story so also feel free to ask questions :) \n\n1. Planned parenthood has a text line, you just text PPNOW to 774636, their hours are online! \n\n2. For those under 18, planned parenthood has a \u201c take charge \u201c program for free healthcare for minors wether that be abortion, plan b, std/pregnancy testing, or birth control. \n\n3. Planned parenthood also has funding for those over 18 getting abortions, for instance mine was only $200. Call your local clinic for details \n\n4. Buying abortion pills online for those in Washington state or New York https://www.heyjane.co/abortion/pills?googleSearch=true&utm_source=google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=13615570025&utm_content=123568835923&utm_term=find%20abortion%20clinic%20near%20me&gclid=CjwKCAjwuvmHBhAxEiwAWAYj-EnVnAJPiOWB1WFiraoPBFdNhjKHhR1pKOOXKRD1BPPAWZIYZqMzKBoCIIgQAvD_BwE \n\n5. This website will help you find a clinic in your area https://www.abortionfinder.org\n\n6. Questioning what to do? I was recommended to make a pro and con list when I was considering my options, think about your lifestyle changes, your relationships, your financial state and living situations. Take every aspect of life into consideration. \n\n7. Here is a website for funding if you\u2019re worried about cost. https://abortionfunds.org/need-abortion/\n\n8. If you are a minor or 18+, on your parents insurance and worried they can see anything if you use it, I was told they can. Even if you\u2019re 18+ they have access to see what is being used in their insurance. I called my insurance and asked them to make it to where my parents can\u2019t see and they told me that wasn\u2019t possible, contact your insurance and see if it\u2019s possible on yours but definitely check first before using if you\u2019re worried about your parents seeing anything! \n\n9.

I knew in my heart I did not want to have a baby and be tied to this man forever. Looking back on it, it all seemed so bizarre. \n\nHe refused to come to my ultrasounds because it \u201churt too much\u201d. He played video games during my abortion (via pill). He also complained about going to get me food because I was hungry, but couldn\u2019t drive even if I wanted to. I paid for the food btw.

I believe no matter what, it is a woman\u2019s decision at the end of the day. It\u2019s her body. Pregnancy and motherhood can be extremely rough. \n\nI don\u2019t believe in forcing a man to be a father. If he states he is not ready to be a father and a woman continues to have the baby, then that is her choice. I might judge him a little bit if he completely abandons his child, but I wouldn\u2019t blame him for being resentful towards the woman he got pregnant. It\u2019s a complicated situation tbh.

I have also had a harrowing experience with a gyno visit where an IUD insertion went wrong, and the \"professionals\" at the chain gyno attempted to use a defective device to insert my IUD and put me through the pain of childbirth for 25 minutes. I'm not over that to this day... but what was worse was the decade of transvaginal ultrasounds that followed when I was getting massive ovarian cyst after massive ovarian cyst. I had undiagnosed endometriosis and underwent transvaginal ultrasounds and pelvic exams with every new cyst.   \n\n\nI can empathize with the discomfort and pain. You are *not* alone and your feelings are valid. Let me say that again: You are NOT alone and your feelings are VALID!  \n\n\nI have since had surgery and am on a few different medications to try and keep my endometriosis in check... but every year I have to go to the gyno for my yearly exam, and every year when they take my blood pressure before that exam it is through the roof. That is due to the trauma. The memory of so many appointments where I had a painful instrument shoved inside me and rooted around while I squirmed and cried, and the physicians acted like I was just a dead frog they were dissecting. Even in the instances where there were no pain, the \"just fingers\" exams, I didn't want to be there. I didn't want strangers looking at my private parts and putting their fingers in me. At the time I was even nervous about people seeing my unkempt downstairs business because I didn't have the energy to landscape... so that they would not only be seeing my privates but *touching* them and going *inside* me? It was a nightmare.   \n\n\nI'm sorry that got so long winded but I feel so passionately about this and have so much empathy for you. My point is: You are NOT alone. It is OK to acknowledge how such exams make you feel, and it is NOT your fault if the caregivers/physicians are snotty, rude or bad at what they do. It is a sign of a poor physician if they do not, first and foremost, treat you like a human being. The best thing you can do (in future for such exams) is:\n\n1. Acknowledge that your feelings are valid, and that there is nothing wrong with feeling that way\n\n2. Share with your physicians ahead of time how such exams make you feel (if you have the courage I strongly recommend that you do)\n\n3. Do NOT blame yourself for a PHYSICIANS shortcomings. You need to be your own advocate. This is much easier said than done, yes, but shitty doctors/medical professional will continue to be shitty doctors/medical professionals if they don't know that they are being, cold/callous/ignorant to your needs. You are a human being, not a case. \n\nTake care of yourself and your mental well being. You are not alone and your feelings are valid. Thank you for sharing your truth with us.

If smoking could cause miscarriage then we wouldn\u2019t need abortions. The early miscarriages are almost always because the embryo failed to start developing properly, but please try not to read too much into that because it could have nothing to do with your childhood chemo. If you do end up struggling with infertility then you can cross that bridge when you\u2019re ready to have a baby. And guess what?

You asked for advice, and you\u2019re going to get it. \nThe entire way you talk about her and her experience is incredibly disrespectful and not compassionate. Her lack of desire to have sex with you is probably due in large part to you being an asshole. You admitted to being an asshole through the process, but are neglecting to see that you\u2019re currently being an asshole during her healing as well. She sounds traumatized, and rightfully so. You don\u2019t \u201cgo back\u201d after trauma. You evolve. You change. Sometimes for the better, sometimes not. You need to let go of this idea of who she was or who you think she \u201cis\u201d and support the person she has become, as a result of what she went through. She needs support. She deserves better than you\u2019re currently giving her. I don\u2019t think she is the only one who would benefit from some professional help, but you as well. You could likely benefit from a professional, to point out all these toxic thoughts and behaviors. She deserves more than this. If you talk like this to strangers, I can\u2019t even imagine how you treat her. Do better. Educate yourself. See a therapist, even virtually. Be empathetic to the poor girl. Time means nothing when nothing has changed. She endured trauma and hasn\u2019t had the correct support. She\u2019s likely on a loop. No wonder she doesn\u2019t want to have \u201cnon vanilla\u201d sex with you. You\u2019re lucky she lets you touch her at all. She can\u2019t get wet? Take a hint.

We had our abortion 3 years ago, we just weren\u2019t in a place in our relationship or life to be able to support a child fully so we made decision to abort after 10 weeks.\u00a0\n\nmy wife hasn\u2019t been back to normal yet, before she would sexually aroused easily, would get noticeably moist down there, and would always be talking about hammering it out in public areas. after the procedure shes become as vanilla as she can get. When talking about how she has changed she always mentions how the procedure fucked her up, I\u2019ve heard that line so much I\u2019m just wondering if there is anything to do to get the old wife back. \n\nDuring this whole procedure I was an asshole. After we discovered she was pregnant, I distanced myself from the decision because I wasn\u2019t ready for a child. Both her and I had talked about both of us not wanting children early when dating so we knew this wasn\u2019t in our life plans. Regarding the decision though I left it up to her to decide to adopt or raise it or abort.  \n\nI don\u2019t know much about the procedure, but I know it didn\u2019t go according to plan. First off, I wasn\u2019t there because I was had classes I had to teach and substitute teachers don\u2019t exist at my school. From what I have heard in broken conversations was that the parasite was large and took a lot of scraping to get out. Wife commented this hurt a lot. The scraping also removed part of uterus walls? And so doctors were not sure when this is going to heal\u2026 if ever.  After the procedure she was kicked out of her private room and into the in the waiting room for 3 hours while I was in a meeting and couldn\u2019t chat. \n\nShe worked the next day, the doctor said to rest for a week but we were poor and had an abortion to pay for so she went to work in her preschool. That weekend I was out of town for a few days which meant I couldn\u2019t support her as much as I should.  Anytime we try to go back to this event mentally I reflect on how much of an asshole I was, and she reflects on the procedure and how she didn\u2019t listen to the doctors and got fucked up in the process so were both hiding some shame which we haven\u2019t addressed.\n\nSince then things have not improved, her period is irregular. Sometimes it\u2019s bright red, other times it\u2019s corpse black, sometimes it flows like a monsoon, other times it\u2019s like before the procedure.  I don\u2019t know what this means. \n\nI have suggested that we should go to a doctor, but now with Covid she is afraid of hospitals, personally I think she is just afraid of discovering what really happened (because she didn\u2019t want to go before COVID either). I have attempted to convince her that we need to see what\u2019s wrong so that we can find out how to fix it but I haven\u2019t broken down that wall yet. Every time we think about it it brings shame to both of us.    \n\n\nquestions:\n\n\u2018how does this procedure affect sexual arousal in the future? is this a mental thing or something more serious?\n\nwhat can I do in the future to assist in helping my wife heal?\n\nlove your thoughts on the Matter",

I told my partner I\u2019d support her too, we had an abortion booked but I had my doubts from the beginning. Then one night, I felt a kick and my heart broke. I didn\u2019t want to tell her how badly I wanted that child now that it was already inside her, and knowing that they\u2019d be a child in 5-6 months if we didn\u2019t interfere hurt me deeply. It\u2019s very hard not to think of it like your child when you want it. I got distant from her because I didn\u2019t want to break down in front of her and push her towards what I wanted. She pressed me on and on and just begged me to tell her how I really feel, and I told her. Now I have a 2 year old son. That\u2019s why we get distant.",

I thought I had found the one. Recently he has admitted that he would love to be a father, he just didn\u2019t realize it before he met me. He was in a very toxic long-term relationship before me, and he has now realized it\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t want kids at all.. he just didn\u2019t want them with her.\n\nI recently found out my birth control failed, and I\u2019m VERY pregnant. I have had absolutely no symptoms the entire time. I took a pregnancy test once I started noticing.. my stomach starting to bulge. \n\nI\u2019m absolutely terrified of what I am going to have to go through, since it\u2019s too late for d/c. I\u2019m terrified of what my body is going through. It seems like every day my stomach is getting bigger. I can feel it...moving. It keeps me up at night. I\u2019m so exhausted and my entire body is in pain. My boyfriend is the only one who knows about it, and it\u2019s going to stay that way. I can\u2019t deal with the shame, or the fear of what anyone else might think about me for going through with this.\n\nWhen I found out how far along I was, I tried discussing the next steps with my boyfriend as I just wanted to hear his thoughts. He told me it didn\u2019t matter how he felt or what he wanted. He said it was 100% my decision and he\u2019d support whatever I decided to do. \n\nThe thing is, he\u2019s become so distant. He says nothing when I try to vent about what\u2019s going on with my body. He eventually told me he doesn\u2019t want to hear about any of it. I feel completely and utterly alone. I\u2019m scared/anxious and I have no one to turn to. He felt the baby kick once and now he won\u2019t touch me out of fear that he\u2019ll feel it again. \n\nI understand that he\u2019s going through this too. But acting like nothing is going on and basically is really fucking me up mentally. I feel like I am with a complete stranger.\n\nNot sure why I\u2019m posting this.. I guess I just needed to get all of this out.",

I didn't want to have to bring in a child to a situation that wasn't ideal and I didn't want any resentment towards my would-have been baby from any side, I wanted it to be a positive experience all around. \n\nwhen I found out I was pregnant I was excited and looking forward to bringing my own human into this Earth, one I could love and raise and be a mother to. This was my first time being pregnant and I gave it up. \n\nNow I feel so fucked up for actually going through with the abortion, it's extremely hard for me to cope and I hate myself for it. it feels like I will never get over this, I'm having such a hard time idk what to do I'm breaking down each time I think about it. \n\nAlso, the abortion was the WORSE pain I've ever felt and that topped it off for me. \n\nI'm trying to get over it but I can't, I just wish it would leave my mind and I'll never have to think about it.

A good majority of the relationship has been fighting, just simple things we don\u2019t see eye to eye on, I\u2019m a clean freak and have spotless things, while her, you can\u2019t even see the floor of her car. She has a daughter from a previous relationship who is about to turn 5 so I initially attributed some of that messiness to that but it\u2019s more of her lifestyle I\u2019ve come to find out.\n\nShe has been on birth control the entire relationship but about 2 weeks ago she informed me that she is with child. Of course I\u2019m freaked out by it. At one point I want to start a family with her but at the other point, the abortion offer sounds like just a simple way out. To be entirely honest I would say at least half the relationship has been nonsense fighting. But the other half is amazing. Mostly fighting about the discipline of the daughter, bedtimes, routines, stuff of that nature that she refuses to change. She doesn\u2019t believe in properly disciplining her kid, and lets her run around like a raped ape. No consistent bedtime, drinks pop all the time, stuff of that nature.\n\nI will admit I have been kind of \u201cdistant\u201d with her just because I\u2019ve been processing all my feelings. We\u2019ve still talked and she understands it. Today she called me and said she has scheduled an abortion for the 11th. If we go through it she wants to have nothing to do with me afterwards (rightfully so). I would be hurt if we broke up but sometimes I do get the feelings that we are not the ones for reach other just because we have such different viewpoints on things. On the other hand we can cancel the appointment and go forward with having the child but I can\u2019t 100% guarantee that we would even still be together 8 months from now. For the sake of the child and our lives I\u2019m not sure what to do.\n\nTL;DR: My (23M) Girlfriend (25F) is knocked, gave me the option of abortion and entirely breaking up, or having the child and staying together. Not sure what to do.",

        "body": "We started having problems in our relationship because he feels that I should have no contact with any man outside of him. I already have a 6 yr old son and his father started coming around, I have no interest in my sons father but my current feels that he is trying to win me back. I don\u2019t see how, I honestly just feel like he just wants to build a relationship with his son. My sons father told me he was not ready to be a father and I knew I\u2019d be a single mother, at the time I did not agree with abortions and decided to keep my son anyways. After dealing with the stress of single mother hood I have a different point of view. My current doesn\u2019t want me on social media, dressing a certain way or interacting with any men that aren\u2019t him or my brothers and dad. He\u2019s made me cut off all my male friends because he cut off his female friends and says I am disrespecting him for even liking a post on social media. He has three phones and is always texting but has a problem if I am on my phone for more than 10 minutes. \n\nI do dress a bit provocatively so I did throw/give away those things, and I do have a problem with escapism when I am stressed out I stress scroll on the phone. But it has gotten to a point where I can\u2019t even have a different opinion than him because he feels that I am combating him. He constantly tells me about how so many women want him but the second I talk about ANY man in my life he gets mad. I am 29 and he is 37. He says that I am the problem because he has only had 4 relationships in his life (but he has a lot of casual sex and admitted that a woman has to play the role of his girl friend for 6 months before he claims them) and I\u2019ve had 4 relationships including him in the past 10 years. I don\u2019t do casual sex and he threw in my face that I\u2019ve been abused because I am the problem (I have restraining orders on 2 exes because of stalking and death threats and one of them was extremely verbally abusive). \n\nHe\u2019s a vegan and wants me to follow suite, I cannot eat the amount of food or what I want to eat because he will get mad and say I\u2019m going to give myself stomach issues.. I\u2019ve lost 20 lbs in a month while pregnant and I have dreams almost every day that I am going to die. That has made me very depressed along with feeling like I am losing my freedom to be myself. Somehow, and for some reason, he wants me to stay pregnant with his child even though he told me I disgust him and that he was never going to get back with me. I told him I will not have a baby with another man unless we are getting married and staying together. I don\u2019t want to deal with two men that are going to be free to do what they want while I am stuck raising children by myself. He currently lives in LA and I live in New England area so he wouldn\u2019t even be around. \n\nEverything was perfectly fine until I started voicing my opinion and telling him how I started to feel like this relationship is getting a bit controlling. I do have online classes so he thinks I am only on social media when I am on the phone or computer.  I have no social life because he has isolated me from everyone even my family- but he does not understand why I want to get an abortion. When I told him about it he just told me that another man probably paid for it and called me a hoe and blocked me. \n\nThere\u2019s no history of either one of us cheating, at least that I know of- and he did not put his hands on me or argue in front of my son. Which I can appreciate but I still am hurt because I usually don\u2019t agree with abortion but I feel like for my future and safety this is what I have to do. I guess I just need some advice on the situation because I have been so depressed lately. I have my appointment on Friday for the procedure. I\u2019m just hurt I guess and have no one to talk to about this situation. Am I wrong for this? Was there something I could have done differently? What can I do to cope with the stress? I\u2019ve never been so heart broken before and these feelings are so new to me.",

From my perspective we are currently working on our marriage, our 3 year old struggles to communicate with us and we can't start ABA therapy for him until the end of June which is so drawn out and it's stressful because I want my 1st born and me yo eventually connect. He doesn't even say sentences. It took him until this point to actually show interest and his little brother. My 2nd pregnancy I had marital issues with which heightened even more during my labor in which I banned my hubby from the delivery room. That to me said where we were in our marriage. I went into labor silently and didn't even tell my family. Bottom line is my pregnancy hormones and thoughts made me shut people out. I'm just not ready to go through that with working on my marriage and I want to focus on my 2 kids I have right now. Things can change 6 months from now and I think it would be best to try again then. I want to enjoy my last pregnancy from the beginning to the end. My hubby of course from his view doesn't see it this way. He believes we should just get them all out of the way and it would be easier on us both BUT he's not the one carrying the baby or going through this mentally as he's not affected with hormones. My kid may be better connecting with me in 6 months with therapy. Our marriage may be in better standing then.\n\nHowever my husband has said if you do this, our marriage will be strained...which we were never great and I would rather be happily pregnant than forced to be pregnant and dreading it. It's my body. He also feels I will eventually be okay with this. How does he know that? I made it clear I don't want this right now and he makes this about him.",

Then the nurse ended the message by saying once the pregnancy was confirmed, I could call a secondary number provided and they would assist. The message was very curt and I felt like I didn't get what I needed.\n\nI've called a slew of people and most of them have been so cold toward me when answering my questions. The first person at the 800 number told me I would need to wait for my dr. to confirm the request and to expect a call later in the day. No one ever called so I called the number on the back of my card and that person told me the request was submitted incorrectly. Gee, thanks. Then once the request was submitted, nurse from dr's office gave me a call and was super short about scheduling a test, telling me I needed to do a urine test first and from there if it came back positive, I would get a blood test done. The nurse then told me to call the secondary number provided in the message to \"take care of it\".\n\nWell, I don't want to wait until Monday to get a urine test and then get shuffled around some more (that's what it feels like from them). So I started looking online and it turns out I can do a self-referral to Planned Parenthood. I spoke to someone who was so compassionate and fully explained the difference between MA and SA and the cost without insurance (approx. $600). I let the rep know I was about 6 weeks along and I wanted to go with an MA so the rep booked my appt. for tomorrow at 9:35. They took my KP insurance info and told me to expect a call later in the day  to confirm cost. \n\nI ended up getting a call this afternoon telling me the cost was $768 WITH my coverage.\n\nTo say I'm shocked is the nicest way I can put that. I am at a loss as to why it would be so much more expensive. \n\nAt this point, I am highly discouraged from going into my appointment tomorrow and really just wish I could go through this whole process with the guidance of my primary doctor. I don't understand the push for this outside referral. I can \\*barely\\* make it to $600, have very little wiggle room on my one credit card, and paying the $768 with my insurance coverage is entirely out of the question.\n\nI've been looking at self-administering but I feel like I should come up with some kind of plan. Luckily, I work a 4 day week and have 3 days to myself to go through with this plus some sick time and PTO, but is it necessary to get an ultrasound to confirm how far along I am? My primary isn't even available for me to ask without booking a telehealth appointment several weeks out.\n\nMy partner and I can comfortably afford $300 without going into debt or setting us back on bills, so we could technically go with purchasing the pills online thanks to all of the resources linked in this sub.\n\nI just want some additional support/guidance if anyone can spare the time. My partner is the only other person (ok, beside our dog) whose support I have and we are both big, nervous wrecks. He is being tough, but I'm just a hot, emo, hormonal mess.\n\nThis sub is incredible and I'm so grateful to have stumbled across it.",

              "body": "You can search for therapists who are progressive. You can be honest before even a meeting to suss out whether they would be non-judgmental.\n\nThey can help you frame it differently and use techniques to help you manage your anxiety, circular thinking, and intrusive thoughts. You are in mourning, possibly PTSD.\n\nIts also probably time to leave your partner, he isn't right for you as you said, he cannot understand what is going on with you, and he is a daily reminder of the thing causing you pain.\n\nOne thing to remember is despite what you think, you may have regretted having the child. There is simply no way to know for sure. My friend regrets it, she is overwhelmed and miserable every day. She wanted a kid at some point, but tying herself to a partner who isn't right is proving to be incredibly isolating. She would have had an abortion if she had the ability to redo. \n\nYou can still be a great parent someday, knowing its the right time, with the right person. Give yourself some credit that you understood it wasn't the right time. Even if you cannot totally articulate why right now.\n\nIn my opinion, thinking of life as a potential gift is contrary to nature. Sometimes people get abortions. Sometimes people have miscarriages. Sometimes babies get really sick and die. Sometimes mothers die in childbirth. Sometimes accidents happen. Same with all kinds of animals. It's harsh to some people, but true and each potential life is not precious in the grand scheme of existence. Its not endowed with inherent worth otherwise our bodies would have miscarriages, sometimes as a way of self-preservation and prevention of complications. Once someone is born we as a society should do our best to care for them, anything prior to that is not endowed with inherent worth. That doesn't mean your feelings of loss aren't valid. But its okay that the offspring you chose not to have wasn't meant to be here.",

There's a couple of options linked in the wiki here, but if you do go with an individual therapist you can ask them upfront if they deal with issues on \"abortion/pregnancy\" over the phone while scheduling and gauge their reaction based on that. There are therapists out there that deal with those issues in a very non judgemental way, but the last thing I'd want to have is for you to find yourself in a prolifers office and be shamed for what you did. You don't deserve that, and you shouldn't feel ashamed for taking take of yourself.\n\nSending much support to you, and hope you find peace \ud83d\udc9c",

I\u2019m in my early 30s and have always wanted kids: I\u2019ve been obsessed with kids forever but the second I found out I was pregnant I was crushed. I ended up going through with the abortion even though it tore me apart. I felt like I didn\u2019t have a \u201cgood\u201d reason to do it. I am ok financially, my  boyfriend was supportive, my family would have been supportive I just didn\u2019t feel like it was the right time, it wasn\u2019t the ideal situation but Is it ever the ideal situation? Anyways so now I am really struggling I feel so lost and my boyfriend was supportive but I think he\u2019s getting a little annoyed? He\u2019s just kind of like ok time to get over it it\u2019s been done and nothing you can do now. He doesn\u2019t realize that it\u2019s all I think about every day all day. The what ifs kill me. Now I feel like I\u2019ve ruined my life I never want kids because I\u2019m so traumatized and I feel like I\u2019ll always wonder what their sibling would have been like or why did you get to live but your sibling didn\u2019t. I know maybe crazy thoughts but I can\u2019t help it. I know therapy would be beneficial but it again terrifies me because this is such a controversial topic and I am so fearful I won\u2019t get someone who would be helpful without being judgmental. Also, my family who would have been extremely supportive in me keeping my child  I know would be so disappointed in my decision that I ended up making. I feel so weird having this huge secret from the people closest to me and can\u2019t help but think about angry they would be if they knew so I have put a lot of distance between us just because of how I know they would feel if they knew. It is a terrible feeling and I don\u2019t know how to deal with that. I don\u2019t know I\u2019m just struggling and wondering if anyone can relate.",

This a long story so please keep with me, i go in to detail and give full context. I hope that my story can be informative to others thinking about having an abortion or who have already had one. I also hope that in sharing it on here i can find some support and maybe some sort of closure.   \n\n\nThis is probably one of the most difficult things I have ever written about. And although it has been some years now \u2013 the wound has not healed. But it has, at least, been successfully repressed. Some things are better not to be thought about; some wounds simply cannot be healed.\u00a0\n\nHowever, here is my story for you. And as usual, my personal abortion was a lot more weird, painful, and dramatic than what most women go through (not to belittle the painful experiences of others). Surely, an abortion will always be a memory best forgotten, it is never an easy decision or experience. But it rarely goes like this:\n\nI had just arrived back in Bangkok after abruptly ending my studies in Psychology and Human Kinetics and Ergonomics. I had been in a relationship, with a newly adopted dog living and studying in South Africa. I couldn\u2019t stay any longer. I couldn\u2019t continue living that life. I missed my old happy hippie single life in Thailand too much. This longing haunted me in my sleep.\n\nSouth Africa was definitely something else, a very sad, yet beautiful country. I was living in Grahamstown, a grey, rainy place named after a brutal coloniser, and studying at Rhodes University. What a strange thing to go back to university at 28! I did love it there for a time. I loved having a purpose, a goal. I loved the knowledge I acquired, wanting to be the best and achieving it. I loved making new friends and figuring out a place that was so different from anything I had ever experienced.\n\nIt was dangerous. Every house had alarm systems, windows covered in burglar bars. It was there that I learned what White Privilege means. But in the end, it wasn\u2019t for me. I was in the wrong place, in a society that was too closed-minded and in a relationship that I didn\u2019t want to be in any more. Leaving South Africa felt like breaking out of a prison I had put myself in. Leaving South Africa also meant leaving Daniel, a man that had just asked me to marry him. This was all a radical shift but I had yet to realise what big changes awaited me.\n\nI spent the last weeks of my stay in Grahamstown by myself as Daniel went back to Australia to work. I spent these nights either on Ritalin in the library, or fucking a handful (or two handfuls) of guys. I had spent a year and a half being monogamous even though Daniel and I were in a polyamorous relationship on paper. *So let\u2019s just say I went a bit wild after he\u2019d left.* I had relatively few options in South Africa but there was enough room to play with.\u00a0\n\nDaniel and I were one of those healthy couples. We trained every day, we ate clean. No drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes. So when he left, everything turned upside down. Inside out. Life became exciting again. Wild. Chaotic. Toxic. How fucking good is it to be single???\n\nAnd in that mess of drugs and sex, it happened. Two condoms broke. With two different guys. You know, It does happen. Condoms do break if you\u2019re too rough or not wet enough or you ignorantly use coconut oil as a lubricant not knowing it causes condoms to break. *And then at other times, you don\u2019t even put one on in the first place, or the guy that fucks you from behind sneakily pulls it off.* Until then, I had never gotten pregnant. Even though it could have and perhaps should have happened many times. It\u2019s pretty much a miracle that it didn\u2019t.\n\nSo I thought it would stay this way. With the same na\u00efvet\u00e9 that allowed me to walk the street in the middle of the night without fearing danger or rape; I believed that I was especially protected in some way. I believed the world was safe and people were good. Then life decides it\u2019s time for that na\u00efve young girl to wake up. She must learn the hard way so she can become strong.\n\nWith these two condom mishaps in mind, I was on my way to a clinic in Bangkok to get tested. I was shitting myself thinking I\u2019d caught something. There was no doubt in my mind that I could have gotten chlamydia but I was sincerely worried about having contracted HIV. *It was South fucking Africa after all*.\n\nI arrived at the clinic but it was closed for a public holiday. I felt like I needed to be proactive and I had a bit of pain in my uterus. So I went to 7-11 and bought a pregnancy test, one of those I had bought probably 50 times before. I pissed on it in the public toilet of a park. I didn\u2019t take it too seriously. It was more of a routine thing to do. And when I saw two pink stripes I laughed and told myself it was probably a manufacturing mistake. A bit concerned however, I rushed home to my friends where I was staying and bought another test on the way.  \nTwo stripes again.\n\nI sank into the sofa as images of last week\u2019s shenanigans fought for attention in my mind but I couldn\u2019t really focus on anything\u2026\n\n\u2026The day before, I had just come back from a crazy trip to Pattaya with some new girlfriends. We went to a gay strip club and I was called on stage, sat on a chair and ten guys with erect penises wearing cockrings circled around me pretty much fulfilling my earliest gangbang fantasies. There I was in the middle and wasted as fuck. So I did what any one would do in that moment. I took the chance and sucked them all off. We went to a normal strip club afterwards and I went on stage pretending to be able to dance, hit on one of the strippers\u00a0 almost to the point of harassment and then blacked out.\n\nI thought of Kgala, a thin, black, handsome and very smart socio-politically active young skater kid who cheated on his girlfriend with me.\n\nWhen we realised the condom had broken, after he came inside of me, I ran to the shower to clean myself, desperately hoping it would help. When I came back to the bedroom he stood at the window pointing at a rainbow. I joked and said, I feel like this is a sign a baby was just created. I laughed.\u00a0\n\n**But it wasn\u2019t all that funny anymore.**\n\nI thought of Chris, my drug dealer lover and his pretty face.\n\nA law student so high on his own supply that often I couldn\u2019t even understand what he was saying. I thought of the night I ended up in the bathtub with him and two other guys. I thought of him then fucking me in the shower and in someone\u2019s bedroom. He took so long to come, it felt like a never-ending story. Until the excitement was gone and I just wanted it to be over. And when it finally was, he pulled out to tell me the condom broke. It didn\u2019t feel good at all, that moment just felt dark.\n\nI thought of Daniel, who I\u2019d left heart-broken in South Africa, trying to sell our car and get the papers ready for the dog we\u2019d adopted so he could take him to Australia\u2026\n\n\u2026I thought of all the drugs I\u2019d taken, it was probably some of the wildest and unhealthiest few weeks of my entire life. A grand finale of self destruction that lead to\u2026 **you**\u2026\u2026And finally I thought of you.\n\nI touched my belly and a feeling of love overcame me that cleared all other thoughts from my mind and finally, finally I cried.\u00a0\n\nWould you be light caramel brown or white and tall? Would I raise you by myself on the beach in Thailand? Who would help me? How would I educate you? Would you be healthy? Was this real or was it a nightmare I\u2019d wake up from in a second? Its a strange feeling when you\u2019re at a point in your life where you only have questions and not a single answer.\u00a0\n\nTo be really, really sure I went to the hospital to get a pregnancy/every-STD-exisitng-in-the-world test. I had to wait an hour and when the doctor called me in, he told me he had good and bad news\u2026\n\n**Bad news??????**\n\nHe said, \u201cThe bad news is you have chlamydia\u201d. Thank God I thought, \u201c\u2026and the good news is you\u2019re pregnant\u201d.\n\nI cried again and told him he got it mixed up. Chlamydia is the good news and the pregnancy is the bad news but he didn\u2019t get it. I listed the drugs that I had taken in the last weeks and he promised me the baby would be fine. I didn\u2019t believe him. I got a picture of the ultrasound and a tablet against the chlamydia.\n\nI walked home through Bangkok\u2019s smoggy, dirty streets, sweating and crying. It was real. You were real. It was a nightmare. No, hell. I was in hell.\u00a0\n\nBack at the apartment, I called my mum and her first reaction was anger. \u201cHow could that have happened?\u201d, she said. \u201cHow could it not be Daniel\u2019s?\u201d. And she did what she\u2019s always done all my life \u2013 she slut shamed me. Not that it would have any kind of effect, she\u2019s done all my life and look at what I\u2019ve become.\n\nShe probably didn\u2019t do it hoping to change me but it was just how she learned to react to an extremely sexually liberated woman. Even though she\u2019s a feminist, an alternative witch, politically rather than sexually liberated. Maybe she hated men too much to have lots of sex with them. Or maybe she was jealous of my sexual freedom. After her sadness and anger had calmed down she told me that although she normally wouldn\u2019t suggest it, she thought I should have an abortion.\n\nI was disappointed, but I thanked her for the advice I didn\u2019t want to hear and the insult I didn\u2019t need. Quite shocked having not received what I needed from my mum, I called about 6 more people whose opinion I trusted, only to find out that everyone said exactly the same. I need to have an abortion.\n\nNo one believed you should be born? What the fuck was wrong with them, cold-hearted assholes. They had no faith in us? How could they all think like this? It\u2019s because they didn\u2019t carry you in their bloody bodies like I did. All of this while the hormones hCG and estrogen rushed through my blood making my skin glow and my tits swollen and sore. Everything very soft including my mind. I was really really pregnant and it felt\u2026. Kinda good. It felt yummy. And I felt so much love, it would be impossible to kill you. Even if everyone said it was the right thing to do.\n\nI went out and bought chocolate cake and a pink dress. Might as well\u2026 this is when the most confusing and painful few days of my life began. Days of considering whether to keep a baby whose father I didn\u2019t even know or somehow find a way to have an abortion in a place where it seemed close to impossible...",

        "body": "Today marks one year since I had my abortion. Thank you for listening to my story. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\nI was a senior in highschool (17) and I was quite the band nerd. I performed in many honour bands and even attended band camps in the summer. Band was the one thing that truly made me happy and I had the best band teacher ever. He was big role model in my life. \n\n\nI applied to a fast food chain in the neighbouring town to mine. A couple of friends already were working there so I thought why not. I was saving the money for a new clarinet. The interviewer, the boss, was a 24 year old man. He Immediately liked my bubbly personality and quickly grew fond of me because I wasn\u2019t basic. He told me that he could give me a raise if I said yes to a date with him. I thought this would be a win win situation. A few dates later i said yes when he asked me to be his girlfriend. \n\n\nAfter a couple weeks of dating him I found out how manipulative and abusive he was to me. Often he would tell me he\u2019ll fire me if I don\u2019t let him look at my phone and tell him the password. He would also yell at me and embarrass me at work to my coworkers, by making weird sexual references to the guys but if I did it to anyone else he\u2019d spaz. I remember crying myself to sleep a lot, but he would often apologize and blame me for the issues. He would make it up to me by purchasing gifts for me. I started to believe that I was worth a pair of LULULEMON leggings. \n \n\nFlash forward to Valentine\u2019s Day. My friends and family completely hated this guy because of the age gap and because of how rude he was to me. He didn\u2019t care though and he told me that we can fight through the hate and I don\u2019t need the support from friends and family. He picked me up from school in the middle of the day and took me out for lunch. After we drove home and he made it very clear how much money it costed him and how he had plenty of gifts at his apartment. Since it was Valentine\u2019s Day, he told me that we needed to have sex, and when I said no he kept begging and making me feel bad because he spent money on me. I gave in and opened my legs for him. He came in me.  Immediately I started crying my eyes out yelling at him. He left me at his place to go to the pharmacy to pick up planB. I cried the moment he left until the moment I heard him open the door. I never told anyone. \n\n\nSpring break was coming up and my school had planned a Europe trip for us. My best friend and I were both expecting our periods on this trip. We kept making funny jokes about it. Though when mine didn\u2019t come I didn\u2019t panic because my periods were often late. I blamed it on the traveling  and my bodies \u201cjet lagged\u201d. \n\n\nI took my pregnancy on April 1st. When it came back positive I was laughing. I was like nice joke lol it\u2019s April fools. God be playing me.  I showed my boss and he was so happy. \u201cWe are pregnant he said\u201d.  I knew I needed to get an abortion.  A few days later I told my friends I might be pregnant, so we skipped jazz and all 3 of us headed to the teen clinic near our school. I peed in a cup that my friends saw. They were there when the nurse told me I was pregnant. I was in disbelief! There she explained my options and told me about the abortion process. While with my friends who were scared shitless I was like well guys I know I don\u2019t want it so why should I stress? Why should I be so scared?? I was 17 I was not ready to raise a kid. I don\u2019t want this. I kept thinking what I was going to tell my parents who already disproved of this man. When I told my boss I didn\u2019t want to keep it he threatened my job, my reputation, he threatened to somehow tell my whole school. I was so scared.\n\nI finally grew some balls and left my boss. He treated me so badly and he left me with so much PTSD. I called the abortion clinic for an \u201cappointment\u201d and two weeks later my friend drove me downtown to the very secret building. I was so scared, I was a kid. \n\nI got permission from my principle (who was also my neighbour) to take a leave of school without my parents getting a phone call home. I didn\u2019t want them knowing i missed school cause then they would\u2019ve known something was up. \n \nEntering the building I walked up to the front Desk to see a waiting room full of other nervous girls. There I filled out some papers about my health and age. I handed it back to her and the lady was shocked that I was 17. I waited 5 hours in that waiting room with my friend until I got taken to another room away from my friend. \n\nThis nurse gave me an ultrasound, showing me everything. She told me I was 8 weeks pregnant. At the end I asked her to print me off a photo of it to show my friend after the procedure. Then I waited for another hour until a therapist pulled into a room. She explained to me my options and asked me if I wanted the medical procedure or the at home procedure, and then if I wanted birth control after this. I asked for the medical procedure and the IUD as well. Then I waited some more in the waiting room. After waiting for 30 mins this nurse came and gave me my IV, and a skirt to change into. The last wait of the day was for 2 hours. This day was so nerve racking for me. I didn\u2019t Cry once but I was so scared. I knew that once this was over my problems would go away. I showed zero emotion through this. I laughed with my friends about this. I thought I was strong. I was the last patient called into the room. Here the doctor who would perform the procedure greeted me as Well as a nurse who would manage the pain medication. The doctor told me to lift my legs onto these raised foot holder things. I was completely exposed. This is where I stared to panic a bit. Then the doctor told me that this will hurt a bit and opened my cervix. I screamed louder then I ever screamed before. The pain was horrible. The nurse doing my pain medication gave me  more because I screamed and then everything hit me.\n\nEvery single emotion hit me. I cried and cried. I weeped in pain, mental and physical. I was raped by a man who I thought I loved and was also my boss. I had no one to turn to. I was getting rid of something that I never wanted. I Kept thinking this isn\u2019t me this isn\u2019t my life I am a band nerd I am a loser who spends her lunches on the piano. What happened to me?! \n \nThe nurses tried to calm me down by telling me I was doing a great job but I tuned them all out. It felt good to cry and scream for once. When it was over the doctor kept yelling at me in joy that I wasn\u2019t pregnant I wasn\u2019t pregnant I\u2019m not pregnant anymore. She closed my cervix and I could finally catch a breath. Then I heard her whisper to the nurse. She forgot to put in my IUD So then she had to reopen my cervix to place the copper into my body. She asked me if I wanted to see the remains of fetus. I said sure and she showed me in the bucket. When it was over the doctor physically carried me out onto a recovery pad. They\u2019re I just whimpered and cried. I was high off of the drugs but I could still hear and function. My doctor told the recovery nurse that it went very rough, and I was only 17. She gave me a warm towel and a thing of crackers and juice. She directed me to the bathroom and helped me out on a pair of special underwear. \nMy best friend then picked me up with her boyfriend and drove me home. I cried myself to sleep that night. \n\nThe next day I went to work and I worked 8 whole hours. I was on my feet moving around in constant cramping pain. I just wanted to end my life. I saw my boss there and he just bullied me with a group of his friends. \n\nAfter that day I wasn\u2019t the same. I was so depressed. I didn\u2019t know how depression felt until I had it.  The girl who would always be 5 mins early to her classes didn\u2019t show up to school. I stopped caring in friendships and I just laid in my bed and cried. \n \n\nMy birthday was 6 days after my abortion. I cried myself to sleep that night. My 18th birthday my first few minutes of being An adult and I was crying. Perfect. Mother\u2019s Day was also a few weeks after that.  I wasn\u2019t a mother, but I feel like the worst human in the world. \n\nAlso this is when the abortion laws in the USA were going wack and everyone was posting about it on there instagrams saying that they were pro-choice. This is a good thing. I am not dissing this at all I\u2019m happy that people did that and supported pro-choice. What I didn\u2019t enjoy was being constantly reminded that I just had my abortion and it was very traumatic. What I didn\u2019t enjoy was scrolling through my Instagram feed and seeing a dead fetus with the caption this shouldn\u2019t scare you. I cried so much. \n\nAt first I thought I was so depressed because I had ptsd From my rough procedure experience. But i soon realized that I also lost something that was mine. And I know that I made the right choice but I couldn\u2019t grasp the fact that it was gone. I was raped. I never wanted the kid. It was a mistake that I didn\u2019t even have a choice in making. And I was shamed by him for making the choice to terminate.  I was so so sad. \nFriends tried to reach out and help me out but i couldn\u2019t explain the emotions I was going through. I felt so lonely. I dropped out of jazz cause I wasn\u2019t going to the early morning classes. I felt like a waste of space. Also let me tell you the 1st period you get after the abortion HURTS. \n\nI pulled my ass together and graduated. I was proud of myself. I smiled as I took the photo with my principle holding my diploma. He kept my secret safe and I love him for that. School was over. My senior year was over and I wasted it on crying in my room and being SEVERELY depressed. I hated myself for that.  I finally told my parents about my abortion after they caught me staring at my walls in my room. \n\nAfter these months pasted the sadness slowly left. I am still very sad. And when November hit I cried because that was when I would\u2019ve had my baby. I didn\u2019t cry cause I wanted the kid. I cried because I felt so defeated. \n\nThis story does have some good news though! It gets better!\n\nI recently got accepted into university for Linguistics! I want to become an ASL teacher! I also met an amazing guy. He\u2019s my current boyfriend and we\u2019ve been together for almost 6 months. He\u2019s truly the nicest person ever. And I love him so much. It gets better ladies!!\n\n(I left my stupid job too) and I completely cut ties to my boss. I reported him and got a severance pay for his pain he caused me!!\n\nSo reflecting on this whole journey I am still so sad. I am still so depressed. I think very often about how my life would be if I kept the baby. Though I know I made the right choice it still makes me sad because I shouldn\u2019t have even had to make that choice. Something I also realized that the reason why I wanted to abort my pregnancy was so I could have a reason to leave my boyfriend boss. I\u2019m happy I did. \n\nThank you for listening to my story, you guys this is very hard for me to express. I still get ptsd from sex and my periods  sometimes.  This is all true I didn\u2019t make any of this up and sorry if I made any spelling mistakes/ horrible grammar I made this at 4am-6am. It\u2019s hard for me to bring up all of these memories but I\u2019m glad I did. Thank you.",

Just google it, but I think its 5 birth control pills that equal the dose? Something like that. So if you ever have an \u2018oops\u2019 again and can\u2019t get to the pharmacy to take plan b, your pills can work. (If you aren\u2019t familiar with the morning after pill/plan b, look into that! Its a priceless option to have for situations like what just happened- you can take it *after* and it keeps you from getting pregnant!)",

I am able to get an appointment May 19 for this. I was supposed to go away for that long weekend. I am worried about how bad the side effects will be, especially if I am away from home. If I am not away from home, I would be home alone all weekend, which is a different scary.\n\nMy other option is an Aspiration Abortion. I can get that both sooner (appointment options) and later as there is more time they can do it in. But my roommate works most evenings/nights, so I would have to find someone to get me home and I would be alone again for the night up until about 2am.  \n\nI also have PCOS and am scared that I could have a miscarriage before these appointments even come up. Are there any specific features of either option that sold you personally? Any advice for deciding?",

You do not deserve to be held prisoner by the evil actions of a man upon you.\n\nWhat happened to you is absolutely disgusting. Needless to say that the man who raped you is a sick individual and I hope karma kicked him in the ass for what he did to you if the legal system hasn't. This understandably has been an extremely traumatic and hard for you. The doctor who showed you the foetus is also a manipulative little fuck. You were already suffering from trauma and in a very vulnerable position. These doctors know this and took advantage to push their own personal agenda. \n\nI know upon all this trauma I understand it can be disturbing to see the physical formation of a developing human inside you. If you say you were 3 months gone (So you were around 12 weeks?) At this time the foetus hs just surpassed embryonic stage and has begun to form more distinct humanesque features but rest assured it still has no sentience and is still a far cry from having any minute conceptualization of their existence. They have no developed nervous system and cannot feel pain. No disrespect but at this stage of development they have no more sentience than an oyster does (no CNS, no functioning brain) \n\nYou are understandably very upset and still tormented by these awful things that happened to you and I'm not here to tell you how to feel but the suffering you are going through way surpasses that of the suffering (or lack-there-of) the foetus experienced when you terminated. \n\nYou are important and while it has clearly had a negative mental impact on you I hope one day you stop blaming yourself for something that for the foetus has always been and always will always be a non-issue.

It took 2 days they had to use sea weed sticks to naturally dilate me for the procedure due to the fact the fetus was abnormally large and j had a very small pelvis. It was a nightmare. The Dr held up the fetus for me to see after he removed it.. They eventually shut down for a lot of illegal and psychotic things they were doing. Anyways.. I now have a total of 6 kids all grown and even grandkids. To this day I still wake up crying having nightmares about that abortion. I wish I didn't do it. I should have had the baby and put it up for adoption. It wasn't the baby's fault it was conceived. It makes me feel so guilty.. I literally feel like a baby murderer. ",

About 50% of people having abortions have had at least one abortion before, and it's estimated the number might be even higher because people don't self-report bc of the stigma.

In conclusion, we do not know when human life begins but we do know that when brain waves are detected in fetuses at 8 weeks old that they are capable and have the potential of having consciousness. Isn't this reason enough to at least lessen the pregnancy time period of legality of abortions?\n\nWe actually know a great deal about the cognitive development of babies. For example, a baby less than one year old has yet to develop what is called a theory of mind. It does not distinguish between itself and the world around if. We know that around one year old, at the earliest, is when it starts to develop a sense of self and self awareness. And that is also the same time that it starts to develop object permanence.\n\nBrain waves tell us very little about what is going on inside the noggin in many cases. Like you said - a person in a coma, someone we might take off life support, may have some kind of brain activity.\n\nHowever, if the standard is personhood in the context of cognitive development, which is what you are proposing, then it would be form of [special pleading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading) to limit this strictly to human beings. Many animals have significantly greater cognitive development than a fetus, or even a baby. A pig, a dog, a dolphin. Animals that we brutalize and eat. So from a cognitive point of view the bar is set very high. A fetus does not come anywhere near meeting it - not even a newborn baby does.",

Please excuse any diminutive explanations, as it seems I have a lot to explain and very limited capacity to do so.\n\nI would like to address a reoccurring theme. Humanity is not in question, never has been and I have yet to bring up a topic that talks about humanity as anything separate from animals. I beg you; please stop trying to think that I am trying to define what constitutes humanity. Nearly every reply has accused me of determining a \u2018basis for human rights,\u2019 I am not, I will not and your attempts to assume that I do are making it seem like you have no interest in evolving. What I AM doing is describing what has rights (sentient life) and what does not (non-sentient life), nothing here has any bearing on determining humanity. \n\nAlso, if you can please try to answer some of my questions as am interested in what you say as well and even though I lack brevity at times, I am not only concerned with my thoughts and understandings. I assume you must have some capability for examining rationality and science to move beyond your view since you took up this discussion with me. Also, I am perfectly open to flaws in my science or logic, please point them out to me preferably with documentation. \n\nFirst of all, [Humans are animals]( http://batpigandme.com/wp-content/uploads/humans-vs-animals.jpg). This is a biological fact taught in grade school. To say animals are irrelevant to this discussion is to say that humanity is irrelevant to this discussion. I am trying to allow you to open your mind to the fact that there is nothing special or unique about being human. We are just another form of life that we classify under the kingdom Animalia.\n\n> sentience is an arguable definition\n\nThis is factually incorrect, there is a clear definition and a basic biological understanding of sentience. Sentience, being the capacity to experience is part of the continuity of evolution so it follows that there is no basic difference in Sentience between humans and other animals. Please read [Susan Blackmore's book for more information]( http://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-An-Introduction-Susan-Blackmore/dp/0199739099 ). No bacteria, virus, fungi or plant life exhibits this quality of sentience. \n\nSentience must be described in scientific terms, which I have done. I implore you to re-read see my explanation of the thalamo-cortical complex and perhaps the work of [Anil Seth]( http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Models_of_consciousness ) and his colleagues for more on the science. The only difference between animals and other life is sentience. An example, a chimpanzee is sentient, a mushroom is not. \n\n> What does sentience have to do with anything?\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the logic.\n\nLife is something that has the ability to [grow, metabolize, respond (to stimuli), adapt, and reproduce.](http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Life) This means a tree, virus, fungi, deer, chimps and humans are forms of life on this planet. \n\nLife, on its own does not warrant a right to life. We can clearly see this by the following logic:\n\n* Viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants etc\u2026are not sentient.\n* Viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants etc. do not have a right to life. \n* Non-sentient life does not have a right to life. \n\n    From this logic, we can conclude that life absent of sentience do not a right to life and that the virtue of life itself does not warrant rights.\n\n* Animals are sentient.\n* Animals do have a right to life. \n* Sentient life has a right to life. \n\n    From this logic, we can conclude that sentient life does have a right to life.\n\nAs the discussion is about human abortion, we will use a human fetus as the example. A fetus prior to the 24th \u2013 28th week in the human gestation cycle (from this point forward this is what I will be referring to as a fetus) does not have the anatomical structure to provide sentience. So we can apply the above logic:\n\n* Fetuses are not sentient, like other non-sentient life lacks the anatomical structures needed.\n* Non-sentient life does not have a right to life. \n* Fetuses do not have a right to life. \n\nAs you can see sentience has everything to do with the discussion at hand. It's the key to and the basis upon which to determine what has the right to life. Until life is capable of sentience it has no rights, and as such there can be no argument of discrimination and no petition for infringement of rights.\n\n> \u2026 clump of cells is human will always be human from the moment of conception\n\nDid you know that you as a human have over 10 trillion cells? How many live cells have you lost through no fault of your own, whether it\u2019s from bleeding, shedding skin, neuron degradation\u2026 Every day clumps of your cells are dying. Like a Fetus, these cells have no sentience on their own thus have no right to life. Can you imagine the legal issues if non-sentient cells had a right to life? Multiple murder cases would be brought up on a regular basis on everyone!\n\nI hope by now I have given a clear understanding of why sentience is such a big deal. It is literally the linchpin for all rights, without sentience there would be no rights. This is why it plays such a big role in determining abortion legislation. Our legislative and judicial system relies on empirical-rational to guide it\u2019s decision in regards to abortions. \n\n> I don't think you have any idea what you're talking about\n\nI feel bad that you cannot understand me. My uncle once told me that an intelligent person is someone that can converse with all levels of intellect and be equally understood by all. I guess I have a lot of work to do on that front. \n\nThis was my best effort to explain all of this to you. I hope it has not gone in vain and you will at the very least read up on some of this. All life is precious; no one is saying that it is not. I appreciate every plant in my garden, every apple I eat, every animal I encounter and every life that is conceived. I want there to be no abortions, which is why I fight for sex education and for birth control freely available for everyone. I don\u2019t want anyone to get an abortion, but it is not for me to say what someone does with their body. I don\u2019t want people to self harm, commit suicide or for people with beautiful hair to shave it all off, a friend recently did this and I went nuts for a good five seconds! We cannot restrict what someone does with their body. Since a fetus has no rights, it is up to the woman caring for it, providing it sustenance and essentially giving it life to decide what to do with. Just like all other cells in her body it\u2019s her right to do with as she pleases until it joins the rest of us sentient beings and with its new found consciousness the right to live.\n\nEdits: clarity and formatting.",

Without sentience describe how morality and rights develop? It takes an entity capable of self awareness to develop a set of moral codes of which we have colloquially called rights. Without sentience we have no rights, it's really a simple concept. \n\nI know biology and anatomy, apparently better than you. I would certainly learn a bit more and the role sentience plays in development both anatomically, biologically and anthropologically. \n\nI have yet to hear a counter to any argument other than your unexplainable concern for human rights that have little to do with the fetus, since until a fetus is sentient it does not have rights. \n\nA clump of embryonic cells is not an animal anymore than a clump of single cells make an multicellular organism, however both scenarios can develop over time into what follows. \n\nAn animal, like a human, has rights. A collection of cells belong to the being nurturing them like your gut bacteria, and have no rights. \n\nExplain how a non sentient item, being incapable of self awareness or consciousness like an apple, can be disenfranchised of its rights?

For the purpose of this conversation remove the distinction humanity has for you among other life on the planet. \n\nI do not, have not, will not ever separate humanity from everything else. I am talking ALL SENTIENT LIFE. \n\nThere is a clear definition with a biological component in terms of the fetus which I addressed. As a definition, Sentience is the ability to feel, perceive, or be conscious, or to have subjective experiences. \n\n>Scientific American - Consciousness requires a sophisticated network of highly interconnected components, nerve cells. Its physical substrate, the thalamo-cortical complex that provides consciousness with its highly elaborate content, begins to be in place between the 24th and 28th week of gestation. Roughly two months later synchrony of the electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythm across both cortical hemispheres signals the onset of global neuronal integration. Thus, many of the circuit elements necessary for consciousness are in place by the third trimester\n\nYou are right my argument depends on the level of development, but knowing how the fetus develops is important to the discussion. If a fetus is at the point when its development is not complex enough to be sentient, then like other non sentient biological matter its got no rights. It's a very simple \nconcept, if a fetus does not have the anatomical structures developed to be sentient then it has yet to reach the point where it has right, and thus any rights that can be discussed are only the mothers rights. \n\nAt one point we were all non sentient matter, to take from Carl Sagan we are all star stuff. It only emphasizes that development into sentience is possible for anything, and in terms of abortion if something like the star stuff is non sentient then it has no rights, but once star stuff develops sentience, it has a right to life. By tying to focus on what is human you are ignoring development into sentience. By your argument killing fungi, bacteria or a virus should be just as nonlegal as abortion in the first two trimesters. \n\n\nYour are trying to think of this as human vs subhuman which I am not even talking about. We are talking about one right, the right to life. Every sentient being, human, dolphin, pig or chimp has a right to life, but prior to their development into sentience they have the same rights as a mushroom has to live. \n\nAgain I am not separating humans from anything else. I am separating sentient beings from non sentient beings and saying those that are sentient do have right to life and that do not do not have that right. Human rights only exist because we can communicate with each other. Recently our knowledge and intellect has grown as a community to give us awareness of sentience in other animals, giving us animal rights. Killing other sentient being without reason, such as sustenance as we like everything else need to eat, is murder. You would face animal abuse charges for taking a chainsaw to your dog. \n\nYes there is a universal right to life for every sentient being. \n\n>Unique human chromosomal set of DNA is the only sufficient... separates viruses, animals, trees, pigs... from us \n\nTrue, our DNA makes viruses and pigs and humans and trees different. That's all that DNA does. It does not grant rights, you do not have a set of unique rights simply based on your DNA and if you are suggesting we do that, discrimination is a major concern, have you seen the movie Gattaca? \n\n> and is why we have a basic right to life and a tree and pig don't \n\nFalse, a virus is not sentient, does not have a right to life, animals that are sentient do, such as a pig. A tree, to our knowledge, is not sentient therefore like the virus has not right to life. \n\nHow would abortion be a civil rights issue for a fetus that does not have any rights? The only civil rights issue is oppression of a woman's right to do with her cells as she wished, since she grew the cells... She can decide what to do with them until the cells develop sentience. At that point the new being has a right to life.",

Because of this, historically, minorities have been disenfranchised because of such ideas sentience or this ability or that being used to determine who's humans and has rights and who is subhuman and does not.  I have a bachelors in history and have some familiarity with this idea.\n\nSo, sentience isn't going to cut it, flat and simple, its not the basis for what separates humans from everything else.

A cluster of cells that have yet to form sentience whether it be a cluster of chimp, equestrian , bovine, rat or human have not, but once any of those cell clusters form that capability it then has rights and at that point striping of its life is cruel and infringes on the beings right to life, but prior to that point it has no right to life, it's as inconsequential as a leaf. \n\nThe needless killing of sentient life is where I draw the line and call it murder. If a mother pig kills a pig for no reason it is murder, if a female pig aborts pig fetus before it is sentient it is not murder since the life is no more capable than the life of a tree. \n\nIsn't the only difference between a virus and you and me just our level of development along the evolutionary line??

There are so many families in poverty, why force another child into either of these situations.  \n\nThat being said, abortion in the 3rd trimester should be considered illegal, this is late term abortion and at that point is cruel. If you haven't figured out that you are pregnant and do not want to carry to term within 6 months, then you are just being cruel to a sentient life, since at about 6 months a fetus becomes self aware. Prior to about 6 months, the fetus is not possibly sentient, Its physical substrate, the thalamo-cortical complex that provides consciousness, begins to be in place between the 24th and 28th week of gestation. This procedure is required for a fetus to begin its consciousness. I think that the needless killing of being that capable of self awareness is cruel.\n\n",

        "body": "It is important to separate your own beliefs on abortion aside from what is just in your eyes. Several pro-choicers despise abortions and would not get them themselves. Yet, they based their views on society as a whole and each individuals moral views.\n\nHowever, when another \"life\" comes into the picture it may no longer be only about the mother. This is the typical question that pro-lifers and pro-choicers must ask themselves. At which point does human life, human person, begin? \n\nAfter reading about late-term fetuses that have been aborted and still live as premature infants and developing into full adults, I would like to believe that everyone agrees on not aborting a late-term fetus. \n\nNow, do I believe that life begins at conception? Yes, that is the pure definition of life in my opinion. \nThe scientific definition of life usually goes like this(although not accepted by all): \n\n1. Living things are highly organized.\n\n2. All living things have an ability to acquire materials and energy.\n\n3. All living things have an ability to respond to their environment.\n\n4. All living things have an ability to reproduce.\n\n5. All living things have an ability to adapt.  \n\n\nThis definition fits perfectly to bacteria. But we kill bacteria and other living things and this is morally and socially very acceptable. \n\nSo does that mean that that life is a person? This is the question that is highly debated. When does life begin? at the first heart beat? At the first detectable brain waive? At the point which the fetus begins to resemble an infant? Science is not certain.\n\nSome say, at the moment of consciousness? So is a person in a coma human anymore? He still has brain waves for certain. Yet, beyond the point of hope that he will ever regain consciousness he is killed by doctors after they ask the family if it is okay to cut the cord or cough up more money. This is socially acceptable. Why is that? I believe it is because he is beyond the point of hope for regaining consciousness. Although I still believe he is human, it is decided that he does not have potential any longer.\n \nWhat even makes a human so special from all the other animals our there? Why are we different from apes or any other similar animals in evolutionary standards. Is it because we have emotions? Is it because we are more intelligent? You could claim a dog has an emotion but he is not human. An infant is not intelligent so should we dispose of it too? Of course not. An infants brain is still developing, teen brains are still developing which means that they have the potential to be fully developed adult human beings that can have consciousness and emotion and potential to make a difference in the world through education or empathy, etc. Several things make us human including our potential. \n\nSo is human potential the definition of human life? Would sperm and eggs cells match this view? No, this is an implication of ourselves it is not until the fertilization that DNA becomes intermingled with each other creating a unique child. What of twins? Before the splitting of the cells were they one fetus or two? There are several questions that arise when debating this and some cannot be answered with the science today but that does not make them any less likely to be true.\n\nIn every way, fetuses would match the view of reasonable human potential being human life. \n\nHaving consciousness means that this gives a human an awareness of himself. In conclusion, we do not know when human life begins but we do know that when brain waves are detected in fetuses at 8 weeks old that they are capable and have the potential of having consciousness.  Isn't this reason enough to at least lessen the pregnancy time period of legality of abortions?\n\nIt is like being innocent until proven guilty, to be alive until proven dead. I think we deserve the potential life-changing mistake to have reasonable doubt.",

I can tell you that for me it was just a few hours of breathing through cramping and pretty intense bleeding. I hope you can surround yourself with comfort- I sat on my living room floor with hot tea, a tv show on that I knew would make me laugh, and a trash next to me for nausea. That part I didn\u2019t expect. I can tell you that as soon as it passed I felt IMMEDIATE relief of all pregnancy symptoms I was experiencing. It was a trip. I woke up the next day feeling like myself and proud of the decision that I made. You will get through this and you will be better and stronger because of what you are going through.

Hopefully also accessible.\n\n> I know that in places where it\u2019s illegal it makes sense to go that route but in general if there is access to legal abortion I would suggest to do that by all means! \n\nSo would I.  There's this thing in medicine called the \"risk reduction model\" -- think providing needles and safe injection sites for IV drug addicts.  I don't want people inducing their own abortions, but I want them to have access to accurate information about it, and to have access to the safest self-induced abortion they can if they do decide to do that.  My mind was changed on this recently, when I became a fan of plancpills.org.\n\n> it just seems very dangerous to make self abortion seem safe.\n\n\"Self-abortion\" is a broad category, as you demonstrate.  The truth is that *legal* abortion has made *illegal* abortion much safer.  There isn't a big difference between me giving somebody mife+miso in the office, and them getting it online and taking it at home.\n\nMind you, there are some small differences that make it *less* safe: are we sure of their gestational age?  Will they be able to follow instructions on seeking care if they have a complication?  Will they get good contraceptive counseling along with their abortion?  These are all risks that are reduced by having more information.\n\n> I really don\u2019t mean to come off as disrespectful\n\nI figured!  And I figured that you wouldn't know if you didn't look through my post history that I've got a decently-informed opinion on this.  I'm an OB/gyn and I perform abortions as a large part of my practice.  That doesn't make me automatically right about everything, and I try not to be heavy-handed about it.",

I do live in a country actually where it is very easy to get an abortion but I am from a society that is a minority in this country that is very conservative. Luckily there is a policy here that you can keep it completely confidential them off of your medical records.

You may be perfectly fine and be good to go about your life the next day, or you'll feel like your period hit you with the full force of a semi truck. My point is that youve gotta be patient and take this how it comes and face new problems as they arise. There is no one way to deal with an abortion or the medical side effects. This thread is very scary because we talk about some scary things and when you've never been through this before I know how terrifying it can be. But only looking at the negative side of things isn't going to help your mental health or do anything to make this easier on you. The whole point of this thread is helping eachother. I don't know if you've noticed but anyone who hasn't been through this themselves is pretty ignorant to it so we are here to help eachother out because that's all we've got Is eachother.

I don't know if that's standard but the confirming doctor, the nurse, and the gyno all said it was necessary to ensure my safety. I tried to get out of it in the ER because I was scared. I read absolute horror stories. PP told me to expect severe nausea, diarrhea, headaches, severe cramping, heavy bleeding, blood clots the size of lemons... the forum mostly told me I'd probably be upset and have cramping, nausea, etc.. \n\n\nMy doctor prescribed medication I wasn't expecting and found confusing. But it worked like it was supposed to and my abortion was fairly simple and pleasant given the circumstances. Every single persons body is different. Can physicians mess up? Absolutely. Should you get a second opinion? If you feel you need it, absolutely. You have a right to thorough care. I don't necessarily agree with your original statement in regard to the forum because it isn't for medical advice.",

The moderator said that's not normal and a doctor shouldn't do that. It made me nervous and I had to call another gynocologist I know who confirmed to me that he is right and this is what comforted me in the end. \n\n2) After having the medical procedure and explaining the way the doctor prescribed the pills (while in the midst of starting to bleed): again, one of the moderators told me that I shouldn't trust the doctor and that it seems he prescribed them in the wrong way (this is a very famous doctor who does several abortions everyday in a private prestigious clinic). It also made me paranoid and then my boyfriend told me to never go back on this forum again.",

Because this is a support community however, the women who DO post here tend to be in the minority of women that are struggling emotionally or experiencing complications, which is totally fine because this is a place where women can seek help! \n\nIf one was to look at the experiences on this sub, they would think abortion is terrifying and leads to tremendous regret/ guilt/ sadness, even though that isn't the case for the majority of women. I have also seen a couple forced-birthers posting here, so some of it could be trolls trying to scare women off of abortion or giving false information, though the mods do a good job keeping trolls away. \n\nWhile this space is very helpful and necessary, it's always best to seek doctor's advice or online information from trusted organizations as well.",

It was one of the most nerve wrecking and stressful weeks in my life, although I live in a country where it's very very very easy to get one. During this week, this forum was my source of comfort. However, the stories I read and the advice I saw caused me so much confusion, paranoia and anxiety and my friends screamed at me a few times to stop reading things on this forum and my boyfriend, who is a programmer also told me to STOP. According to what I read, i was going to go home and either throw up, faint in the shower, or be unable to walk. I got home after the doctor inserting the pills into me and I started to bleed with minor cramps until the morning and now I have light bleeding and taking the other pills he gave me. It was completely fine. After so, I still continued with reddit and I posted my experience and I got a message from the moderator telling me that the doctor might be using a wrong method and to look at sources to check what the right way. I told my boyfriend that I got this message in my thread and he told me that if I go on reddit again, he would be very mad at me and to stop reading things that are NOT WHAT THE DOCTOR INSTRUCTED ME TO DO. \n\nI REALLY DO THINK THIS FORUM IS VERY IMPORTANT AND CAN BE A GREAT SUPPORT NETWORK- ESPECIALLY FOR GIRLS AND WOMEN WHO LIVE WHERE ABORTION IS ILLEGAL BUT, I HAVE A RECOMMENDATION: As long as you are not a professional doctor, I  think this forum can be very confusing for a lot of women and it leads them to make decisions or have thoughts that are unnecessary. I think it's important to create guidelines in this forum that mainly emphasize the fact that if a moderator or if anyone is giving medical advice on how to use medicine, then it should be stated that they are a licensed medical professional and if it is not a licensed medical professional then to make it clear that the stories that are being shared are simply from very personal individual experiences.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is my opinion. I felt like I really wanted to share this after going through the last week because this forum has really affected me.",

However, I have come to be more opened about my reproductive story and been able to come to terms with it. I think this is also kind of a catharsis.\n\nI have been going through these experiences since 12 years ago, with different partners, at different life circumstances. None are comparable to the others, and it has not necessarily anything to do with how much I wanted the pregnancy, or how much I loved my partner then.\n\nOne aspect that was transversal to all my experiences is that I never felt able to communicate properly with my partner at the time. They were all effected in their own individual way, but we weren\u2019t able to communicate efficiently at any time. I always had the feeling I was more severely effected than they were.\n\nWith time, with therapy and after retrospectively reviewing all these situations, I have come to the conclusion my own pain and needs prevented me from perceiving how truly my partners were effected. Even when they didn\u2019t want the pregnancy to evolve.\n\nFirst of all, men are effected by pregnancy. Women are physically effected since the beginning and the physical and emotional bonding to the developing embryo or fetus is certainly deeper, for biological reasons. But that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t have an impact on men since the beginning. To start with, it\u2019s an event that is perceived by men as truly life-changing, whether it is planned/wanted or not. When it is not planned, men usually need to take some time to overcome the initial shock, acknowledging the new reality and their own feelings and desires towards it. Even at this stage, the focus is placed so much more on what women want and feel, than on men\u2019s perspective. This reality may be more abstract to men because their body is not involved, but still their life is going to change dramatically (specially when the pregnancy was not planned). It\u2019s so common to hear men saying they wish they had room to discuss all the possible options, including terminating, and not doing so because they believe it\u2019s not something to even bring up if the woman is excited about being a mother. And still, though they contributed to the pregnancy as well, their life is also going to change and they feel they should be resigned to support the woman without a previous conversation focusing both side\u2019s expectations, feelings and desires. Some men even feel like they have no part to take on the decision, while others may seem a bit insensitive telling their partners they don\u2019t feel ready to become a parent - but the truth is, while they have no right to put pressure on anyone to make a certain decision, they have the right to their own feelings and to the chance of expressing their desires and expectations. It\u2019s also their life that is going to change.\n\nSometimes the pregnancy is lost before the couple is able to discuss their options, in the case it wasn\u2019t planned. Even when it is planned, sometimes the couple wasn\u2019t expecting it to happen at a specific time, specially if they were trying for long, or if they have just started trying and it happened only after few trials. Or even when it happens at the perfect timing for both, the pregnancy may be lost before both have time to process their emotions and reorganize their lives. In all cases, pregnancy loss comes with a feeling of loss of control. As if planning just doesn\u2019t mean anything in real life. No matter if we want it or not, even if we try to prevent it, it may always happen; or if we try to provoke it, it doesn\u2019t necessarily happen when we want, or everytime we try. I would say a pregnancy loss always comes with a deep feeling of loss of control, as a shock. Shock for the sudden change of the events, shock for the realization of how little and impotent we are. This is equally true both for men and women.\n\nAs to the reaction to the loss itself, it\u2019s understandable that women\u2019s emotional pain is more deep and visceral, because men don\u2019t go through the physical pain. But though they don\u2019t experience the loss directly through their body, they also go through the painful emotional and psychological experience of dealing with the medical facilities, the medical staff, the appointments, and may be even consulted to make decisions about the procedures to be done. And worse than that, they literally watch their partner going through all the physical and emotional pain, with a feeling of impotence, and not knowing what to do, or what is best, or correct. This is in no way an experience from an observer\u2019s perspective. This is to be directly involved in the situation. Only in a different manner. This is why I believe a pregnancy loss is something that happens to men as much as it happens to women. The sense of loss may be different among the two of them, but the loss itself effects both. It\u2019s just perceived in different ways.\n\nAs to the sense of loss itself, women are obviously more likely to have to deal with a deeper, more intense and lasting sense of loss. Most of times, the embryo or fetus itself was already a real baby to the woman. If the loss happened very early on, an ultrasound has not been made yet, the notion of a developing embryo or fetus may be more abstract to men. But still, it may be really difficult to a man to deal with the loss of something that was not even \u201cquite real\u201d to him. A woman knows precisely what she is mourning. She experiences what it is like for her body to get rid of something she was generating. By this time, specially if the loss happened at an early stage, the man might be dealing with preparing himself for the new reality of potentially becoming a parent, losing the chance to make a choice and/or being unprepared for the turn of the events, and then having to process the loss of something that he didn\u2019t know yet what meant to him. When the pregnancy is unwanted, it is not uncommon to men to take a while to accept and adapt to the new reality, trying to make sense of what becoming a parent with that person, in those specific circumstances mean. And then there\u2019s a sudden turn of the events, and the pregnancy doesn\u2019t exist anymore. How do men feel about acknowledging they contributed to a pregnancy, whether consciously or not, and then it\u2019s not there anymore, without their contribution, opinion or decision? It might bring some relief if the pregnancy was unwanted, if one or both wanted to have an abortion but were not sure about it and were afraid of making a wrong decision, or if the timing was not perfect. But even if the loss turns out to be a relief for man, it doesn\u2019t mean he will be content or glad. He may even wish the partner never got pregnant at all, but he will never be able to handle a loss lightly. Simply because it is not a light, brief situation, and because he is directly involved in it, as we saw before.\n\nEven if the loss turns out to be the man\u2019s \u201cpreference\u201d (as in he doesn\u2019t need to deal with the possibility of becoming a parent anymore), it is absolutely not the way he wanted it to happen. He may wish he could \u201cundone\u201d the pregnancy, but certainly not through the morbidity of a pregnancy loss, involving blood, medical procedures, watching his partner devastated and the anxiety concerning her wellbeing. Will she fully recover from this? Will she be able to resume her life soon? Will he need to take care of her? Will they have to let other family members know, or ask them for help? What is the real dimension of an event like this, for a couple and a family? If the pregnancy was already known by other family members, how will they tell the horrible news?\n\nAnd finally, something that doesn\u2019t always occur to us, women: we mourn the loss of a potential baby, a potential future. Men mourn the loss of a partner as she was before the loss. Most of us take a lot of time to process, to physically recover and emotionally heal. During all that time, it\u2019s not as if nothing had happened to men. On the contrary, it is still happening and it is quite real. It\u2019s not \u201cproblem solved, I can\u2019t do anything else to help, let\u2019s just resume to where we were before\u201d. A woman rarely returns to who she was before a loss. Sometimes she even loses herself. Consequently, the man also loses his partner, his girlfriend, his dear wife. He just wishes he could do anything to bring her back. But he can\u2019t, sometimes it even seems like he tries to help and do everything he can, and it just seems every word or action is worse and damages the situation even more. The man might even look numb, or trying to avoid the subject because it\u2019s too uncomfortable or painful, but this only means he is also being effected and he doesn\u2019t know what it means to him, or what is the best or right thing to do. To make everything worse, usually men are not even asked how they feel (sometimes not even by their partner), and they have to support their partner without any advice or support to himself.  He has to become a nurse and a therapist and still keeping his role as a partner, boyfriend or husband to a woman who sometimes reacts in a way completely new and surprising to him.\n\nWe, women tend to demand our partners to feel the loss as intensely as we do. And some men will truly grieve profoundly, specially if the pregnancy was planned and deeply wanted. But for all the reasons, starting with the physical and biological ones, it\u2019s perfectly normal if the loss is perceived in a different way between both. The man may even be relieved that he\u2019s not going to be a parent anymore, but he\u2019s certainly very concerned and anxious about his partner wellbeing and the future of the relationship after a situation like this. Even if the man looks numb, numbness is already a reaction, a trial to process, and in no way it means indifference. Only a very immature person can go through a pregnancy loss with total indifference.\n\nThe man doesn\u2019t need to be devastated to be truly effected by the loss. Even if he doesn\u2019t mourn the loss of a potential child, even if he doesn\u2019t wish he had been a parent to that potential future baby, even if he doesn\u2019t mourn what could have been, there is no way he can go through this without being effected. The loss will ways be a part of his reproductive story and he is very likely to remember if another similar situation occurs in the future. It\u2019s not just as if something never happened.\n\nI hope this brings peace and some clarity to those who are suffering because they don\u2019t feel like their partner knows what she is feelings. Probably he doesn\u2019t know exactly, but the opposite is also true: we don\u2019t truly know what our partner is feeling, or why he is reacting the way he is. It\u2019s perfectly normal to wish we could communicate in an effective way, but it\u2019s hard to communicate feelings and thoughts we didn\u2019t even process yet. Sometimes we just don\u2019t know how we feel, or why we feel it. And always remember, feelings do not dictate what we want, no matter how intense they are. No feeling is permanent, no feeling means necessarily anything. It\u2019s just what it is.",

I revisited this sub again today, because I'm having a very low period today. Yesterday I had been feeling somewhat \"normal\", or at least what I could describe as numb enough not to be hysterical. Today however, it's like a switch flipped and I'm sobbing constantly again. It's been exactly one week since my abortion, and the bleeding has slowed down. I think the onset of the bleeding also reaffirmed the reality of what had happened, which definitely triggered another depressive episode. I hope the weeks to come get better with time, even if it's ever so slightly, day by day.\n\nHow I'm feeling right now is not sustainable long term. I can tell my poor boyfriend is at a loss as to what to say or do to help me. He keeps asking me what can he do for me, but how can I possibly answer such a question? Nothing anyone can say or do will magically alleviate me mentally, and I'm painfully aware of that. \n\nI feel like I fought such a hard battle coping after the death of my parents and grandpa. My mom was especially hard to get through. So I feel as if I've already given all the fight I had in me, and I've grown tired long before this came to be. I know that's why I'm also struggling now.

I think the stark contrast between your situation then and your situation now is hanging you up. It was so obvious before, but now it's like...well, I *could* potentially do it now, it's not as bad as before....\n\nBut I think that has a bit to do with the rhetoric surrounding abortion and women in general.  The idea that you didn't \"deserve\" an abortion as much as someone else. And that's not fair. Just because you aren't in the worse situation possible does not mean that your reasons are any less valid!\n\nIt is so much harder when you're with someone you love too. Especially if someday you feel like kids are in your future. The truth is though, if everything was perfect you would not have struggled so much. If it was truly the \"right\" time, you wouldn't have made this decision. \n\nHow I would Iook at it personally, is this. It wasn't the right time, and you recognized that. Agonizing over something you cant change wont do either of you any good. The good news is, that at some point, you both want to be parents. Maybe you're a little unsure of exactly when, but you're together in this. When you guys do finally decide to have a child, you will be prepared.  It will be absolutely wanted and have two wonderul parents who are capable and ready to give it all of their love. That child will have a wonderful life and a brighter future....and it will all be because you made this decision now!",

I see a lot of abortion stories that were of wanted pregnancies, but circumstances shifted and they decided it wasn't the best time. It comforts me to know that I'm not alone, because a lot of the time people assume that abortions are a black or white decision and the people that get them are looking forward to having it be over and feel immense relief afterwards. This one is harder than my first, my first abortion I was only 16 and the father was not a good guy. There was zero stability and I was only a junior in high school. Back then I had a million reasons to justify my decision, and while I felt a bit sad I knew without a shadow of a doubt it was the right decision and I wanted the abortion. So this time around, when I love the man who I was pregnant with so very much, I'm struggling mentally. We went this entire time questioning if he was even fertile because of the chemicals that he has worked with for over 25 years, so the fear that we may not be able to conceive again is also weighing on my mind. \n\nAll the other women in the clinic with me were excited to get it over with, and I was jealous of their security in that feeling. I on the other hand was having an internal crisis for the entire 8 hours. I sincerely hope that in time I can come to peace with these feelings, and that in the near future when he and I have squared everything away with our financial goals, we are able to conceive again with a pregnancy that is nothing but joy and excitement, not tainted with feelings of stress and anxiety.

        "body": "   I'm 25 and my boyfriend is 41. We've been together for 6 years and living together for 4. We have a great relationship, stable jobs, great income and a wonderful home. This last year my boyfriend was able to buy things he's always wanted thanks to me switching jobs and making significantly more money. He bought his motorcycle, paid it off, bought a side by side which is paid for, and a brand new 80k diesel truck which is about $1000 per month. \n\n   Unexpectedly we got pregnant for the first time. I found out at 5 weeks. We both felt instant panic and stress, as I work a job involving chemicals that I can't do while pregnant. I'd have to rely on the mercy of my employer to provide me the opportunity to be trained in another position, and hope they didn't give me a massive pay cut. I was knowingly pregnant for about 2 and a half weeks. During that time we agonized over what to do, abort or have a baby. Emotionally I became somewhat attached to the idea of a baby, and began helplessly romanticizing the idea although rationally I felt like it wasn't a good time to have a baby. My boyfriend felt like he would have to get rid of his new truck and work even harder than he usually does to support us if I took a pay cut or lost my job altogether. I felt like I'd feel horrible watching him give up his dream truck and slave away working. We came to the decision to abort, but both felt unsure the entire way through. \n\n    Here's an outline of my reasons why I thought aborting was the best decision\n    *I was working with dangerous chemicals the entire pregnancy. I was worried that occupational exposure could have had adverse health affects to the fetus, especially since the 1st trimester is the most important developmental stage.\n    *I'd have to take a step back from my career path for at least a year. Just this year I finally made it to my desired position and got a huge pay raise. \n     *He would most likely have to sell off his truck, possibly his other toys to make the finances work. \n     *Too much uncertainty about job outlook for me, I'd have to learn a whole new job or take time off and do online schooling to get a license to get a similar paying job in my field.\n     *No time to have our ducks lined up in a row to make sure I would have secure finances all the way through the pregnancy, and even after birth. Even if I took maternity leave, my current job position requires me to be physically present. Would we try to afford daycare, or make me a SAHM and lose my income altogether? \n    *I was unsure if I would be happy losing all my free time and alone time having a newborn around. I like being alone, and enjoy having freedom in doing what I want after a long day at my extremely physical job. \n     *We both have very nice savings accounts, which would be cut at least in half from the expense of medical bills and supplies for the baby, and trying to float ourselves while I worked out a new job prospect. \n\n    With that being said, during my abortion we were separated due to covid reasons. He had to wait outside while i was in the clinic for almost 8 hours. Leading up to it I was texting him and told him I was 7 weeks 4 days. I called him to check up on him after and he sounded like he was crying but didn't say anything to me about it. I found out after the abortion he got emotional after hearing how far along I was and while passing the time was watching people in the street with their kids and he was feeling regretful. I wish he would have told me in the moment. \n\n     The day after, he felt somewhat sad and I felt normal and okay. The day after that and today I feel overwhelming sadness, regret, and depression. I understand I still have pregnancy hormones, which will continue for a few weeks and I may be emotional just from all of the changes happening in my body. But right now, in this moment, I feel such regret. I'm terrified due to his age that it was a miracle we even got pregnant, and I'm worried we won't be able to get pregnant again. I feel like aside from the financial issues, it was meant to be. My parents died in 2019, my grandpa just died the week before I found out I was pregnant. I only have 2 brothers as my family and feel like maybe I needed a baby, to have my own family. I miss the feeling of family. Maybe that would have eased the despair and loss I already felt about loosing people important to me. \n\n   Post abortion we both hopped of the fence, and realized that we do in fact want to have one kid, on our time. To ease the pain from the abortion, we made a time line. Over the next 1-2 years, we would work hard, pay both the trucks off. I can do online courses after work to obtain my license, while keeping my current position and bank a bunch of money. This will allow me to continue a decent paying job, and I can transition to an office position before we even try to conceive to avoid me being exposed to any chemicals, ensuring a safer pregnancy. We could keep our vehicles and toys and financially not stress much at all. I could even get a second license and secure a work from home position if need be so future childcare issues wouldn't matter.\n\n   However I'm overcome by this depression. Now I'm concerned our relationship may not survive if I have a downward spiral mentally, and feel like I can't feel like this for a year or two to be patient and work some things out first. I worry if I told him I wanted to try again sooner than planned, he would either not want to and I would develop resentment towards him, or he would impregnate me again just to end my suffering but secretly not want to and then he would end up resenting me. I'm overcome with anxiety that in another year or two, he will no longer be fertile and we just threw away our only chance. I feel like I should have just kept the pregnancy, it was no one's conscious decision and there would be no feelings of resentment from it being an actual decision from either of us. Doing the math, I realized we probably could have made it work without getting rid of his truck. It would have been harder and more stressful, but I could have just taken a pay cut for month or two and gotten my license while pregnant. \n\n   I feel so sad. And in a dark place. My boyfriend was very supportive of me being sad and feeling regret, until I came clean and told him I'm unsure if I can even wait another year or two feeling like this. When I said that, he seemed stresses and unhappy. I worry for our relationship now, which would have been fine even through an unplanned pregnancy. \n\n   People of reddit, please help me work through some of these feelings.

              "body": "I\u2019m so sorry you had an ectopic pregnancy. They are frightening and life threatening. I will answer your question in 2 ways:\n\n1. Ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilized egg implants in a place it cannot continue to grow until birth. The uterus is a unique and wonderful organ that can grow to accommodate an expanding pregnancy and support the connection between a growing fetus and the pregnant persons body through the attachment of the placenta. When a fertilized egg Implants in another place, most commonly a Fallopian tube, it cannot be accommodated until birth. It will burst a Fallopian tube and can cause internal bleeding. If not treated it can cause death. Is this an abortion? Yes, in the strictest sense it does end or \u201cabort\u201d an ongoing pregnancy if removed.\n\n2. The word \u201calive\u201d when it comes to an embryo is much harder to define as it has several different components that people may frame differently as it\u2019s not black and white. \nAre sperm alive? Well yes, just as other single cell organisms are alive. Are they alive in a spiritual sense? Most of us would say no.\n\nAre fertilized eggs in a Petri dish alive in a spiritual sense? Some say no, some say yes. \nIs a person pregnant when the fertile eggs are outside her uterus? Most of us would say no. \n\nThese are all areas where we have to try to decide how we feel about what we cannot know. Shades of gray.\n\nAre fertilized eggs inside the body but outside the uterus the same as those inside? Well no. The pregnancy cannot continue to birth, it may in fact kill the pregnant person very early in pregnancy if allowed to grow. Is this alive in a spiritual sense? Again, this is a question that there is no clear answer for. \n\nGreat ethicists, physicians and religious leaders have spent their lives grappling with these ideas. Most of us have less time to devote to truly understanding what we cannot know.\n\nThe bottom line to me is this.\n\nStrict definitions of what is correct or \u201c right\u201d do not honor the many feelings that can be associated with pregnancy, birth, and all that surrounds them. We each have to find our own comfort in this and that understanding is our own. You are not another person. Your journey is your own to ask questions, seek to understand, love and care for yourself and those around you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t give you a clear answer. I can tell you I support you to think and feel and understand based on your own heart and mind. We are here to provide you with support when that\u2019s hard and to try to be here to listen.\n\nI hope you know  that you medically intervened in a pregnancy that could not continue in order to go on with your own life\u2019s path. You are worth it.  \u2764\ufe0f",

I went from a 32B to a 32DDD in that pregnancy. I breastfed after delivery so it took a while for my breasts to really empty and return to regular size. My breasts were completely different from prepregnancy, but not only in negative ways. Yes I had some stretch marks and mild sagging (for my small chest size it doesn't really look like sagging, it actually makes my breasts look rounder) but my breasts were Fuller and rounder than before pregnancy and in my opinion they looked better. After my experiences with abortions, the breast Change was minimal. I could feel that they were less full, but it was probably only noticeable to me.\n\nBecause this is your first pregnancy (which in my experience was the one that made my breasts grow the most, the others the change was minor) you may experience a bigger change in size after the procedure, but I doubt you'll have to worry about sagginess or many stretch marks (unless they already started to form) I would guess the only significant change would be seeing your breasts go from this expanded size to your regular size, and possibly some mild 'emptiness' or extra skin feeling. \n\nI understand what you mean by feeling like it would be worth it if you actually went through with having a child and potentially feeding that child from your breasts, but it doesn't feel \"worth it\" or \"fair\" to have your body potentially \"destroyed\" by a fetus you won't carry to term. I've been struggling a lot with that since my most recent abortion. The only physical change I'm really bothered by is my stomach softness, but I've felt bitter over how that part of me feels 'ruined' for a child I didn't even get to have. In my experience it just added to the feeling of 'all this is causing me is pain and distress, I don't have a baby to make it feel right, and this pain (and physical changes) may stay forever for something I never got to hold and love' it's a horrible defeating feeling to have, especially in a situation that already feels like defeat.

My boobs grew a fraction of this size from hormonal birth control a while back and when I went off of it they were noticeably less perky and had some small stretch marks. Now I'm 30 so I'm not exactly a spring chicken, my skin is starting to lose some of its elasticity. I'm worried that this massive boob swelling I'm going through now is gonna totally devastate my rack when they deflate  :/\n\nLike, it's one thing if you're feeding a child, that makes it worth it. But I feel like my body's gonna get destroyed for nothing, just adding to my general feelings of loss and kind of down about myself. I'm moisturizing and even started taking a collagen supplement (I know it probably won't do anything but what the hell). \n\nWhat was your body like after recovery from the pregnancy and abortion? How different was it from before? Any other suggestions besides staying hydrated, nor smoking, and losing weight gradually?\n\nI realize there are bigger concerns at play here, but honestly this is something that's been in my mind as well.\n\nAny other advice for physical aspects of recovery are greatly appreciated. Any particular foods? ",

It is only medical abortion, so they only provide pills. Abortion On Demand only provides for a handful of states though. You video chat with a provider who will go over the process and aftercare. The packaging is incredibly discreet. It\u2019s just a normal fedex packaging. The pills are shipped out 24 hours after your appointment. You do have to pay $239 for it though. That includes nausea pills and a stronger dosage of ibuprofen for cramping, the abortion pills themselves and a pregnancy test you will take a few weeks after your abortion. You will have 24/7 support and access to providers. \n\nMy provider was very kind and made me feel supported. It was a good experience. I know there is a lot of mixed feelings about getting abortion pills online, but Abortion On Demand has been a great experience for me. I think it\u2019s great for women who have no access to clinics or simply just don\u2019t want to go to one. I can answer any questions. I hope this helps.",

        "body": "...and I absolutely am suffering from it. Before I get into my feeling I'll give some background. I am a 23 year old woman who lives at home. I barely have any savings and the savings I do have is for me to buy a car. I rely on my aunt to take me to work and occasionally ask my dad or use uber/lyft to get to different locations. My current place of employment is a terrible place to work. I am exhausted all the time, I feel depressed being there because the employees are expected to work none stop with barely any breaks and no social interaction. On top of that it doesnt pay enough to live off of. Growing up, my mother was in and out of my life. (She had me at 20.) There were times she would want to raise me then when it got too hard she would take me back to my grandmothers or aunts house. My father was there at times but wasn't in my life really until I was a teenager. (He was 21.) Looking thinking back this was a factor to my depression.\n\nI battled with depression since I was 5 or 6 after my grandmothers death until I was in college. I finally got help for my depression when I was raped (the pregnancy was not from this incident). After a few years on anti depressants, I stopped taking them earlier this year because I felt like I didn't need them. Because I have been depressed all of my life, I never felt I ever learned to be myself and have been working to come out of my shell so I could have some confidence, learn to be social so I can have a social life and network with professionals without feeling inadequate. I wanted you live a life that didn't consist of being a room all day because I had no one or nothing to do.\n\nSo with all of this, I had decided while I was a junior in college that if I ever got pregnant I would terminate the pregnancy and stayed consistent with my decision throughout the years. Then I got pregnant. I knew I was pregnant after the father and I had sex. He kept asking me to take the condom off and eventually I just caved and let him do it but I told him to not cum inside me. However, he did it anyway. He acted like it wasn't a big deal and he wanted me to cuddle with him. After that I just left because I was so upset. He followed me outside and told me it was my fault because he said that he told me that he was gonna cum and inside me and I said OK in between moans. I don't remember this happening. I told him he was lying. He was trying get me to stay but I was so upset that I just left. The next day I took plan B but it didn't work because I am 255lbs.\n\nLike I said I knew I was pregnant from the beginning. I didn't feel like myself and I was having morning sickness like 2 weeks into my pregnancy. So I took a pregnancy test and unsurprisingly I was pregnant. I was in a state of shock the entire time I was pregnant. I couldn't believe it. But after learning I was pregnant, I kinda wanted to keep it but the logical part of me knew it wasn't the right time and the father was a great guy. I was really resented being pregnant and I felt like this was something that happened to me. I felt like I was going to resent my baby too if I had it. I always felt like that my mom resented having me in some capacity. I always felt like that if she had an abortion her life would have been better without me really everyone's lives would have been better. Plus I would have been a fetus so I wouldn't have any pain or feelings if she did terminate. However, even with feeling that way, looking back, I realized I was conflicted and also wanted to have my baby, hold my baby, and meet my baby but I suppressed my emotions and listened to the logical part of myself and not my heart. I thought it was reckless to have a baby out of emotion while not having the proper resources. But right now my heart is devastated.\n\nThe man who got me pregnant was in same boat as me. He didnt have any money and was living at home. When we were together he would hardly answer my text or phone calls even when I was pregnant. When I told him I was pregnant, we talked about it but he said it was my decision. However, there was a instance when I was bleeding and it was a lot. He seemed upset that I was bleeding and thought the baby was gone. But he never called to check up on me and when I had the first doctors appointment he claimed he would be there but he never showed up. Then, when I got upset about it, he said that he's going through a lot and I needed to bare with him and how I'm hurting his feelings. I did apologize but I don't recall him ever saying he was sorry for not showing up even though he said he understood why I was upset. Then, when I decided to terminate my pregnancy, he said he wanted to be there. However when the day came I called and texted him and he didn't answer nor showed up. Again, I was alone in a room filled with people who had their baby fathers with them to support through the process. \n\nWhen I was about to have to abortion it suddenly became real to me. I realized I'm really am pregnant not even the ultrasounds woke up to the fact that was pregnant. I didn't allow myself to think of this was what I really wanted I just decided go ahead with it because I thought I would feel relieved. But when it was over, I felt sadness. Since the day after I had my abortion, I been having crying fits, feelings of regret and the desire to get pregnant again. I keep thinking that I could have keep my baby and I would be better off if I did. I miss being pregnant. I miss my baby but I can't get him/her back because they are gone. I feel like even if I become financially stable and live the life I wanted isnt worth it because I dont have baby with me. My crying fits have gotten so bad that I am now hyperventilating. I'm crying more frequently and longer. I just really miss my baby. I know that a lot of it is the hormones but I feel like I might be slipping back into a depression. I was concerned about getting depressed after having a baby but I didnt even think this could happen after having an abortion. This decision has been terrible for me. I want to just go back in time and keep my baby. ",

        "body": "It\u2019s been just over a week since I had my abortion. I know there are a lot of hormonal side effects from it, so I\u2019ve been trying to be as rational and as logical as I can be as I process my thoughts and making sure I\u2019m not just getting carried away with hormonal wackiness. \n\nA few weeks ago I realized I was pregnant. I\u2019m not going to go through all of the details, but the cliff notes are that, like many other folks, there was a certain set of circumstances that would have made this an extremely tough situation to explain and deal with. This goes beyond if I have ever wanted children or not. To be clear, I don\u2019t currently have any children and had never been pregnant before.\n\nI have a demanding job, in terms of travel and time. And given the ticking time bomb to make a decision about this before I get to a stage where a) the procedure is even way less friendly/more difficult and painful  to have and b) I might actually start to look pregnant and can\u2019t hide it anymore\u2026. I felt like I had to rush into a decision.  With everything going on with the aftermath of Roe v Wade, along with my already fully booked travel schedule, I was afraid I wouldn\u2019t be able to get anywhere in time before I hit a certain amount of weeks that was going to start making things more complicated. Plus I was full of symptoms and it was starting to get hard for me to function in my daily life and I\u2019m sure those around me might have started to get suspicious.\n\nI was somehow able to get an appointment a week later and I think I was at about 6 weeks when I had my SA. You can probably see my previous post on here because I was very afraid of getting one with any sort of sedation.\n\nAt first, I was so relieved. I avoided dealing with what would have been an extremely difficult situation on so many levels. I was scared, but to be clear, I never felt forced into this and felt this is what I needed and wanted to do. \n\nA few days later, and I am bleeding and cramping and starting to feel side effects of the procedure. I start to think more about what I did. This is not meant to spark debate, but I started to think about how I did kill something that I helped to create. I am not saying that at 6 weeks that I think a fetus is a person, nor am I going to claim I know if at 30 weeks it should be considered one either. But I do recognize this was a growing organism, clearly alive in some capacity. \n\nI start thinking about how I rushed into my decision. Much of it revolves around how I felt like I didn\u2019t have much time to decide. I know that choosing to continue the pregnancy would have resulted in an uncomfortable situation, but I can\u2019t sit here and say I can\u2019t afford it, that the dad is an asshat, or anything of the like. That doesn\u2019t mean that others to choose to have an abortion who have a similar scenario are wrong to do so, but I personally feel like I could have thought more about this and maybe decided to continue and choose to accept the situation instead of immediately thinking I should run away.\n\nIt got me thinking about my beliefs. People are so polar about this and everyone seems to think you have to be so black and white about it. I realized that I am pro life in a sense I will always encourage someone to try to at least finish the pregnancy, even if it results in adoption. Obviously there are so many scenarios where someone medically shouldn\u2019t or personal situations that are mentally unhealthy (I.e. rape, abuse, insanely young). But regardless, while I personally feel pro life, I also believe in pro choice, for whatever reason that person has for wanting to terminate. It\u2019s not for me to say why someone should or shouldn\u2019t get an abortion. \n\nI regret not considering my options more. I knew all the options, but I let myself just focus on the one that gave me least discomfort. I feel like I personally could have found a way to make this work. I think about how I could have provided a good life for a child but just chose not to and I don\u2019t feel confident that I made the right decision. I speak just for myself. I really do believe in pro choice. But now having gone through this myself, there is a part of me that would always want to try for life first if possible. \n\nI hope this makes sense. In no way is this meant to be a dig at anyone who chooses to have an abortion for any reason. I guess it just means I feel like I can appreciate both sides of the aisle and how people make their decisions and how hard it can really be.",

You are already aware of your own great potential, he only helped you see it, which means you're capable without him. \n\nNow to save his own relationship with her, and his own career and education,  he left you for her despite his own terrible choices and actions that negatively affect you. Yet he still wants to be friends?  Why does he get to walk away unscathed? What right or privilege is that? \n\nSo she doesn't know,  he doesn't get in trouble. \nYou abort, he doesn't have to be a father,  saving his own career/ and education, but you have to deal with the guilt of knowing your the side-piece secret, the physical,  psychological, emotional recovery from the abortion no one really talks about, while you try to finish school?\n\nYet he still wants the privilege of being in your life, \"as a friend\", despite the mess your going through because of  his dishonestly and your naivity? \n\nRecall the powers of position here.\n\nWhy is that OK? How is that nice or honorable? \nIt's not, it's selfish.\n\nDo your parents even know about the other girl and that he has chosen her over you, now that you're pregnant?

Not giving him the privilege to be in your life. \n\nI really hope you can see what I'm trying to convey to you. You need to take back your power,  believe in your self,  and don't allow people to ruin your life and then keep them around either, just bc they are \"nice\" or had a positive effect on you to a point. His poor behavior and true colors are glaring at you, and you appear to refuse to be honest with yourself. \n\nBe honest with yourself,  you deserve it. This is an opportunity to make a decision on what you allow in your life and the things that will come with it. Don't be a participant in self-manufacturing your own hurt and pain by allowing him to be in your life. \n\nI made the Dean's/Honor's list while depressed and recovered from abortion, I was alone, no one was there to inspire me or motivate me.

He can't have it all,  and you shouldn't allow it. Please consider that him offering to be your friend is a way to keep you around. There may be selfish reasons. He may seem wonderful, but the stain of his and your choices are now manifesting both your characters. \n\nYou're appear utterly vulnerable bc of the position of power,  you seem to be in love with him or at least what he wants you to believe, now pregnant. \n\nYou need to open your eyes that this is all terribly wrong, and I hope you find the strength to see reason. \n\nFinally, him sleeping with more that two people is a risk for all three of you. I hope it's not worse than that. Protect yourself. \n\nIt's time to give yourself the ultimatum: choose peace, prevention, values, & self-respect. Or long-standing hurt, disrespect, sexual risk if you choose to not let go of him. You choosing to still allow him in your life, is you also allowing your self to be hurt.\n\nIf you leave him, you'll feel hurt for a while, but at some point you'll be relieved you ended such risk and chaos.",

When a person abuses  an unequal power dynamic to initiate an intimate relationship with no intention of equalizing the power, there is something wrong. There is an underlying gratification the person in power gets from  the dominance.  It will continue in your \u201cfriendship\u201d as it\u2019s likely meeting some need he has at your expense.\n\nPlease consider that not only is he knowingly abusing his power as a teacher, he will likely do it again. He already crossed the ethics boundary. Now it\u2019s easy to do it again. He may have done it before. \n\nDr./patient, teacher/student, boss/employee, These are all unequal power structures where professional ethics dictate crossing the boundaries are wrong. \n\nIt\u2019s also possible that in being his \u201cfriend\u201d that you will not seek healthy and loving truly equal relationships while a part of you continues to hold out hope he will change is mind.

I know he feels the same way and in a perfect world we would be together (still wouldnt keep the baby, but it would make things easier). the problem is that he has a girlfriend who he loves just as much, and who has ~5 years on me. yes I know I\u2019m stupid for allowing this to go on so long knowing damn well hes in a happy relationship. but our connection is undeniable. hes told me he sees a future with me too and that it\u2019s possible he\u2019ll break up with her and be with me, so I stayed and waited and hoped for him to choose me. and honestly its been the best 8mo of my life hes made me the happiest ive ever been and has shown me so much love. he really is a genuinely good person. this pregnancy was a shock for both of us and it forced him into making a decision. and he chose her, which absolutely broke me I\u2019m in shambles never felt so much sadness in my life. I\u2019m getting the abortion (5 weeks btw) in a couple days and I just dont know how to be okay. I feel so stupid for ending up in this position. hes being extremely supportive and I am thankful for him. we decided to stay friends, which is something I do really want. under the love I have for him he is still my best friend and the most important person in my life. I dont know how to navigate a friendship with someone im in love with, or if it will ever really work, but we are trying. part of me wants to tell his girlfriend what happened, but it would ruin my relationship with him completely. also I think it should come from him but he refuses. \nto add a layer, he also happens to be my TA this semester. the class is on reproductive physiology and we literally spent 2 months learning about sex, pregnancy etc. the fucking irony.\n\n*edit. why I want to stay friends:\n1. he has met my parents and my best friend, all of whom love him and see him as an amazing friend to me - he has done a lot for me and them\n2. I\u2019ve been going to the gym with him every day. he drives. working out is like therapy for me I\u2019ve struggled with depression for a long time and the lifestyle approach has been really good for me. he motivates me and has made me actually enjoy working out\n3. I\u2019ve always wanted to be a dr. but never felt smart enough &amp; thought I wouldnt get into med school &amp; hes pushed me and made me realize my potential. he is the reason I started studying for the mcat in january. we have plans to study together closer to the date and take the exam same day/place\n4. I\u2019m stuck with him at least until ~late april anyways because he is my TA (teacher assistant) meaning hes marking my papers/ exams and there\u2019s mandatory zoom tutorials I have to see him at weekly.\n\n\nif I was strong and confident enough in myself I know none of that should matter but I see my mental health being far worse off losing him as a friend too",

This is a negative post but this is an HONEST post. I am a 21F in the US and was 5 weeks along at the time of the abortion. \n\nI had my medical abortion about a week ago and I am still cramping terribly every single day. I took the pills exactly as prescribed to start the bleeding at home, and I took the pain meds 30 minutes before as instructed to. I have been taking the pain meds around the clock since. The pain is still so bad that it is waking me up from sleep, and it is not managed with pain meds, heating pad, uterine massage, or anything else imaginable. \n\nThis was the worst and most painful experience of my life. I get ovarian cysts monthly and incredibly painful/heavy periods, and this pain was 100 times worse than that. I wish I was exaggerating but I am not. \n\nThe worst part is there is nothing medically wrong like an infection. I have called the 800 number Planned Parenthood gave me 3 times in a week (as instructed to when pain is not managed by the prescriptions) and they say that there is nothing to indicate an infection and I must be having a bad reaction to it. They advised me that there is no need to go to the ER at this time. \n\nIf I could go back in time, I would have kept the pregnancy, or at the very least done a surgical abortion because at least it would have been over in a few minutes and maybe the cramping wouldn\u2019t be so bad. I didn\u2019t want this option because it seemed more invasive, but the staff at Planned Parenthood said that with how early I was (5 weeks), a medical abortion seemed best. They said I should feel back to normal on Day 3 with some period-like bleeding still. It is now Day 6 and I still feel terrible. \n\nFor everyone saying they felt better after a couple days, I envy you immensely. I am angry and disappointed and so frustrated and honestly would have kept the pregnancy at this point. I already suffer from depression and anxiety and this has made me feel so much worse. I am terrified I will never feel back to normal. It is not the bleeding that has bothered me. It is the intense, debilitating pain I have experienced that I was not educated or informed about. I expected cramps slightly worse than period cramps, but nothing as terrible as this. My eyes are puffy from how much I\u2019ve cried.\n\nI will post an update in about a week after my follow up, but I am incredibly unhappy with my decision, and would encourage women to not see other posts on this forum particularly and assume that their experience will be okay. I have seen no other posts on here detailing my type of experience and I felt the need to post mine to show people both sides of the spectrum.",

        "body": "Hi. I\u2019m feeling really alone and upset and would love some supportive words.\n\nI recently found out I was pregnant. We already have a two year old and have \u201cagreed\u201d that we won\u2019t have any more until I\u2019m done my residency (another 3 years away). I put \u2018agreed\u2019 in quotations because he\u2019s very adamant about no more until then, whereas I\u2019m more open. I\u2019ve always wanted lots of kids. Anyway, when I found out I was pregnant I spent 3 or 4 days stunned (yet hopeful and happy about it), planning out how I can make this work financially and still finish residency on time, etc etc. As well as planning how I would tell my husband, knowing he would explode and demand I get an abortion.\n\nWell, no matter how much wishful thinking I had, there was no convincing him once I told him the news. He claims that I breached his trust because I contemplated keeping the baby (since we agreed on no more kids, and that if a \u2018whoopsie\u2019 happened, I would get an abortion). He\u2019s been quite selfish (I\u2019m being biased but whatever), saying he\u2019s absolutely not ready for another baby (Which I get!) and basically forcing me into an abortion. He\u2019s paralleling his own behaviour from when we found out we were pregnant with baby #1- we were unmarried, finishing up our undergrads and the pregnancy was completely unplanned. He cornered me into an abortion then too; I agreed at a certain point, but then knowing I couldn\u2019t go through with it, told him that I made the decision to keep it and that he could walk if he wanted. Well, he didn\u2019t walk, but I essentially lived in emotional isolation for half of my pregnancy. It was hell. \n\nAnyway. It\u2019s been a full 30 hours since I\u2019ve told him and I haven\u2019t stopped crying. I eventually told him yesterday \u201cfine, I\u2019ll get the abortion\u201d and he\u2019s since stopped being so emotionally cold. But he also is displaying 0 empathy besides continually asking \u201cso when are you booking the appointment?\u201d, essentially acting like it\u2019s no big deal, he isn\u2019t being as ass, and like I\u2019m not super upset and hurt. \n\nAnyway. I just needed an outlet to let out some emotion. I\u2019m very very very pro choice, but abortion isn\u2019t something I feel like I can do personally myself; I know this is something I\u2019m going to regret for the rest of my life and I hate myself for it. Thanks for reading.\n\nTL;DR: Husband is demanding that I get an abortion whereas I do not want one. I\u2019m feeling very emotionally isolated and already very remorseful of the prospective abortion.",

Those women who carried to term were prepared and ready to make sacrifices that they in no way were obligated to make. You are not obligated, and your choice to terminate is valid. I personally view my abortion as putting things back to the way they were. My eggs are alive and human. My boyfriend's sperm was alive and human. The zygote they created together was alive and human, but all of those living cells are missing the key to life as we understand it- the ability to think, to feel the world around us, to empathize and understand what it means to make choices and interact in this world. When you take the life of a child that has been born, you are robbing that child's new sense of what it means to be alive. An embryo has not reached that point, and it doesn't matter if it could have, just as it doesn't matter if you had not had sex that day and your living egg was not fertilized. \n\nThat's my view and I hope it can help you some. Please don't feel that I'm pushing this mindset on you. I wish you all the best, and I know you did what is right. You are strong, compassionate, and you deserve the world\u2764\u2764\u2764",

The father is a man I've been with for about 8 months. He's good. He's good to me, he's attentive and nice and I think he really cares for me as I care for him. Anyway, I had a very stressful couple of weeks and missed taking the pill for, I think it was three days, but wasn't aware and we had unprotected sex and this happened. This is not the time for me to be pregnant, it may never be, but now as I am looking for a job it cannot happen because nobody is going to hire me if I go pregnant to interviews and then if this guy just ditches me how am I gonna sustain myself? \n\nSo, anyway, I found out this week, set the appointment and I'm certain of what I'm going to do. Meanwhile he is on a business trip for a month in a country in South America. I didn't tell him because I feel guilty, you know? It was my fault, I was careless, I just want to be done with this. But then I started having doubts, should he know? And now he's going this weekend on a sightseeing trip while I'll be stuck there feeling miserable and I kind of would like support? But then again it was my bad and now it kind of feels like I'm doing it out of spite because he gets to go on this trip. \n\nI just don't know how I'm supposed to feel or what I'm supposed to do. This is all so strange for me. So any advice would go a long way. I haven't collected the guts to tell anyone close to me, I feel isolated. \n\nThank you",

I\u2019m currently 12 weeks pregnant according to my last period but it doesn\u2019t make sense. I say it does not make sense because I had sex 2 weeks after I finished my period. I am a bit nervous about getting the procedure done this Friday for the reason of how far along I am. \n\nWhen I went to the doctors to confirm my suspension of being pregnant I didn\u2019t get to see my physician. Instead of getting my primary doctor I got to see a nurse partitioner. She gave me the news and I burst out crying because I am not ready to be a mother. I told her I thought long and hard about my options, that I have settled for an abortion. Instead of giving me the resources she started telling me that there were other options. Again I told her that I explored all those options but I could not go through the pregnancy because it is not the right time to add on to that from the beginning of the pregnancy I have felt upset and unhappy instead of feeling happy or joyful about the pregnancy. She kept insisting about going through it and told me there were support groups to go through it. Again I told her that I can\u2019t go through the pregnancy with tears running down my face. She then continue to ask me if I was religious or if my family was religious. I said yes my family is then she continue to say how would your mom feel about your decision, how would god see you because you know it\u2019s a baby, a life. She then told me there was a reason why I came to the doctor\u2019s because she assumed that I was unsure of wanting an abortion. I then told her I came here because my insurance covered pregnancy tests and I would need a referral from my provider to cover my abortion cost. That\u2019s when she told me she was pro life and that she would not be able to provide me with the resources to be able to get an abortion. I could not believe this instead she gave me a sheet of women\u2019s shelters and prescribed prenatal vitamins. I felt like I wasn\u2019t being heard or understood. I was shocked that a medical professional didn\u2019t put their patient\u2019s needs first. This was the first time I was really upset with my healthcare provider Kaiser. She made me feel attacked and forced to go through a pregnancy that I did not want to. I wonder if any of you guys have had gone through a similar situation.\n\nI ended up contacting Kaiser and they told me that I could easily get a referral to get the procedure done through a telephone appointment. I could not believe I had to do all of this on my own and have more stress added to my plate. I am going through the procedure because I\u2019m just 23 years old and applying to med schools at the moment. A baby right now would not be ideal for me because I still live with my parents and help me with my school expenses still. So I don\u2019t even have the courage to tell them that I am pregnant. Also my boyfriend and I have been together for almost five years and we have never had a scared. I could be doing him wrong but I don\u2019t have the courage to tell him I am pregnant for the reason he suffers from major depression. Plus I feel like I know how he would feel about this, that we aren\u2019t ready to be parents. For the exact reason that he is as well trying to go to grad school. I hope I\u2019m not being selfish about this decision but I feel like it\u2019s the right thing to do. \n\nI\u2019ll keep you guys updated, thanks for reading.\n",

I am so sorry that you tried to be responsible and have your tubes tied, but it didn't work out for you.  I am so sorry that you physically would be at high risk and that you would mentally and financially be even more burdened with another child.  \n\nI said I am a pro-choice...and I really am...but I am a gay dude, what judgement do I have to make on the matter?  It's easy to say I am pro-choice when I am not the one having to make the decisions or deal with the fallback.  \n\nI don't judge you one bit and I think you are just trying to be a strong mama bear to the little ones you already have.  It's truly sad that you have to go through this, because I can see that it is a struggle for you but you don't see any other options.\n\nI don't know the specifics of what you are going through, so I won't even attempt to understand or criticize them.  Abortions can never be black and white, and I have no idea what I would do if I was in a position like you are.  \n\nYou seem like a beautiful person who has so much to live for, and I can't imagine you having to put your life at risk for anyone or anything.  Be strong and reach out to a counselor if you feel like you need it.  \n \nIt's an absolutely horrible feeling when you have to make a decision between a giant douche and a turd sandwich(thank you, South Park) but you're a strong woman and your maternal instincts will kick in and you will find your peace with whatever decision turns out to be best.\n\nIn the meantime, talk about your feelings...express them to your husband, your family, your friends...don't carry this burden alone.  Maybe you will get some good insight, maybe you will just get a shoulder to cry on, but life is really tough sometimes and you will prevail.\n\nStay strong, hugs.",

Then my husband would be stuck for 5 more years at a job that makes him miserable.\n\nAnd my kids. My precious babies. Of the 4 of them, half are twins. One is autistic. One has ADHD. The oldest are just my 4 year old twins and the youngest just 8 months old.\n\nThat many kids in such a short time. I'm stretched thin as it is and for the sake of all my babies, and especially two having varying degrees if special needs, I can't stretch further.\n\nThe real kicker here? When my daughter was born 8 months ago I had my tubes tied. Because I knew I couldn't handle another unexpected pregnancy and I never wanted to have to make this choice.\n\n\nThere's no way it would work to keep this pregnancy. The quality of life in our entire family would drop so drastically.\n\n\nWhy didn't my fucking tubal work???? Why is this happening???? Were things really just not hard enough yet????\n\n\nIts killing me. I feel like I'm already grieving. I don't know how to explain that this is still a loss to me. I'm so devastated. I'm so devastated I have to make this choice.\n\n\nI would have 10 kids if I had unlimited money and time. I've wanted to be a mother since I was 5, that's been my purpose to exist. I exist to love and nurture and grow. But I HAVE to do this. This is what's killing me.\n\n\nI don't want to do this but its the only way our family as it is can stay afloat and happy.\n\n\nIs it ridiculous to seek out a therapist for grieving? I feel so stupid. I feel like I'm not even entitled to feel like it's a loss because I'm making this choice.\n\nBecause I had my tubes tied there's a chance it's ectopic and i hope SO BAD that it is. It wouldn't feel great either, still loss, But it would take this burden of a decision out of my hands.\n\n\nI'm so scared. We won't have the money in time to do a medical abortion, so surgical it is. I would so much rather deal with it at home, in bed, with my husband holding me but instead I have to just wake up cold and empty. They won't even allow him past the lobby. I totally understand why policies like that exist but Fuck, I wish he could hold my hand through it.\n\n\nHe keeps trying to reassure me and he says \"it's not the end of the world, we'll be okay\" and \"no one has to know.\"\n\n\nGoddamnit, *I* have to know. And it's not the end of the world, but it hurts so bad. This is by far the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with.\n\n\nI've always been pro-choice without a doubt, But for myself could never foresee any circumstance that I'd have one myself. Until this. I know a lot of women feel overwhelmed with relief when they have one, and know without a doubt it was a good choice.\n\nBut I don't know if I am one of them. My mother instinct is so fucking strong and already telling me to love and nurture this thing and I fucking can't. What if I mentally scar myself for life? What if I never get over this? What if this triggers another deep depression?\n\nI can't. I can't go through with this pregnancy. I can't. Each pregnancy I've had has been high risk and has become increasingly life threatening to me and I can't risk that. I have too many little people and my husband that need me and I can't even slightly risk that.\n\n\nI'm so angry. I'm so fucking angry, I wish I had someone to blame. But it just happened. It just unfortunately happened. For some reason a sperm and an ovum were able to meet after I had a surgery to prevent that, and now I have to find some way to make peace with this within the next 3 weeks. I feel like it's my fault. I feel like I did something wrong.",

                    "body": "Have you discussed your stances on abortion prior to having this conversation?\n\n1. I can\u2019t see why a woman would tell you she had an abortion in an attempt to try and \u201ckeep\u201d you when abortion is so heavily stigmatized that most women anticipate the opposite outcome (their partner leaving them, holding resentment towards them, domestic violence, the fear of your medical history being shared without your consent, etc. etc.). Moreover, I think a lot of men have a mismatched reality of how many women actually want to thwart themselves into intense financial, emotional, and biological instability in an attempt to stay with a man who isn\u2019t matching the emotional connection she desires. Add a national pandemic into the mix of everything I mentioned and yeah, not particularly appealing to a lot of people. \n\n2. Personally, I would be far less likely to disclose an experience as difficult as abortion to someone who doesn\u2019t seem to care about me. I would be much less likely to tell someone that I\u2019m not even dating. Although you may think that your idea that she is untrustworthy may not be apparent to her, it\u2019s likely she\u2019s sensed your general feelings towards her already. Most people are not readily vulnerable to people who dislike them, especially in an incredibly emotionally taxing situation; she may not feel comfortable sharing more with you (an accusation from you would prove her discomfort and make her feel much, much worse). She didn\u2019t have to tell you she got an abortion in the first place.\n\n3. If you are a troubled by what you perceive is nonchalance, it is likely she is seeking emotional and physical support elsewhere, from friends or family. She probably spent a lot of time even debating telling you about the procedure due to the level of your relationship, her personal experience, background, etc. Everyone handles abortion differently. \n\n4. It would be wrong to ask for proof from someone who just underwent a difficult procedure. It isn\u2019t her obligation. Her telling you wasn\u2019t her obligation. Please do not use that against her. \n\nI understand that the unfamiliarity and fear may be significant for you; the idea of having a child when you aren\u2019t ready can be terrifying! It\u2019s easy for anxiety to snowball. I understand that and I\u2019m sorry the idea is keeping you up at night. It can be terrifying to feel as though your imminent future has changed dramatically. Now amplify that to the extent that you are the one actually undergoing the LIVED EXPERIENCE of the changes to your body, stigma, and all scopes of pain. Empathize and imagine that you were the one that to make the appointments, experience side effects, all alongside being berated by people who are accusing you of evil. Imagine being the person making the final decision.\n\n5. In the future, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to be in a sexual relationship with someone you cannot trust on such a fundamental level- for your wellbeing and for hers. \n\n6. You will find out eventually. For now, because your body is no longer involved in this experience, it\u2019s not your place to push further.",

I try to block out such event in my life but any time I see a baby, pregnant woman, etc I remember how that could've been me, how far along would I be now, how would my life pan out to be, where would I have lived, how would the baby be raised, etc. I think of all the what if's too. But I also think that, it just wouldn't have been ideal. The baby would have had parents that didn't expect or desired it initially, god forbid we can't get our mental health in order and ever have resentment for the baby, I know it sucks ever knowing your parents resenting your existence and I wouldn't want that for anyone. I feel like someone, me, baby, dad, parents, someone would get hurt somewhere and so I took the hurt. My parents too probably would be hurt knowing they've been asking for grandkids, for me to get married, for me to date someone nice so they can have grandkids, etc - and here I am aborting what they want just because I don't want to possibly resent a baby I didn't plan for. So I kept it to myself and made the decision. More so I didn't want to have a baby and feel like I didn't plan for it and it cut my \"life\" short by giving it life. It's just all so selfish I feel. I too felt maternal and all sorts of ways once I found out I was pregnant. I already felt responsible that I was carrying a baby, sort of helpless like I wanted the dads support emotionally, mentally, physically even though I was only 5 weeks along. I was already going slightly nuts or at least not actng like myself thinking straight anymroe. So now I'm just left with \"I wonder / what ifs\" but telling myself it's better that I take the guilt now than to risk putting a baby/kid through a life that's not the most welcoming for them.",

For a year after both I had to unfollow/mute/unfriend every woman that posted about their pregnancy on my social media. Even what would be my sister in law if I were married. That seemed okay. But even still to this day I find myself doing it. I feel guilt, and horrible on Mother\u2019s Day. I\u2019ve written a letter to my unborn child in my journal that makes me cry every time I see it. Is not being able to handle other pregnant women for this long normal? For me it\u2019s a mixed bag of jealousy, hurt, frustration, anger, depression, and anxiety. I didn\u2019t want to have the first one at all but came around when my partner told me how he felt. When it happened again I already knew what he was going to say which hurt a lot the first time so I just did it all again a little more willingly because I knew what to expect. But I know if I would have had a supportive partner I wouldn\u2019t have done that. Sometimes it makes me angry that pregnant women don\u2019t think about how much they\u2019re hurting women who are not mothers but want to be. I wish I could just post a status saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry but if you\u2019re posting weekly or monthly updates on your pregnancy I can\u2019t look at it right now and for my mental health I have to mute you.\u201d But we all know how that would go over. It sucks we can\u2019t be open about it. Does anyone else feel like this?",

I took a home pregnancy test which came out positive, so I made a same day appointment to get a pregnancy test at PP. I am definitely pregnant. \n\nI have PCOS (amongst a million other health issues) and have been on birth control for three years. For me to miss a period was not a red flag, and I so wish that I was regular because now I have no idea how far along I am and I am terrified I'll be unable to get an abortion (my last period was january 1st but now I'm questioning if it was just spotting). What would I do then?\n\nI'm completely alone. I come from an extremely religious family and I don't trust anyone enough to tell them what's happening because I fear harsh judgement and complete rejection. Making an appointment for an abortion proved to be another hurdle. The next one available is March 20, and today is only February 27. \n\nI have no doubt in my mind that I will terminate, but I wish I didn't have to do this alone. The anxiety of not knowing how far along I am & if i'd be eligible at all is killing me. Any support or advice would be appreciated. \n\nUpdate #1: I found a place that can get me in Tuesday, 03/06 HOORAY so I will not have an entire month of pure anxiety. In Texas they make you do 2 separate appointments. The first one is to do an ultrasound & they force you to get misleading information called \"A Women's Right to Know\" hahaha but it's better than nothing. \nI'm super thankful for this forum & for everyone who has responded so far. I'll update again next week.\nUpdate #2: I had my ultrasound appointment this morning (03/06) and it went well. It turns out i\u2019m 6 weeks pregnant and well under the limitations which is a huge sigh of relief. I opted for the surgical abortion which will be done next week and i\u2019ll make a final post about my experiences which hopefully can help someone out like you all have helped me.",

I say people of all genders because not everyone who is biologically able to become pregnant (and thus able to choose abortion) identifies as female. And also, people who are able to become pregnant and choose abortion have partners of all different genders. The problem occurs when male-identified people behave as though they have the right to decide whether someone else has an abortion or how that abortion takes place. To be clear, I believe that pregnancy decisions belong primarily to the pregnant person. Carrying a pregnancy to term is an extremely involved process, emotionally and physically. I don't believe it should be forced on anyone. The same is true for raising a child. However, many people who are considering abortion (or adoption or parenting) may choose to make that decision along with a partner/friend/family member. Male partners are certainly allowed to have opinions and feelings about abortion. What they shouldn't be allowed to do is control who has access to abortion. This applies to partners, friends, family members, politicians, doctors, insurance and pharmaceutical companies, etc. Abortion is a personal decision that should be made primarily by the pregnant person!

        "body": "~MY ABORTION STORY~\n\nMy life is deeply effected by this trauma I faced in my life. I honestly never wanted to have an abortion. I wanted my baby badly. But I was so scared that no one would help me. Taking care of a baby on my own would have been a big change. Everyone told me abortion is the best option. Feeling alone was the worst feeling ever. Now I am left with this hurt for the rest of my life.I feel regret and sadness. I wish I could go back and take my baby back. When I see other babies or children it reminds me of what I could of had. Finding out someone is pregnant hits me the most. I feel my baby would have been a girl. I gave her the name Kacey Hope\n\nFrom the beginning of May 2010 I noticed I was gaining weight. I never wanted to believe of the possibility of being pregnant. On May 12, 2010 my life changed.  I went to the Birth Control Clinic at the London-Middlesex Health Unit. I went for S.T.I Testing. During the testing they did a pregnancy test. I was waiting in a room. The doctor walked in and paused. He goes \" You are pregnant\". I was starting to cry and said \"Are you sure that cant be wrong\". He said \"No, you are at least 4 weeks pregnant\". I started crying a lot and said \" I want an abortion right now\". They said I couldn't unless I went to Toronto. So they gave me a phone number to call. That night I couldn't even sleep. I was so devastated that I had a little baby growing inside of me.\n\nOn May 13, 2010, I called the Woman\u2019s Health Clinic at Victoria Hospital to book an abortion. They said I had to wait until I was 8 weeks. They booked my ultrasound for June 4, 2010. During my wait the morning sickness started. It was horrible I was getting sick every day. I would go on the internet and look up week by week how big the baby got. I was very fascinated by it. There were times I really wanted to keep the baby. Fear took over though. The fear of giving birth, raising a baby, and adoption all scared me. I was so consumed in worry and there was no one to help me raise this child. So I went forward with the easy way out even though I really didn't want too.\n\nOn June 4, 2010 my friend picked me up from my place to take me to the ultrasound. I went in alone, I was in this alone. This lady put jelly on my belly and told me to just lay down. This was my very first and only ultrasound. I asked \"Do you see it?\" She said \"Yes, do you want to see?\" I agreed with some excitement. She turned the screen towards me and I could make out everything. I saw the shape of the babies face and head. She pointed to a little circle moving and said \"Do you see that?\" I said \"Yes\", She said \"That is the beating heart\". I asked her how far along I was. She told me I was 8 weeks and 4 days. When I got home I did a lot of thinking on way's I could possibly keep this baby. I came up with many, but fear would always make me think, abortion is probably the best thing. I even prayed to God and asked him to help me think of something before it was too late. I continued to look up on the computer how big the baby was. The morning sickness continued daily until the pregnancy was terminated. Every night, I would touch my belly, to see if I could feel anything moving. I started to feel love for this child.\n\nJune 18, 2010, would be the last day this baby had life in me. It was the worst feeling in my whole life. I wanted something or someone to stop me. I felt so alone. My friend and I went to Victoria Hospital at 7a.m. The appointment was at 7:30a.m.  When I got there I was led into a room with a lot of people.  They gave me a gown and slippers to put on.  I was in bed for a half hour until they told me to take two white pills. Once you take these pills, you can't change your mind. Then they put an IV in my left hand. As I sat there with my friend, I noticed a lot of women, especially young, walking in. They where all crying. I could tell why, they where in there for the same reason I was. I asked my friend \"How come I am not crying?\", he told me it was because I was thinking more about myself instead of this little one inside of me. I didn't believe that though. I did care about this baby.\n\nAt 8 30am it was time for me to go to the operating room to have the abortion. They put some sleeping medicine in my IV and I made the doctors laugh when I said I feel funny. They held a breathing mask to my face and within 10 seconds I fell asleep. I woke up in the recovery room. I was only asleep for a half hour. I was no longer pregnant. My little one is no longer growing inside of me. I let my baby go to heaven. I let my baby go at 11 weeks\n\n~LIFE AFTER ABORTION~\n\nI will never forget the day I first saw my baby. June 4, 2010, my life changed. I watched the beating heart of my 8 week unborn baby on an ultrasound screen. I really do miss this now. I always play it in my mind again and again. Laying on the bed, watching my babies heart move. It was a living human being. I aborted my child 14 days later. June 18, 2010 this babies little heart stopped. A part of me died that day, and life after that never got easier. The loss of a child to abortion is so tormenting. I feel like something is missing that should be here. I honestly never wanted to have an abortion. I desperately wanted this child. I wanted to raise this child. The thought of having to bring up a child on my own with no help scared me. So, I took the easy way out. Now, life for me is much different then before I got pregnant. I struggle with depression over my decision. When I see other babies and toddlers, it reminds me what I should have.I missed out on the opportunity to be a mother to my baby. Sometimes I get scared and think, what if I never have another baby? What If I never get that second chance to be a mother? What if this was the only baby I would of ever had? I feel a deep loss for this baby that I never had. It also effected my life a lot in many ways. I have lost friends, because of what I chose to do. I had people who I thought were friends go around and tell others what I did. A lot of people talked behind my back negatively. I have been criticized and told I was a horrible person for killing my child. People tell me that I shouldn't feel regret. It was my decision and I should just live with it. This is in no way an easy thing to live with. I experienced 12 weeks of a life growing inside of me. I felt the morning sickness the whole time. I had all the pregnancy symptoms. i know what it feels like to carry a child that I love inside of the womb. I sometimes think what the child would have looked like and been like. I make up fake memories as to what life would have been if my baby were here. I do know that God does forgive me and that my baby is in heaven. I will meet her someday. I will always love my little one.",

Fortunately, **you do not have to be a father**. You cannot be forced to take an active role in the child's life and it was not your choice to bring the child into the world. You do not owe them fatherhood. Their parent (your ex) owes them parenthood. \n\n> nor do I want to be sued for child support someday if she were to change her mind and decide I owe her.\n\nThis one, unfortunately, I can't help you with. I can tell you that a lot of women don't go after child support in the first place and a lot of stories you hear are way overblown compared to what's common. If you do end up paying child support, it will be your only obligation and considering this would be your only one, unlikely to be debilitating. \n\n> My questions are: How can I convince her to get an abortion even though she wants to keep it?\n\nHonestly, you probably can't, and it wouldn't be ethical to continue trying to. She's dumped you and explicitly told you what she wants to do. \n\n> It would be such a relief for me if she\u2019d abort. I want nothing to do with the baby\n\nI understand that, but you don't get to decide what other people do with their body.

In April, I found a few positive pregnancy tests on her bathroom counter. I asked her about it (I\u2019m in my 40s and had never gotten a woman pregnant, so I was in shock) and that is how I found out. I told her I didn\u2019t want the baby and she told me she didn\u2019t expect anything from me and that I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about anything. She said she was ok with raising the baby on her own. However, she\u2019s in her mid 20s and I know she could eventually change her mind and come after me for child support. I was (and still am) terrified of being a dad. About 2 weeks later I went with her to her first ultrasound. She seemed happy enough but I was filled with dread. When we got home from the ultrasound, I gave her an ultimatum. Either have an abortion or we were over. So she told me she guessed we are over then and kicked me out of her apartment. So that is how we broke up. \n\nI hadn\u2019t seen her for a while until I went over to her place a few days ago. Mostly out of curiosity. I\u2019d been hoping she\u2019d either lost the baby or decided to abort. But no. She\u2019s got a bump and has a full on nursery ready for the baby. She\u2019s due in the middle of December. Not sure how far along she is exactly. She told me again that she doesn\u2019t expect anything from me and that she thinks the baby would be better off without me in its life. To be fair, she hasn\u2019t asked me for anything yet but I am scared she will change her mind after the baby is born. My number one biggest fear in life is fatherhood. I feel so trapped. I know in my heart I am just not cut out for it, nor do I want to be sued for child support someday if she were to change her mind and decide I owe her. And I know that would technically be completely within her rights. She is on food stamps as it is. I have heard horror stories about the state coming after dads for child support if the mom is on welfare. It doesn\u2019t even have to be the woman who sues. Not sure if that is entirely true or not but it terrifies me. \n\nMy questions are: How can I convince her to get an abortion even though she wants to keep it? It would be such a relief for me if she\u2019d abort. I want nothing to do with the baby. I am so stressed out I can barely function and I don\u2019t know what to do. My other question is this: Is there anywhere in the US that would do an abortion on her being somewhere in the 20 something weeks along? We live in Oklahoma, but I would be more than happy to drive her wherever we need to go (within the US) to get her an abortion.",

I'm sorry you're frustrated it sounds like you need to have a very serious talk with your partner and express your frustration. There is definitely no shame in getting another abortion. I would talk to your doctor about other possible forms of contraception as condoms/pulling out have a low effectiveness even though they're advertised otherwise. They're advertised as 99% effective however that's for 'perfect-use' and a large percentage of the population doesn't do 'perfect-use' (not enough lube, wrong size, didn't pull it all the way etc.) in actuality they're more like 89% effective. It's frustrating because I didn't know all this until I worked in a sexual health clinic and I was so annoyed that we didn't get better sex-ed! Anyway I hope your partner is understanding and supportive! It sure sounds like it's their turn to pull their weight when it comes to contraception.

I have a one year old and I KNOW that my fianc\u00e9 and I have way too many expenses to afford another baby. We\u2019re getting married, planned on a vacation and a honeymoon and a baby is just not in the cards. \n\nI\u2019m super early in my pregnancy, I actually came at 3 weeks LAST week to PP and they drew my blood to confirm my pregnancy since they couldn\u2019t see anything in my uterus. They called me the following day to confirm that I was almost four weeks and told me to come in **today** \n\nNow here I am, in the waiting room, fiance outside waiting on me. And I\u2019m scared shitless. I was raised prolife, although I\u2019ve ALWAYS been pro choice for other women, that\u2019s just how I was unfortunately raised. It was my mom and grandmother who always pushed these negative prolife views on me and now I feel like I\u2019m lying to my mother by not telling her what I\u2019m going through. I trust my mom, she\u2019s like my best friend and to not be able to tell her what\u2019s happening with me is breaking me down piece by piece. I don\u2019t want to break. I hate that she would look at me with unforgivable eyes for the rest of my life.  She\u2019s already somewhat disappointed that I\u2019m a stripper, although she got over it, my very conservative dad has not. He even missed my engagement party.\n\nGranted, I\u2019m lucky that I have my fianc\u00e9e and friends as support and thankful that I live in a state that is still pro abortion. I just needed to vent about how guilty I feel, even knowing that this THING inside me is only a clump of cells. \n\nI guess in reality I\u2019m just scared. Im scared that I\u2019ll be in pain. I mean I went through literal birth, ALMOST completely unmedicated. Yet - this still scares the shit out of me. I hope everything goes well. I hope you all are okay as well. I\u2019ll be walking the rally\u2019s for roe v wade this weekend if I\u2019m feeling better. I\u2019ll update you all on my experience if anyone wants it.",

If your decision is that you do not want to be pregnant right now, there are resources to help you. It would be helpful to know what state you're in to be more specific, but you can start by calling the National Abortion Federation's hotline at 1-800-772-9100. They can help. \n\nI know it's hard to go against the beliefs of your family and community, but this is your life and your future and not anyone else's. Do what is best for you. You deserve it.",

In my opinion, she shouldn't raise a child - I guess I am pro-choice because I do not think there is anything morally wrong with aborting a very early pregnancy, but I am not trying to \"force\" this agenda on her. In fact it isn't even an agenda - I just want to give her valid points about what raising a baby means. In my opinion, she is not financially responsible enough to raise a baby, and I wanted to convey that to her in a way that made sense with proper arguments.\n\n  As an update to this original thread - my girlfriend and this girl *lied* to me about the pregnancy. They wanted to \"play a joke\" on me. I almost left work because I was having a panic attack and needed medication. They ended up making up this elaborate lie that they took a second set and my GF's test came back negative but the other girl's was \"inconclusive\". At any rate, I got the other girl alone and told her that my GF said it was a prank, and she conceded that it was a lie (My girlfriend did not tell me). Even after I knew, I asked my girlfriend again. I asked her to look me right in the eye and swear to god that she wasn't lying, and she did. SHE STILL LIED RIGHT TO MY FACE! It was a very cruel joke (like I said, I nearly left work from a panic attack), and then she has the audacity to CONTINUE lying to me about it, even after I knew. Why the fuck did she do this to me? I guess another reason why immature people like this should not be raising children - imagine if their mothers raise them to be liars and play terrible jokes on people like this.

                          "body": "Okay so new things have come to light - let me go back and explain this story from the beginning so you can see what I am dealing with. The story I am telling you is 100% true without any embellishments.\n\n  I am at work and I get a video message of my girlfriend (we will call her C) and her friend (we will call her S), eating lunch with S's niece. C tells me that she thinks her niece is \"cute\" and that she wants one. I respond saying you can't buy those. She says, \"Well then lets make one\". I reply \"No, we are not anywhere near ready to bring a child into this world\". C responds, \"Well, too late\". I said \"What?!?\", and she responds, \"I am pregnant\". I could not believe it, so I asked her how she knew. She replied back that \"We took a test\" (meaning C and S took a pregnancy test together). At this point, she sends me a picture of a positive pregnancy test. Now, I start freaking out. My initial reaction is that they are fucking with me, so I do a reverse image search on the picture and no results come up. Now I am just thinking to myself \"Oh fuck.\". I start panicking. I ask them again if they are playing a prank on me, and C says no. Now I call S. I ask S \"What happened?\" and she tells me (I'm paraphrasing here) that both S and C took a pregnancy test, but they \"mixed them up\" and they aren't sure whose is whose (sidenote: How stupid can you be to mix up a pregnancy test?). Now, S tells me that she thinks it is hers, and it is not C's, like they originally told me. I tell S \"Go down to the store, get another test, I will pay for it, take it, and send me the picture of it later.\" She agrees. Instead of going to the store, they go to my house where I had an extra pregnancy test, C takes it, and then they send me the picture. It comes back negative, and I am relieved. At this point, I am having suspicions. How could you mix up a pregnancy test? What compelled her to take the test originally? Why would they both take a test? Why is S talking to me from her FB messenger AND from C's phone at the same time (apparently C was now in the shower). \n\n  At any rate, now C has to go to work. She is telling me all this stuff how she is panicking and doesn't know what to do. I offer her a valium (I had some at home and I was going to go home and take 1 - she doesn't accept) before she goes to work. I told her, \"S, I want to help you any way that you can. Call me when you get off work and I will come by and we can talk about the situation\" (This is when I posted the original thread, asking for help about what to say to her). During the rest of the day, C tells me that S took another test (very near impossible in the time frame from the second test to when S has work, so I was suspicious) and it came back negative. So, 10 O'Clock comes around and I go to pick her up, and C stays home (I have a small car). I am still very suspicious, so when I pick her up, I tell her that C told me everything was a prank. She seemed surprised that C would tell me that (which she didn't), and then she admits it was a prank. Then, I admit that C didn't tell me anything and that S just outed herself. I was furious. How could they lie to me like that, ALL DAY, while I am seriously risking my livelyhood to come home and take a valium in order to not have a heart attack? I asked them multiple times if they were fucking with me and I continually was met with the same response, \"No.\". So, when we get back to my place, C is in my room, and I start. I ask, \"So now that I have you both here, tell me what happened earlier with these tests?\". C proceeds to tell me the same story that I had been told earlier. \"Are you sure you were just fucking with me?\" and she responds \"No Chris, we weren't fucking with you, why would we do that?\". And I ask her, \"Look me right in the eyes, swear to god and say that again.\" - and she does. She looked square in the eyes and promised me that she wasn't lying..until S pipes up, \"Honesty is the best policy\". C looked at S with anger, because S had just put C on the spot. Now, she admits it, \"Fine, I was lying. I wanted to see how you would react.\" And then nothing, sits back in bed like nothing happened. Did not even say sorry, showed no remorse, did not even defend herself. I am still pissed off.\n\nJust one last note - she did something similar to me in CVS about a month ago. Said she was pregnant, not fucking with me, etc. I literally nearly fainted - my vision started to black out and I could not breath. I was having a full on panic induced hyperventilation and she finally admitted it was a joke. So she definitely knows how seriously I would take a pregnancy.\n\nSince this happened I have been trying to ignore the Lie and the whole situation in general, but I am pissed off. Seriously pissed off. Is my girlfriend and asshole? Am I reacting too harshly to this? I don't know what to do. I don't know how I can trust anything she says to me anymore after lying about this, straight to my face, and then having no remorse for the lie. ",

My girlfriend is not, but her friend is. I will be picking her friend up tonight and the three of us will talk. I am pro-choice and my girlfriend is not. I do not know where her friend stands.\n\n  What I do know is that I would not be able to raise a child and neither would my girlfriend, together or apart...not only because of the financial aspect of it, but she is 18 and immature. I am almost 26, I work in software and make good money and have a good head on my shoulders but I am still in debt and I do not have the wisdom or life experience to pass on to a child. But, back to her friend. I don't know how this is going to start but I am going to try to convince her to have an abortion. I do not think it is fair to the would-be child to carry on a pregnancy and deliver for the reasons I stated above. The girl is also only 18 - she is in community college and works at the mall. I honestly do not think she could raise a child simply because of the financial aspect - I do not know her well enough to form an opinion on her candidacy for motherhood. Regardless, we are going to have this conversation tonight. I want to know some things I could enlighten her about about the difficulty of raising a child. I also want to hear some arguments about why getting an early term abortion isn't all that \"immoral\". I know this last point is a huge topic of debate, so throw both arguments at me, but in my mind, a child is not a child at the point of conception - to me a child is a child when it develops a conscious. I don't know exactly when that is but to me it certainly isn't right now. An abortion on day 1 is the same as throwing away a condom to me.\n\n  Please, I need help. I want to guide this girl in the right direction and to me, it means getting an abortion for the reasons I said above. If you guys have any good things that you think would help both her and myself in making a decision (obviously, she is making the decision, I am just coming for support), it would be greatly appreciated. I just want to have things to say so that she considers the baby and not the \"moral dilemma\" of abortion. Like raising a child in poverty and still being a child yourself, etc. Please help.

You are allowed to change your mind and going through this is hard enough (emotionally and physically), so I\u2019m hoping my experience might be helpful for you.\n\nI had a medical scheduled and called and switched to surgical. I did not want to feel sick or drag on the bleeding and cramping\u2014 I figured that would just lead to more anxiety and I just wanted to be done with it. Depending on where you are, some private clinics allow sedation for a cost if you have a driver. I took the highest sedation offered and it was an all day thing (9-2/3) but I don\u2019t remember any of the actual procedure. Had a few hours of bleeding afterward and cramping for a few days, but mild. \n\nWould 100% choose surgical again. The women who were doing the medical seemed to be there prob 3-4 hours, rather than 6 or so that I was there. It was a hard day, but nothing could replace walking out and knowing it was fully behind me. I couldn\u2019t imagine going through it at home. For me it was very comforting to have the support of the nurses and doctors there during all of it. Especially if it has been a hard decision emotionally, the closure and finality is important as well. \n\nI hope this helps you make the decision that is right for you. Someone who had a medical abortion may have a very different experience than what I am imagining mine would have been. I think medical would be good if you are very anxious about being there the whole time, the medical setting, or maybe aren\u2019t feeling particularly emotional about the process. Surgical was right for me. Best of luck to you. It will all be over and behind you soon!",

Immediately all I could think was \u201cI can\u2019t do this right now\u201d. 3 weeks later this is still my thought. Physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, I just can\u2019t. I\u2019m sad about it, but I know this is for sure the right decision. My partner is 1000% supportive and just wants me to do whatever I feel I need to do and understands completely where I\u2019m coming from. I made my appointment for Nov 20, I\u2019ll be 9 weeks 1 day (wish they could have gotten me in sooner). I\u2019m scheduled for a medical abortion, but now I\u2019m wondering if I should call and see about switching to suction instead. I know the effectiveness goes down the further past 8 weeks you get, and I\u2019m terrified it won\u2019t work. My child also has an event on the 21st that I\u2019m worried about getting her too if I do the pill. I worry about the length of the appointment though if I do suction. Since it\u2019s a Saturday and the clinic is over an hour away it will be me, my partner, and our child. The two of them will go off to find something to do while I\u2019m in my appointment and then come back when I\u2019m done. I guess I\u2019m just looking for experiences with either option at 9 weeks. This is such a weird position for me to be in and I have no one to ask.",

Maybe you could expand on that. \nIf you're only atheist because your family is, then I would encourage you to look into theism for your self with a sober viewpoint like I and many others do. \nI think everyone can agree that Hitler did not act upon the true tenants of Christianity. A true follower of Christianity would not have done those things, and to say otherwise is to claim ignorance on the values and duties set into Christian theism. Someone claiming a religion doesn't necessarily make them a real follower.\nI too have doctors and lawyers and such in my family that aren't necessarily theists, but I don't think they've cared enough to actually look into the evidence for theism. I haven't always been a Christian, but I researched religions and came to the conclusion that its very likely that Jesus actually did what the Bible records him to have done. I think there is a lot of evidence for theism in general (especially Christianity and Judiasm) and it makes more sense of reality than atheism. While coming to these conclusions I didn't blindly accept anything without good evidence. \nMy question to you is Why should your guidelines for abortion (clearly different from the after-birth abortions article) be more correct or true than others? How can we know which one of the many guidelines is the best?",

That makes a lot of sense on an atheistic viewpoint, because humans are really no different from the rest of the animal kingdom and have no objective, real purpose and are not intrinsically valuable. Hitler was completely justified in slaughtering the Jews because he was acting according to natural selection. The only way you could say he was wrong is that he was just not following the evolutionary construct of morality, which isn't necessarily bad because he's not responsible to some higher power for behaving in a strange way.\nDogs do feel pain, and it probably feels the same to a human. That can be inferred from every day experience. Just because you haven't felt pain as a dog, doesn't mean they don't feel pain. Is your pain any less real because a dog hasn't felt human pain?\nThe fact is its not about inflicting pain on something. If you can kill someone painlessly, then pain is not a relevant issue in killing. It's about harming something which **can** cause pain but does not **always** cause pain.",

Why is it ethical to kill them for the same reasons we might have an abortion; overpopulation, genetic abnormalities, mental defects? (After all, anything that senses pain knows it's alive right?). Should we grant them the same rights as humans as suggested in this article?\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-17116882\n\n*I'm not listing qualities it must have to have the right to life. I'm saying why those qualities make not giving it the right to life unethical.*\nYou're listing qualities that a fetus does not have that make it morally permissible to kill it. If they possess them, then it's not morally permissible to kill it. \nYou said:\n\"a fetus with no sense of being and no thalmic brain connections which allow sensory input...It has not experienced the feeling of being alive, the knowledge that it exists, and you're not taking away anything from it\"\n**That's a list** and that is harm. \nPain has nothing to do with the morality of killing a fetus. You can give a lethal injection to an adult and it will feel no pain. Pain is just not relevant. You are, however, still harming them. You're defining harm as in the recipient feeling pain, but that's just not the definition of harm. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/harm\n\n\nThe reason I think killing a fetus is wrong IS because it is immoral. It is the taking of the life of an innocent person. In fact, if the fetus is not a human being, then neither I nor anyone else will care. Have all the abortions you want. Make it as safe as possible for women to have abortions, because then it becomes no different than an elective surgery to fix a body part. If it is a human life, then it's the same as taking the life of an innocent adult. This happens about 3,700 times a day in the US alone.  \n\n\n\n\n\n",

This happens partway through pregnancy. It is immoral to kill any innocent being that has had the pleasure of *knowing* it is alive. (Anything that senses pain knows it's alive)\n\nI'm **not** listing qualities it must have to have the right to life. I'm saying why those qualities make not giving it the right to life unethical. I'm not saying that anything that has no sense of being alive and cannot feel pain can be killed, I'm saying that you're twisting my words to mean things they do not mean, and have yet to provide a reason why killing a fetus that has nothing except potential is immoral.\n\nThat website seems to address what I said about being self-aware, but not the feeling of pain. A newborn senses pain, an 8 month fetus senses pain.\nA 2 month fetus does not have the capacity to sense pain.\n\nAgain, I'm not listing these qualities as reasons to choose when to give the right to life, I'm giving them as arguments that say taking away the right to life is something that harms them mentally in no way at all, including physical pain. Yes, it destroys them. But it harms no one, as harm is only existent when the recipient can sense it. \n",

I'm saying the mother should decide when the right to life is given. So there is *no finite black and white line* as to when that is. When she decides to keep the baby, it would be under full protection of the law. Maybe even having people have to fill out a form that they would have an abortion if they got pregnant beforehand would work. I want it to be legal for people who have had birth control fail, or were raped. If people are having unprotected sex then having an abortion, that's kind of redundant and \nharder for the mother. My point is that any early abortion is not harmful to the human fetus, and if a mother got pregnant by accident then giving her the right to determine if it has rights and lives or not is in no way similar to giving one person the power to determine who has rights. It's the pro-life side that is doing that, and saying it **definitively** begins at conception. ",

It is completely natural to have mixed feelings, just as it is completely natural to be certain the moment you look at the stick of what you want to do.  Whatever reaction you have is natural and normal, for you and your situation.\n\nIf you are very early along, you may have some time to think about your options.  And if you're conflicted, I would take the time you need to know for sure.  To perhaps talk to supportive people who *do* know your situation.  \n\nRemember that this is *your* body, so if you want the baby but the father doesn't want you to have it, it's still your call.  The only place that should have in your decision is knowing that if you choose to keep the child you may need to look to other supportive people in your life (and if a guy is isolating you to the point you don't have any, leaving him is a good idea regardless of what you decide about the pregnancy).\n\nKnow that you are not the only one who has been where you are, no matter what you decide.  And we will be here for you to support you whatever you do decide.\n\nBut we can't make that decision for you, hon.\n\nHuuuuuugs.....",

In September, I had spotting a day before I started my placebo pills. My placebo week in October had no spotting before my period (my periods were supposed to fall the 1st - 5th and then the 29th - 2nd). However, when it came to my next placebo week, I began spotting nearly a week before starting my pills, and then had my normally scheduled period. \n\nI have been sexually active since August and have decided to text monthly just in case. The last time I had sex was October 17th. We always use condoms, withdrawal, and this time there was spermicide in the condom, but I know nothing is ever 100%. That weird spotting began on October 23nd, not even a week after that, and I\u2019m afraid it was implantation bleeding as unlikely as it is. \n\nSo, twenty one days after sex I took a couple tests, both negative, and then a week after that I took another two, still negative. I felt pretty relaxed about it until I read that sometimes your body doesn\u2019t make enough HCG early on, and then I started getting nervous. I\u2019m not in a good spot to be pregnant, and I seriously never want children, so it\u2019s safe to say I\u2019m fairly stressed out. \n\nAm I overreacting about all of this or is there any possibility that I could be pregnant? I know it has to be extremely unlikely, but with all of the issues I have with my reproductive organs, I\u2019m afraid it could be a possibility that something went wrong and I am pregnant. \n\nIf I am pregnant, I don\u2019t know where I could go to get an abortion and I certainly don\u2019t know how I could keep it private or be able to afford it. I still live with my very pro-life family, and I don\u2019t know how I could get it past them. I\u2019ve heard of Aid Access, but I don\u2019t know if it would be smart to order pills even if a test was negative just in case, but I can\u2019t get to a doctor\u2019s office to have blood work done to be absolute certain of anything. \n\nHas anyone else been in this situation?

Young and adventurous I guess. Well I recently moved back home, and about 2 weeks ago I found out I was pregnant and immediately scheduled the abortion for 10 days. \n\nI thought it was my FWBS, he said if I wanted to keep it he would help me raise it and co-parent etc. we could even move in together, but at the same time he didn't feel like he was ready for a kid and would prefer I moved forward with the abortion. But ultimately he said he trusted me and knows that whatever decision I make it will be the right one. Just total support for whatever. Knowing I had a large network of support I went ahead with the procedure anyways, which I was fortunate enough to be able to do the pill abortion. \n\nWell at the appointment they have to do the ultra sound, turns out I was 8 weeks... not 6 weeks. That puts me getting pregnant in the state I had just escaped from. Not at all from my FWB  \n\nSee in the state I had lived in previously , I was completely isolated from friends and family and I was so miserable and depressed, I was drinking so much I blacked out atleast 3x a week. Mentally I was a fast and hard downward spiral just totally out of control. I definitely did some questionable activities which landed me with a parasite growing inside me. (I'm of the belief that if you don't want it, it's a parasite, can't change my mind) \n\nI can't help but feel like the abortion was the best thing I've ever done. It feels like all the sadness and pain from where I was, was contained inside that parasite sucking the life out of me and making me physically ill. All of the suffering expelled from my body. I feel like a whole new person, physically and mentally and tbh you can't pay me enough money to ever get pregnant again. I have been cleansed and I'm so so greatful",

        "body": "I had an abortion at 9 weeks. I don\u2019t know who the father would have been. I had sex with \u201cman A (23M)\u201d on July 25th, then, July 31st, had sex with \u201cman b (23M)\u201d. Both of these men were fwbs-nominal friendships, but the relationship with each was mainly based on sex. On the ultrasound, fhr estimated the date of conception was sometime that week, most likely around July 25th, but possibly July 31th. On July 25th, had sex with a condom on, but the condom ended up breaking, and July 31th, \u201cman b\u201d did not use a condom (man b wasn\u2019t able to stay hard). Was on birth control pill this whole time. I never told either man I was pregnant. I stopped seeing \u201cman A\u201d after July 25th. He entered a relationship. While I was pregnant during August, I kept In touch with man b, but never told him of pregnancy (told him I was going through some mental health stuff, technically true). I didn\u2019t want to tell either man because I was worried that they\u2019d try to influence my decision. I had the abortion in September. I didn\u2019t see \u201cman b\u201d again until November. I had sex with him 3 more times during the winter. This whole time I became increasingly infatuated with him while simultaneously facing remorse from abortion. I knew how messed up it was for me to continue seeing him. I felt resentful of him, remorseful for being so reckless during July, guilty for not telling him about pregnancy. I couldn\u2019t act normally around him anymore because of the  guilt  and ended up crying after the most recent sex because he claimed he \u201cforget a condom\u201d but insisted we\u2019d be fine. The same mentality that possibly led to the pregnancy. I told him I had feelings for him but didn\u2019t tell him about pregnancy. A week later, He told me that he wanted to stop seeing me. He said he could never see me as someone he would ever date, and that I shouldn\u2019t develop such serious feelings or get so attached.\n\nI feel so messed up for continuing to have sex with him. I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve even developed strong feelings for him if the pregnancy wouldn\u2019t have occurred. The emotions I felt towards him weren\u2019t about him but rather his role in everything. I don\u2019t know what I was expected to get out of continuing to see him. I don\u2019t know if it is even his but I feel so alone in what I went through while he doesn\u2019t even know about the events that colored my interactions with him. I had a breakdown yesterday after ending things. I think it\u2019s complex grief. I don\u2019t know if letting either of the men know about the pregnancy would help me move on. They aren\u2019t gonna offer any answers or help me feel resolved in my decision to abort. I am frustrated that these men get to go own their lives without facing any of the burden of knowing. But I also don\u2019t want to dump this on either of them if I don\u2019t know who would have been the father. I don\u2019t think it would be right to share that and possibly affect their lives, consciences, etc for something that I\u2019m not sure of. I don\u2019t know what to do so am looking for advice. \n\nTl: dr: deciding whether to tell possible fathers about abortion. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth sharing this pain and dragging them into it after the fact, it bothers me that they don\u2019t have to live with guilt",

        "body": "I wanted to share my story because I read a young girls experience and it helped me more than I could ever realize at the time. I had my abortion yesterday, however I chose the medical option which takes two days. My appointment at planned parenthood was on Friday morning. Some background info I am 18 HS student, didn't tell family, my BF is the father still with him,  never questioned decision once. Anyway everyone at the clinic was so nice, which made everything so much smoother just being nice to someone especially in a situation like that is just so comforting and helpful I hope every woman knows how important there job is in there and how thankful I am. Oh btw have a HUGE MEGA RIDICULOUS DEBILITATING anxiety towards needles and guess what they have to do a finger prick!!! As soon as I smell the rubbing alcohol I knew I had to get outside into fresh air. (For anyone who hasn't had a panic attack there is an overwhelming urge to be outside its like the only place you feel safe) this wasn't a full blown panic attack though just the physical effects vomiting/passing out. OK anyway here's the good part if you've never seen or been to an abortion clinic there's these evil sub-human monsters that troll the front of the building handing you disturbing pamphlets of information that's completely not true and telling you you're going to hell if you go through with this. So here I am projectile vomiting in the pouring rain when this gentle old man comes up to me patting my back and comforting me which was actually nice at the time and for one fleeting moment I thought *hey these are people too just really arrogant people, they still have a heart* \"Are you okay, you can come sit down, we'll take care of you\" *still vomiting* \"Do you know why this is happening? because god is punishing you for the sins you've committed! Have you ever received a sign? A sign you were doing something wrong?\" The anger that was building up inside of me was comparable to the mass quantities of vomit on the sidewalk. I finally turned my head to see the soft blue eyes my grandfather also had, which sickened me to think that my sweet papa and this lowlife had anything in common. I lost it. \"Have you ever been given a sign not to be such a fucking asshole everyday? guess not, huh! You are a sick depraved man who's going to hell just like me.\" He backed up in shock but then persisted \"You are clearly just in need of a..\" \"GET AWAY FROM ME!\" I finally stood up \"Get the fuck away from me now\"' My boyfriend finally came outside which I guess discouraged the man. But looking back at this whole experience the most grippng moment was looking at the man as he staggered away, he was so confused and hurt like someone just punched him in the stomach. How could this sick bastard that literally wakes up and ruins peoples day and makes young girls cry, how could he feel pain? It was like he went his whole long life and it never occurred to him that he could possibly be wrong about his hateful opposition. I was so relieved and liberated I went back inside, took the first pill which stops the pregnancy from progressing. Then I went to my boyfriends and slept, I hadn't really thought about the abortion at all which kind of bothered me. I knew extremely early that I was pregnant though and it came as no surprise, I had not lost a wink of sleep over this. I still always ask myself why? why do some people have so much trouble with this decision? Why had I not cried in solitude, why had I not questioned my morals? Why had I not weighed other options? This is a huge reason why I hadn't told my family. Sometimes and I don't exactly know why but people sometimes describe me as emotionally unavailable and cold. I hate this, I hate this so much I would never give them a legitimate reason to foster this idea about me any longer. The next day came and I decided to go home I figured the actual abortion would be messy and I've only been dating my boyfriend for 2 months so didn't feel comfortable with him scrubbing period blood and embryo matter out of his sheets. So finally took them and anti nausea medication and within a half hour my stomach was already beginning to cramp pretty badly. I'm sorry i'm telling you this I really am but no one told me these things and I was so scared so I want other girls to know what to expect. I puked everywhere I don't think this happens to everyone though I have a weak stomach. The pain got worse and worse I sat in an extremely hot bath to no avail its like when you're in that much pain you can feel nothing else and you can hardly think either. I don't know how but I got the strength up and layed in bed while my friends tried to joke and comfort me. I cried I was in so much pain. I really at one point almost wanted to die which sounds so crazy but it made me think of people who are in pain everyday and live like that and it was so discouraging. 2 hours later and it just stopped, it's the best you'll ever feel in your life and that's just because you're not doubled over in suicidal pain for one split second and you almost don't wanna move because you're scared you'll fuck something up. Upon further research I read that a lot of people say the pain ends in 2 hours wish I knew that then. Anyway I know this sounds insanely dramatic and a lot of people don't have this same experience but I just wanted to share because I want you to know that the pain does end and you can get through it. I know it sounds cliche but I do feel like a stronger person because of it. So I eventually moved from the curled up ball I've been in for the past 2 hours and it happens. I was wearing shorts too which added to the effect, okay so I stand up and all these things plop out of me like gushy little frog under bellies. There was about four of them they were less than a centimeter thick but they were about the size of an egg. Which my dog immediately inspected and licked. I had minor cramping after that but I am just so happy it's over with. Please learn from my terrible mistake do NOT get pregnant its sooooo not worth it. Anyway thank you for listening .",

She told her fianc\u00e9 at the time who told my grandma, who then told my parents. My whole family is religious and pro-life so of course they thought I should keep the baby. It didn\u2019t matter what I wanted. I said I didn\u2019t want to have it so they said I could have it and then they would raise it. I cried every night of my pregnancy, wishing it would die. I had to be induced and everything was pretty traumatic.\n\nI gave birth to my first son. I suffered from depression. My mom took over raising him until I was able to cope with what my life had become and we moved out into our own apartment. Things were starting to get better and we started bonding more. I lost a bunch of weight and started feeling good about myself again. I was out with friends every weekend. Life was going pretty good until I got pregnant again, from a one night stand.\n\nI was excited about having another baby, my son was excited about being a big brother. I told my family that I was doing it alone again but I was happy. I miscarried a few weeks later. I started going out again because being drunk felt better than being sad. No surprise I got pregnant again, but the guy was still married to one of my coworkers.\n\nI wasn\u2019t happy about having another baby this time, and dealt with more emotional abuse from the father. I told my cousin I didn\u2019t want to keep it but soon learned that she was very pro-life and told our entire family. I felt like trash but that all changed when I found out the baby was a girl! I had always wanted a girl, but I honestly wasn\u2019t sure if the guy I thought was the father actually was. Ancestry DNA has since linked my daughter to her fathers mother since he would not take a DNA test so all is well there. He still sucks but his mom and I have a wonderful relationship.\n\nAfter getting my heart broken again I started talking to my ex\u2019s friend to try to make him jealous, but he never cared about me so that didn\u2019t matter. We had a one night stand, the literal only time in that particular cycle, and I got pregnant with my youngest. I couldn\u2019t justify getting an abortion because I didn\u2019t see a difference between that one and my other two children. His birth was the easiest and I was finally able to experience a natural birth without pain meds. We bonded right from the beginning and I was able to take more time off work during his first few months. I finally moved his crib out of my room since he sleeps through the night. I\u2019ve started getting rid of all my old baby furniture and clothes. I was done with babies and had thought about getting my tubes tied but didn\u2019t want to take away the possibility of having another baby if by chance I actually met someone decent and wanted more.\n\nI found out on Wednesday that I\u2019m pregnant and it could honestly be one of two guys. I wouldn\u2019t mind it being the guy I work with. I\u2019ve liked him for too long but he seems to only like me when he\u2019s drunk. I have a feeling it\u2019s the other guys, and he literally moved away the next day. I can\u2019t do this again. I\u2019m already nauseous and tired and just want this over. I have a friend who will watch my youngest on Monday afternoon so I can go to Planned Parenthood to have this take care of. I haven\u2019t even cried. I\u2019m not upset at all over my decision. I don\u2019t feel anything for this thing. I have not told any family. They can\u2019t guilt trip me into having it. They won\u2019t tell me how stupid I am for getting pregnant for the fifth time. They never have to know.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to write so much, but I really wanted to share my whole story.",

Our birth control failed and we both weren\u2019t ready. I thought I was ready to have kids  summer 2019 and got pregnant in late August.  I realized my mistake as soon as the second line appeared and ultimately decided to get an abortion (which I thought my husband was supportive of but now that I\u2019m in a similar situation, he says he was not so much okay with it).\n\nThen in March 2020 and I got COVID and stopped taking my birth control pills because I was so sick. After I got better, my husband suggested I don\u2019t go back on them so I didn\u2019t. This quarantine has not been easy mentally and I thought it would be a good idea to start a family. Nearly immediately after I ovulated, I realized I made a huge mistake. Two weeks later, I found out I was pregnant. I\u2019m still not ready for kids and starting a family when you\u2019re not mentally 100% (depression, anxiety) is definitely a dumb idea.\n\nBut my husband thinks we\u2019re ready. He thinks now is the perfect time to start our family and asks how he can trust that I want to have a family with him when I keep wanting to delay when it does happen (which is valid). I tell him that I do want kids with him just not at this moment but he doesn\u2019t trust me. \n\nI know I\u2019m an awful person for intentionally getting pregnant and then regretting it. But I also feel completely and totally not ready for this huge life change.

        "body": "Got post-pregnancy boobs after an abortion (16 weeks) at 29. The guy was an ex of 7 years. We had broken up and I was off birth control at the time. My breasts were a 34D pre pregnancy. They grew to a 36F fairly quickly and then shrunk back post some complications leaving behind loose skin and a flat, deflated appearance. Its been 3 years now and it has impacted my self confidence hugely. New dates/sexual partners in the interim have been curious/concerned. One was downright offensive. Im 32 and afraid this is hurting my chances of getting a long term partner not least because of my own reluctance at this point, to put myself out there again. \n\nHow have others on the forum dealt with this issue? I have my qualms about going under the blade for this. To be honest I regret not raising the kid; albeit alone, more at this point. But the failure of a long term relationship and a low paying stressful job contributed to the choice I did make. I need to turn the page and believe that I will be loved and happy again but my body has turned into a constant reminder of this long past trauma. I eat well, exercise everyday, try to maintain a positive attitude but it has had no discernible impact. My ob-gyn recommended regular screenings for breast cancer but encourages me to accept what it is and move on with my life.\n\n--------------\n\nEDIT: \nA part of me wants to hate men who do not want to be with me for this reason. A part of me wants to be accepted as I am and move on to working on the other stuff that goes into a relationship. But who am I to judge? People want what they want and its better that they are honest about not finding me attractive right away so I dont have to deal with their indifference or cheating later on.\n\nIronically enough my breasts used to be my best feature. Noone told me this could happen. I was not prepared to be scarred in this manner. We dont talk enough about the toll pregnancy takes on women's bodies, most of it irreversible except through surgery.\n\nApologies for rambling on and on but its been one of those long nights of soul searching and really needed some catharsis right now.\n---------------\nTLDR: Pregnancy caused flat, deflated boobs regardless of abortion. Major self esteem issues being faced since then.\n\nI understand that nothing said on this forum constitutes medical advice.",

The people signing them in place are the same who make sure the common folk have less access to health care, remain stranded in poverty, get screwed over by big companies (including life balancing ones like big pharma), watch as the public education crumbles, and have whatever bit of government aid stripped away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese laws are about increasing control over women.\n\nWomen create lives, do most of the child rearing, and tend to be the ones who uphold traditions in their families the most, and do most of the elderly care. Most child centered jobs are upheld by women. Its easier to try to control a group of people than it is to try to control everyone. If you control most of the women, you eventually end up gaining control of the whole population, as women will be doing most of the rearing of the next generation. This is why religions have historically placed most of its focus on targeting women, from the way they dress to the frequency of them getting pregnant. The more educated and free a country allows its women to be, the lower the birth rates and the more ''demanding'' they are when it comes to the quality of health care and education their family get.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother reason for the attack on abortion rights is because it is an indirect way of attacking Planned Parenthood. There are many very wealthy and powerful people who will save A LOT of money if Planned Parenthood were to go away, so financing people to rise against it is basically a form of investment for them.Its hard to get people to fight against a clinic which offers all sorts of needed health services, so the focus is placed on them performing abortions while abortion is completely demonized. Its actually a quite commonly used, and effective, tactic for wealthy individuals and corporations to fund misinformation which leads the population to go against their own interest. Planned Parenthood is presented as ONLY a provider of abortions and slutty contraceptives, while every other service it provides is brushed under the rug and never spoken of. People then rise and fight against Planned Parenthood, and the government is only too happy to de-fund the healthcare provider and to go with the ''abortion is murder and they are performing abortions so we MUST de-fund them'' excuse. People don't realize that they are basically shooting themselves in both feet by aiding the decline of PP, whose abortion services are only a TINY percentage of all the needed and useful health services they provide to people who are not politician billionaires who can afford expensive private care.",

I feel so horrible for people in other states who no longer have access to basic health care. Truthfully for me, the overturn had the opposite effect that most anti-abortionists wanted it to have. It just gave me another reason to get the procedure done. I was only 7w along, but what if I was carrying a girl? How could I knowingly bring a daughter in to this world knowing there's a good chance when she is of age she will not be able to have basic human rights and access to reasonable health care? It's too scary to think about bringing my child in to this world, with how messed up it is. We are back peddling as a country. Inflation is insane. World conflict, global warming. \n\nMy child would have been born in 2023. If my child lived to be 80 they would live to see the year 2100. This world is so screwed up and hard to navigate now, what will things look like by then? What kind of world would my child's generation be left with? These were all things I considered when deciding to either continue my pregnancy or terminate. I agonized over it for a long while. Leading up to my appointment down to the very last minute I had mixed feelings and felt very unsure about my decision.

And with time, something that has one use, can develop more uses, or lose its original use and still have other uses. \n\nSex can be for procreation, and for bonding, or something else. And a clear example of where sex can't be directly involved with procreation, is in homosexual interactions. Evolution allows for homosexuality to exist and not be wiped out over the generations, so it seems to serve humanity just fine. But it could still be said to be about procreation. E.g. maybe it's good for a tribe not to have all the males fighting each other over the females. And meanwhile, the various members of the tribe can care for others without them being their direct descendents. The tribe could be healthier with some homosexuality, and overall it's part in allowing for the continued existence of the tribe. That's why I said food is about reproduction. Everything that promotes our enduring ability to reproduce, is about reproduction.\n\nObviously sex is a necessary step in reproduction (outside of medical science), but I think it's a mistake to focus on sex as being primarily about reproduction, as if it can't have any other sole purpose. For many people, reproduction acts as a deterrent, and stands as an unwanted byproduct of what their real purpose with sex is.",

It's weird seeing another person's bump and imagining what I would've looked and felt like now (I've never been pregnant except for this MA).

But my husband still doesn't want children and I don't know how he will react. He's fighting depression and it was not easy over the last months. I wouldn't be angry if he left... It's my decision, I can't decide for him. And I can't explain it to him..... But I can't even imagine to abort that possible child. I don't get why it's so... Different this timejj. And I don't get why I don't regret the first abortion and why I'm convinced it was the right thing to do for me,while now it's the opposite...\n\nHas anyone here maybe experienced the same? Or has some nice words? Anything?",

So it sounds like you were almost 'testing' yourself, if that makes sense. Well congratulations! You can get pregnant. \n\nSince you asked for opinions I will say, although the guy was reckless, it sounds like he really doesn't want this kid and if you go ahead you will be dealing with this bad dynamic and this situation for the rest of your life, not to mention bringing a child into the world who may very well be rejected by his or her father. Also there are two other kids who are going to be faced with a new half sibling. Sounds like a whole load of drama to me.\n\nOP, being a single mother is really, really tough, and you miss out on so much of the everyday things, sharing the difficult parts but also having someone who loves and worships that little person as much as you do. But there are legitimate reasons to do it, and then it's worth it. If you really want a baby and you haven't met the right partner then go for it as a single mother, going into it with open eyes about what you're getting into and a sperm donor or someone who actually signed up for it. It will feel a whole lot better than trapping some poor dude and will be a lot easier to explain to your offspring at a later date. \n\nAlso, please stop panicking about having a baby. You're young, there is plenty of time and there are other, better options than the one you're currently facing. I wish you all the best with whatever you decide to do.",

Why do you want to have the child of a man who wants nothing to do with it?\n\n________________________________\n\nEDIT: I also don't get the \"he should have been more careful\" thing. So you guys are all saying that he deserves this child as a \"punishment\" for being lax? That's terrible and there's no way that child won't feel that resentment.\n\nThis isn't \"largely your fault\". It's entirely your fault. He should have worn a condom but he was under the impression that you were on the pill. The only responsibility he has on his shoulders that he missed is that he didn't force you to take the pills in front of him. You allowed sex to continue without a condom knowing you weren't protected by your pills, and you purposefully neglected to share that information. I mean you were actively trying for a baby the moment you didn't take plan B after unprotected sex, and you tried without ever having an adult conversation with this man. That has to be terrifying for him.\n\n\nAll of that being said, I hope you're doing okay. I know this is an extremely rough time for you, and it's a difficult burden to bear. Whatever decision you make, there are resources out there to ease the cost and mental load. Good luck.",

In my opinion, you shouldn\u2019t dwell on how it happened but plan on how to make a mature and responsible future for the child it seems you very clearly want to keep. Of course as many have said, you will be tied to this person forever even if that means in dealing with his absence from your and your child\u2019s life.

I\u2019m obviously happy his mom chose to have him! And he has had a perfectly happy and fulfilling life. So all this stuff people are saying about your child (and you) having a bad life because of an absent father or difficult relationship with him is just nonsense. Lives take on all different shapes and forms and things are usually complicated even when we plan for the best. \n\nDo what you want to do!

But in August 2 times we had sex at a time I could of (obviously) gotten pregnant and I did not take plan b. Now I am pregnant. He wants me to get an abortion.

This sub Reddit has been a blessing in helping me deal with my emotions and my story. \n\nI was on the pill (cerelle, a mini pill, so no breaks) when I fell pregnant. I had been good at taking it and I can only think of a time when I was sick which may have caused my contraception to fail. \n\nBecause you don\u2019t take breaks on microgynon I did not realise I was pregnant until 17 weeks! I had no symptoms, I was not showing and the only reason I took the test was because I has some lower back pain developing and just wanted to be sure.\n\nI can\u2019t explain how scared I was when I got the positive result. I didn\u2019t sleep that night and I catastrophied the whole situation. My boyfriend knew something was up and I finally blurted it out to him.\n\nI am fortunate that I live in England and have a lot of options freely available to me. Within a week of my positive test I was at the clinic having my procedure. \n\nI initially went to an early pregnancy clinic where the midwife checked how far along she thought I was. I was absolutely, earth shatteringly, shocked to find out I was measuring at 17 weeks! This meant my only option going forwards was a surgical procedure under general anaesthetic during a global pandemic. \n\nRoll on 5 days and my procedure day came. I was terrified! It was a long day but I was prepared for this with a book, charger and cosy dressing gown. I was checked in and then talked to a nurse to confirm I was happy with the procedure. I then had dilation rods inserted and and IV put in. This was uncomfortable and I had some cramping for the rest of the day. As the nurses knew my procedure was later on they let me have some small snacks and drinks. They also gave me some pain killers for the cramps. I was terrified to be put to sleep but the anaesthetist was very kind. I felt very dizzy when he put the drugs into my IV and then the next thing I knew, I was waking up with the kindest nurse by my side. \n\nIn recovery I has some snack and drinks before telling the nurse how much I was bleeding. I only had some mild spotting. She confirmed the procedure had been successful including the insertion of an IUD (I don\u2019t trust the pill anymore) \n\nRecovery wise I was very lethargic for a day. One thing I wasn\u2019t expecting was that my milk came in. This was so so upsetting for me as I was also very emotional generally. I wore very low support sports bras, baggy T-shirt\u2019s and tucked frozen face pads into my bra. This went after about a week. \n\nI hope this story is somewhat helpful to some of you girls. Now I have been through it, I really feel the surgical procedure seems a lot easier and the pills. I do still feed sad sometimes for what might have been but I know it was the right decision for us at the time.",

I have no doubts. \nI have never seen children in my future, I don't believe I have the means to provide a child with a life they deserve and I am saddened by the world we live in today, I would feel cruel bringing an infant into a world so harsh and competitive with very little freedom and fear and pressure from every angle. I like my alone time and my freedom, I feel I am too selfish to be a parent happily. I am aiming high in my career at the moment and I don't want to put that in hold any longer. There are elements to my childhood that have solidified  my feelings of not wanting to be a parent in the future and falling pregnant hasn't changed that for me. \nWe have had long, emotional conversations about our feelings, and we both agree that we can't be the parents this baby deserves despite both feeling attached to the fetus inside me. \n\nWe are still certain we are making the right decision. \n\nAs a person who suffers with an irregular  cycle I was testing daily from my missed period to be certain i was not pregnant, it has been a fear of mine as I am honestly quite scared of abortions (but fully support them and feel relieved and grateful to not experience fear or hate for needing to undergo this process) \nMy partner and I both work for the NHS and have seen everything and anything that can go wrong, it sticks with you.. \nI unfortunately tested positive very late into my pregnancy and by the time there was an available slot for a telephone conversation to initiate treatment I am coming up to 9 weeks pregnant. (10 weeks being the UK cut off age for MA) \n\nDue to my medical hx and gestation I have been booked for a scan on Monday to confirm I am definitely under 10 weeks and that everything is okay to go ahead with a MA, should this not be the case or if anything is not right it will be a SA. \n\nMy partner and I have discussed the scan (he has to sit outside in the car, UK covid rules) \nBut I am thinking of asking for a picture of our ultrasound as I believe it will help us grieve.\nMy partner fully agreed once I explained why I feel it will help me and us move forwards in the future. \nIt makes it all real and I feel it gives us closure, I know for my own mental health if I don't see what has been causing me all these symptoms, caused us all this emotional pain and confusion that I won't fully process it and I don't want to ignore the fact that we made a baby, and despite it not being the right time it is still beautiful and a major part of our lives now. \nMy partner fully agrees but I feel like I need validation from other mothers, females, women who have had abortions/terminations and never gone on to have any other children. \n\nIt feels wrong to ignore the baby was ever there, despite knowing we are not taking it any further. \n\nAm I completely insane? \n\nThank you for reading this far if you have, any advice would be appreciated. \nLove to all you wonderful women out there supporting others through this traumatic experience. \u2764\ufe0f",

        "body": " \n\nOn June 16, 2016 a decision was made the profoundly affected my life. On March 25th of that year I found out that my boyfriend and I were pregnant. He vehemently chose to harass me about my choice to keep my daughter.\n\nLet's put all of this into a little bit more of a context. I lived in Hong Kong from August of 2012 until Sept of 2019. During this time I received my Hong Kong Permanent Residency card, like a Hong Kong Green card. In those seven years, most of the drama happened in 2016.\n\nMy job at the time was working in an English tutorial centre for kids and young adults. I was very happy there and making a pretty good income. Well enough that I was also able to attend Master's classes at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\n\nAfter I found out that I was pregnant the first thing I did was tell my boss, even before my boyfriend. As per Hong Kong law you should inform your employer as soon as you have medical confirmation of being pregnant.\n\nWhen my boss found out, the first thing she said was, \"Well you know I can't give you maternity leave.\" This statement in it of itself is illegal as in the Labour Law in Hong Kong all employees on continuous contracts are eligible for 10 weeks of maternity leave. She then proceeded to ask me when I was going to get it taken care of. When I told her I was planning to keep my child, she furiously said that the centre couldn't afford the bad reception from parents if they were to find out I was unmarried and pregnant. She didn't outright threaten to fire me if I didn't abort, but the intention was loud and clear.\n\nI then informed my boyfriend who was quite a bit younger than me at the time. He started off with well you know if you have this baby I wouldn't be able to stay with you right? After that I finally sat down with my student advisor at HKPU. She told me I wouldn't be able to stay in their programme if I was pregnant and that my studies would suffer if I kept my child.\n\nFast forward about 16 weeks and I am sitting in a public hospital in Hong Kong staring at my daughter on an ultrasound machine. I was completely numb. I checked in at 7:15 in the morning and was taken to a big ward. My bed was at the corner by the window, there were 10 beds in the room. I could see the ocean outside.\n\nAt about 11:00 a doctor came by and asked my several questions, in Hong Kong the abortion has to be certified as necessary by two separate doctors. There were two pills placed to soften the cervix and I was told to take another pill by mouth before the operation.\n\nAt 2:00 pm I was wheeled down to the operating theatre and I was injected with two different painkillers, funny how they didn't work at all. The pain was excruciating. I could feel the scraping.\n\nI was returned to my bed by the window after the operation and was given sleeping medication. Also, my temperature was checked every half hour and I was connected to a monitoring machine for vitals.\n\nThe surgeons who preformed the D&C were trainee doctors as this specific hospital was a teaching hospital. After I was discharged I was sent to a hotel nearby to recover. I received a phone call from my boss later that night at about 10pm telling me I was due back for work the next afternoon by 1:00.\n\nSo, I went back to work and tried to forget everything. That did not work and now 4 years later I suffer from extreme anxiety, depression and unstable moods.\n\nThe worst part about all of this is I was actually, in the end, fired from that job; about 1 year and 8 months after the abortion. Her final words to me were, \"You've know this was coming for a long time.\"\n\nI wish I could tell you things got better but in the following 4 years I have tried to kill myself at least 3 times.\n\nSo, my question to you is this, was my boss the asshole or was I , for not being strong. I wish every day I had a chance to meet my daughter, but for me the only memory of her that I have is that little ultrasound picture the morning of my abortion. Sometimes I don't know how to thing of this. My current boyfriend knows everything and is very kind and supportive. I don't know how to deal with the fact that I chose my job, relationship and schooling over my daughter.",

(I was so anxious the entire time the nurse took my blood pressure twice!!) \nUltrasound showed I\u2019m 5w5d along with only the most sore breasts in my life and occasional upset stomach/burping as pregnancy symptoms. \n\nTook the mife around 11 AM and to be honest I felt pretty normal except for a slight bit of nausea and light-headedness which seems to have passed around 3pm this afternoon. The clinic gave me zofran which I took around 12:30 that helped a bit (I just wish I took this BEFORE the mife ), but I\u2019m hoping for it to really pull through when I take it again before the miso. \n\nI have a few questions: I read the packaging for the miso I was given (4 200mg) that read Cytotec. Is miso the generic term for Cytotec? Trying to find something online but I keep finding myself down the rabbit hole. If they are the same thing, here\u2019s my next question\u2b07\ufe0f\n\nThe clinic advised I should take the miso in 24 hours buccally. However, reading from all of you lovely people in this sub, I really do not want to take these buccally which I know can cause even more nausea/vomiting.  I plan on taking these vaginally but I am curious if I need to wait the 24 hours. Since I took the mife around 11 Am can I take the miso at 5pm? Is 6-24 hours too early? \n\nI appreciate all of you so much! Any advice, suggestions are super appreciated. TIA",

Fast forward to February and about 3 months pregnant. Him and I break up.. He was a very conceded, arrogant and grew up with a silver spoon. We were very different and I couldn't handle it anymore. So where I am with one child from a name in a different state and pregnant by my ex. What was I going to do? I thought and thought about it. I finally looked up having an abortion and told only my mother and step mother. But by the time I had made my decision to have an abortion I was too far along for the state I live in to perform it. I had to have my step mom take me out of state and sit in a planned parenthood for several hours while I went through all the testing. \n\nThe first day they did blood and paper work. They did an ultrasound and asked if I wanted to see the baby. I told myself I wouldn't look if they asked me. But I did it anyways. I looked and say a little head, nose, mouth and hands. It was like looking at the first ultrasound of my daughter. So adorable and innocent. But I knew what was about to happen to it, or so I thought.  I thought they would put me to sleep, go in and take care of business, but that's not how it happened at all. \n\nFor people who are as far along as I was the process is much more intense. No \"take this pill come back tomorrow and you're done\". The first day they have to put several seaweed rods in your cervix to help open it and soak up some of the fluid. It was so painful and uncomfortable. That night I tossed and turned trying to get some sleep. But how could I with these rods inside me and with knowing what the next day would hold. \n\nOne the second day of my procedure I walked in thinking they were going to put me to sleep or and least numb me or something. They did me something they said would help me sleep or at least feel groggy or not remember what happened. Well they lied. I felt ever single thing! I felt the tools go inside me, the tug of them pulling things off my insides I could feel them taking my baby out of me. And even though I was in the most pain of my life, all I could think about was how much pain my unborn child was going through due to my mistake. I couldn't stop crying. \n\nWhen they were done they put in the nexplanon birth control in my arm and wheeled me into a room with about 4 other women. As I entered the room and looked around best I could through the tears, I noticed I wasn't the only one crying. They had put me in a room with other women who had gone through what I did. I stayed in this room for about 45 minutes just crying and trying to wrap my head around what I had just done. \n\nThe look from my step mom when I walked in the waiting hurt just as much. She saw my at my lowest point in my how life and I could just see the how hurt she was too. I cried for weeks without anyone knowing. I think about my unborn child every day. I beat myself up over it all the time. \n\nBut what I'm struggling with now is how do I raise my 3 year old daughter? How can you parent a child after ending a child's life before it begins?

So if there is anyone else here like me, whose dysphoria has been triggered again and again in trying to research ways to care for their body, I want you to know that you are valid. We are valid. Men CAN get pregnant, and it doesn't make you any less of the person you know yourself to be. This is a very emotional process, and it sucks for transmen to constantly be excluded (and effectively erased) in medical language.\n\nETA: Lurking a sub called r/seahorse_dads really helped me to feel better about my experience, in spite of making the decision to terminate my pregnancy, so I'm giving it a shout out in case it could help anyone else. A lot of great, trans dads-to-be there.",

        "body": "I thought while the experience is still fresh in my mind I'll write about it. It feels therapeutic to talk about it and recently I've lost most of my friends... And the ones I have left, have either moved away or would judge me. I'm writing this... in hopes that I'll help someone else out there in my position. I'd like to state that I am over 18 and out of school. But I do still live with my family at the moment because they want me to save up as much money as I can with my salary before I move out.\n\nSo my story starts a few months back. My boyfriend and I had been using the symptothermal method. Also known as natural family planning but a little more.... safe. I still stand by its effectiveness... If done correctly. for 3 years I could predict exactly when I ovulated. I knew it was exact because I could always say my period would start -date- and it would. although the bad thing about it is you HAVE to avoid sex between your period and until you ovulate. No sex even when you're period, because you can ovulate early. But after you ovulate you're free to go. Like I did... for two years my boyfriend and I had unprotected sex, not even pull out. and it worked. Until January this year when... My period came we took a big risk. I have a longer cycle so I thought... hey I only ovulate 17 days after my period usually sometimes even later... so I might as well just go for it... We did... and... I ovulated early. The sperm was still there and...\n\nA week before my period was supposed to come I remember feeling butterflies in my stomach... Just randomly. I guess that was my first symptom. I had just started my very first job as well... Well... then the day my period was supposed to come and it just didn't come. Nothing. My boyfriend told me not to worry. But I'm a very neurotic person. it was impossible... another week goes by... And my friend buys me a pregnancy test. And of course it was positive. 5 weeks pregnant. What now? I didn't even know what to do at that point. We live in a small town, the closest abortion clinic was 2 hours away and state hospitals... you hear horror stories about how they treat their patients for abortions. Plus just starting a job I didn't want to take a whole day of leave to go stand in the insanely long queues. Even when you're there at 6am it's insanely long. So I did something I'm not proud of... Went for a back street abortion. I received 4 Misoprostol Pills and looking back, that should've been my first warning sign. I bled a lot, passed clots, big ones. I thought It was successful, but my pregnancy symptoms persisted. Should've been another first warning sign.\nI reached out online after two weeks for advice. Someone told me to go to a pregnancy crisis center. They offer free ultrasounds and tests. I didn't have a lot of money so I went for it. The lady was very helpful I guess... But it was a front. Anyways so at 9 weeks pregnant I went to her. Immediately she told me she didn't want to influence my decision at all and was just here to talk to. This was a lie. She told me abortion increases your chance of breast cancer. This has never been proven and is a lie. She showed me an actual toy baby of how big my baby would be. She made me hold it. She gave me pamphlets about how bad abortion was. She told me that it's my decision though... And she didn't want to influence it at all. But she obviously was. You'd have to have been there as well to understand how much she tried. When the ultrasound started she had realised my mind was set and if there was still a baby that I'd go get an abortion, a proper one. So she didn't do the ultrasound properly, I know this because I researched and the way she did it... you wouldn't have seen anything. I didn't even have a full bladder, she told me to empty my bladder before the ultrasound. I didn't know any better until later. So I thought, nothing on my ultrasound... no baby. I'm not pregnant. But when I became 11 weeks pregnant there was a hard lump in my stomach... really hard.... the lady had been ignoring me though since the ultrasound even though she said she would get in contact with me the next day. at 12 weeks she contacted me, at exactly 12 weeks (she knew my dates). This is significant because in my country at 12 weeks the state stops offering abortions and only one private abortion clinic still offers it (they only have 14 centers across the country). The one 2 hours away. she asked me to come in for another ultrasound and sure enough there was the baby. It moved... This really got to me. I didn't like to see it move... I saw the heartbeat. She made me watch all of this... showed all of it to me, described it in detail. I asked her to stop once but she didn't.\n\nI went home in tears. My boyfriend was also in shock. We didn't know what to do... at all. I couldn't tell my family. They would kick me out. His mom would never have taken us because she's pro life. I couldn't tell any adult because it's a small town and news would travel. So I was left with taxis. In my country taxis are not quite as easily available to certain people. It's harder... and more expensive. I organised a shuttle bus though that would take us there and back. I called the clinic and booked an appointment for a 15 week abortion. However I needed a doctor to perform the surgery and the doctor only came in twice a month... So there was only one day that I could still get the abortion. I made plans though. The 2 weeks went by so slowly. I also had to rearrange another private taxi which cost 10 times as much as the petrol cost was... The money I had to spend to do this was just piling up for me... more and more. I went to change my bank withdrawal limit.. and then took out the huge amount of money I needed... I felt like such a target walking around with so much money. But I kept telling myself that they didn't know I had so much money on me.\n\nThe week and half leading up to it was a horrible time for our relationship. The stress made us argue a lot. We fought over what our options were constantly... But We just stayed strong knowing that all this will be over soon and we're just stressed. He really was amazingly supportive to me.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had to slip out of the house at 5:30am (it was still pitch black and there were no streetlights so we had to use torches) And walk to where we would be picked up... a 20 minute walk. When we got to the car I felt so relieved. The most dangerous part was over. And now we will get to the place.\n\nThe drive there was... peaceful. We talked the whole way and we even got \"road trip snacks\" to make it seem like more of a day... Thinking back on it the whole day is a blur.\n\nWhen we got there... and we had trouble finding the place as it was on the fourth floor of a shopping center and the sign was washed out... not what I was expecting for such an expensive treatment. We were the first there.\n\nThey asked me some questions at first and then sent me to a waiting room where 2 other girls (patients as well) were, the one was talkative the other quiet. When it was my turn I got called into the ultrasound room. The lady was so gentle with me and asked me whether I wanted to see it or not. I did... She told me how old it was, 15 weeks and 3 days. She told me the price and to go to the front office to pay. At the office the talkative lady started talking to me... And telling me about how bad abortion was. She was there to just get an ultrasound of her baby. The clinic also did normal pregnancy care... They should separate the girls rather... Some other girls may have been more vulnerable. But I didn't pay attention to the lady I just went to pay.\n\nAfter I paid I was taken to a counseling room where they asked me more in detail questions and then gave me 3 misoprostol pills to dilate my cervix over the next 3 hours. 2 under my tongue and the other in my Vagina. I wanted to put it in myself but she told me she had to... So here it came... The first time someone I didn't know or didn't love... Was going to put their hand up inside me... it was a shock... But I quickly got over it... It didn't feel like anything... Just as if I was putting a tampon in. A strange unknown object.\n\nI was then taken to a waiting room where there were two girls again.. The quiet girl from before and another new girl... This was the abortion waiting room... we started talking to each other and watched as more girls came in. The three of use were the only 3 who were 15 - 16 weeks along so we had to wait till every other girl was done even though we were the first there... It was because the cervix needed more time to dilate before the procedure can begin.\n\nThe girls who weren't as far along all looked really nervous. We watched them go into the procedure room and when they came out they were either smiling or in tears... There were so many of them.\n\nAn hour after I had taken the misoprostol the cramps began. and the shivers. You get so cold when you take these pills. Most girls do. It's a strange cold though... You don't feel cold but you can't stop shivering. I felt like I was going to die. It was so much worse than the last time I had taken Misoprostol. But... I could handle it. The other girls weren't in as much pain as I was. They had some normal cramps... I must've been unlucky. I'm always unlucky.\n\nEventually after another hour the cramps subsided and I felt better. A lot better. They came in to give each of us a conscious sedation injection... I barely felt the prick... I even asked the nurse if she had injected me yet and she had..\nI didn't feel the effects of the sedation weirdly enough... I felt awake.\n\nThe first one of us who were later on went in... The quiet one.. for the procedure. She let out a loud scream... But we heard the doctors tell her that the instrument only looks really big and it's not that bad... So the scream wasn't from pain it was from being scared. After that we didn't hear any more sounds.. But regardless it was nerve wrecking. She came out looking like she was in pain... She said it was really sore... This made me really nervous.\n\nThe nurse came to me and said she wasn't dilated enough but the girl wanted to go through with it like that. She said she wants the two of us to wait another hour. She also inserted one more misoprostol into us. This time I didn't feel cramps afterwards.\nThen it was my turn... I didn't even look at the instruments. I didn't want to. I felt very vulnerable with my pants off and legs separated while he... looked... but I soon forgot all about that. The doctor put the biggest one in that I assume opened up my cervix... It hurt so much whenever he twisted the instrument because I believe this was how he set it to open more... And then a large amount of blood gushed down my thighs... and into the bucket below me. Then he went in with his other instruments through the big one... He used these to pull out the products of conception along with the baby. I won't lie it was all very painful but... It was done in 15 minutes. He used a suction machine at the end to suck out any residual... And then as requested he put a copper IUD inside me. I didn't want another mistake to happen again. Through this whole procedure the nurse was very helpful. She held my hands the whole time and talked to me to distract me. At the moment I'm reading all about how the chances of an IUD falling out right after a second trimester abortion increases... But I can't quite confirm how much... And I can't feel my string properly because I shouldn't put my fingers up until at least a week after the abortion. to avoid infection. This all makes me worry quite a bit. I am neurotic.\n\nWhen he took out the instruments entirely I felt entirely normal. No more pain. I didn't even feel like I had just undergone surgery. I felt normal. I left the building after resting for 5 minutes and then went to meet up with my boyfriend in the visitor waiting room. He was standing there with an ice cream for me. I really love him for that. He's really amazing.\n\nThe ride home felt surreal. We had pizza and coke. A wonderful way to end the day. now it's 2 days later and even though I remember every single detail it feels so long ago. I keep feeling my stomach out of habit and feel so relieved when I feel nothing there. It's all squishy again.\n\nIf you remember earlier I mentioned I'm really neurotic. Before the time I stressed about everything. What if the First lift doesn't find us, what if he gets into an accident, what if we get lost. What if there's something wrong with my uterus or cervix and they can't do the procedure, what if the doctor dies, what if I'm further along than I thought and can't get it done anymore, what if the doctor doesn't pitch up, what if the second transport doesn't pitch up.... As you can see I worried about everything but in the end it all went really smoothly.\n\nI don't regret it at all. A lot of people will judge me for it but... To me... It was my decision and... I believe it's every persons right to choose whether they will be able to or not. My story may sound daunting to some girls out there but the pain really wasn't as bad... it was painful. But it was over so quickly that it didn't matter. This memory will be among the most memorable, But not in a bad way. In a good way.\n\nAt the moment my breasts have become incredibly sore, more than they were when I was pregnant. Actually they feel bruised. But the best part about this is they're about twice the size at the moment. They will go back to normal eventually (hopefully not) But for the moment I'm loving the size.\n\nUPDATE: Now it's a few days later and my breasts have tripled in size... Also I'm lactating so much I'm leaking through my padded bras... This is all pretty normal. And I don't even want to start on how sore my breasts are. Even standing hurts because they're getting pulled down. But I must say the increased cleavage is nice.\n\nSome tips I have for girls seeking an abortion: \nAs soon as you find out you're pregnant think about your decision... and then take action as soon as possible. The sooner the cheaper and less painful and the less side effects you'll have.\n Never try back street abortions. Ever. \nHave someone with you when you go for the procedure or medication... You'll need the support. \nWear comfortable clothes. You don't want anything obstructing you when the pain starts. \nAvoid speaking to other people there. You never know whether they'll make you feel better or worse. \nMake sure you have something to drink with you, and a lot of it. You get really thirsty. \nAlso you get really cold... So bring a jacket and wear long pants. \nWhen the procedure begins concentrate on anything else other than the pain. I stared at the roof and tried to find faces in the patterns. It helps.\n",

It's a profound and complex decision.\n\nGrieving is a healthy response to this loss. But also, you are feeling a sense of loss in your feelings toward her. You have been trying very hard to be supportive, but in the process you are hurting and feeling resentful. \n\nAbortions can impact relationships: Very often, accidental pregnancies and abortions do not cause relationship problems; they shine a spotlight on weaknesses in the relationship that already were there.  \n\nIt's important to remember that having a child and taking on the around-the-clock lifetime responsibility of raising a new human also puts a massive strain on a relationship. There are many divorces and broken relationships that involve children. Parenting is so much more difficult than society portrays it. It's best that both people be 100 percent willing, otherwise it is very unfair to the potential new human.\n\nPeople often talk about their own wants, but do not put at the center of consideration what is truly best for a potential new person. When a person continues a pregnancy they don't really want or are not fully ready for just to please a partner -- there are lifelong resentments that not only hurt the relationship between the partners, but cause hurt to the child.  A child deserves parents who are ready and willing to care for them with their whole heart. \n\nIt is healthy to grieve that your partner does not want to continue this pregnancy. My heart is with you for this loss. Here is a resource that may help you feel less alone: [https://www.abortionconversationprojects.org/especially-for-men](https://www.abortionconversationprojects.org/especially-for-men)\n\nShe has choices, and you have choices, too.

              "body": "Your feelings are valid, and you're so allowed  to feel what you're feeling.  I think it's really loving of you to help with the logistics of this and to support your girlfriend even as you wish it were different.  That must be very difficult indeed.  I see you doing your very best to be a responsible partner and also to honor your feelings at the same time.  This is huge, what you're doing, and you're doing a really great job. \n\nI support couples across the grief of pregnancy loss, and my most basic advice is this: You have to cast a wide net.  As much as you and your GF are in this together in that it is happening to you both, you really CAN'T be all the way in it together, as you so well know.  What this means, is that sometimes you are the least capable people to support each other in this moment.  You both have massive and worthy needs right now, and they are very different.  I tell my couples to cast a wide net for support.  This means, call a friend and talk to your friend.  Get a therapist and get professional support from therapy. If you feel weird about therapy (some people just do) get a coach to help you integrate your own worthy feelings and to be there for profound witnessing and holding. Join a men's group or support group. \n\nWhen you do want to show up for your girlfriend, for instance, when you'll be together tomorrow, the best I have for you is this: hold yourself with so much kindness and generosity that it's ok to be present with her hard feelings without trying to fix them.  A very common dynamic in heterosexual relationship is that the woman wants to be witnessed and the man wants to make it better.  If you relieve yourself of the responsibility to fix your GF's feelings or this situation, and just allow yourself to feel what you feel and let your GF feel what she feels, that's often more than enough.  It is harder than it sounds.  Go so gently with yourself and with her.  You're both hurting right now.  When the situation is confusing and overwhelming, focus on the feelings in your body.  Just stay in your body.  \n\nI'm so sorry that it's like this.  I wish it were easier.  Holding you and your GF gently in your own individual needs and honoring both of your very worthy feelings.",

Generally it's because she either never wanted to be a parent, or sees too many difficulties with becoming a parent *at this point in time.* \n\nVery few women express regret for the decision to abort, even if they are unhappy about the *necessity* for it, and grieve for the baby they were not ready to welcome into their life. \n\nIt's harder for you, as a man, because it is not your body doing the heavy lifting, even if you feel you are ready to become a father.

I'm still participating, in fact arranging everything myself. I bent over backwards to get her an appointment as she is still in the legalization process to live in my country, which made it a lot more difficult. Dozens of phone calls later and after visiting 3 health centers, the municipality and one hospital I finally got it. I went with her to the first appointment with the obstetrician. I paid for whatever fees there were to pay. I arranged for her to spend the next few days over and I'll be driving her to the hospital to take the first pill and I'll be staying at home with her when she takes the second one. There's no one else to do this with her and I don't know how she would've managed without me essentially taking up all the responsibilities and arranging everything.\n\nBut during the whole thing I'm just profoundly grieving and wishing she changes her mind last minute. I couldn't possibly abandon her but I hate everything I'm doing and I hate participating in this as I really want this baby (we both did in the beginning, as I said). On one hand I want to support her because this must be hard for her, there's no one else to do it and I love her. On the other hand I feel I need support myself and that I'm in no condition to be supportive. She has expressed the need to be by herself and I gave her space. And at the same time I'm feeling resentful because she knows I'm suffering a lot and I needed her to be there for me too. Maybe she isn't in a position to give that either and I can't demand it. But the fact remains that I'm continually repressing my feelings to force myself to support her through something I wholeheartedly hate all while I'm not getting what I need from her in this moment even tho we have talked about it extensively. She has barely talked to me these past 5 days while I'm being consumed by my thoughts and feelings by myself. And I've just shut up about it and let her be.\n\nTomorrow I'll be picking her up for her to come over and I'm feeling very worried and conflicted. On one hand I'm very hurt by the whole situation, by the fact she changed her mind about having the baby, by her pretty much leaving me alone with these feelings even tho I expressed the need for company and communication. On the other hand I need to be the one caring for her right now. I'll be the one accompanying her through the process, I should be the one providing her comfort in whatever way she needs, etc. I'm afraid my own feelings will prevent me from doing my part properly and turning the situation into something even worse than what it needs to be. In this moment I'm feeling intense grief, very intense regret for everything I've done and will need to do in the next few days, hopelessness, helplessness and lack of agency, resentment (and there's no point pontificating on how I have no right to feel it, I simply do and it's beyond my control), disconnection between us and abandonment. And this is not the emotional state I should be in while helping her through it. I'm afraid I'll either be overwhelmed by my feelings and make it all worse for her or, on the other hand, that I'll be capable of totally repressing how I feel just to be able to preform my part, definitely damaging myself further in the process, worsening the feelings of resentment in the future and probably destroying the chance of salvaging the relationship. Not to be a whiner, but holy shit do people underestimate how violent this experience can be for the father as well...\n\nI'm having a very hard time navigating this and there's not a lot of people I can turn to for support either. If you have any advice, please help me out. I very much dispense with scolding for feeling how I feel tho.",

        "body": "Before I begin I know the backlash I will get with the amount of stupidity that's about to be written down. I've was dating my gf for a year  (first relationship ever) and recently broke up with her, we had sex quite often and I was extremely careful with it, I always used a condom, never took it off during intercourse, and held onto the rim when pulling out to make sure it never slipped off. I always checked whether it broke after sex every single time, and of course there were no breaks every time so far. This is where my fuck up happened, when I was checking one time my dumb self decided to poke the condom with my finger and it ended up exploding on my hand. Some of the cum landed on her thigh, and immediately I was scared. I knew that 90% of it landed in my hands, as both hands were holding onto the condom, but the 10% was what scared me. All the cum that I could visible see was on her mid thigh, quite low from the actual vaginal area, but I nonetheless was scared that it could have got to that area. I talked about getting Plan B with my gf, but she convinced me that she didn't feel it land in that area. I kept insisting but she refused and said it was fine. (I know this sounds like me blaming her but believe me I realize that I should have stood my ground, not listened to her and bought her the Plan B just to be safe) \n\nA couple of weeks later she started getting terrible stomach cramps for a few weeks. She ended up going to the doctors and getting pregnancy tests, of these tests 2 came back positive and 1 negative. The doctor said that it was way too early to determine whether she was pregnant or not and to come back 3 weeks later if she did not get her period. The cramps continued with a lot of puking (we thought it was just a bad stomach flu or UTI). We discussed the possibility of having a child and both agreed that both of us were in no position to take care of a child (and thankfully in my province abortions are free and don't require an adult), I was adement on making sure she was emotionally fine during this whole process. Unfortunately, during the 3 week period, we broke up and just a few days ago she went in for the check up. She didn't get her period and doctors said it's close to 100% she is pregnant, they asked her for a urine test and that is now the deciding factor of whether she is or not. She texted me today, telling me she wanted to keep the child because \"it's wrong to not give the child a chance in life\" and that \"I have no decision in this because its her body\". It seems like she won't listen to my opinion, she says she will make sure the child will have nothing to do with me, but that isn't a solution to this.\n\nAm I wrong to be concerned of both of our futures? She has a plan to drop out of school for a semester and just home school to birth the child and just because I offered the idea of abortion I have no right to be a part of the child's life. I am going into university next year and really can't think of the stress this would put on myself or her in her final year of HS. I am worried of the criticism she faces from her family, her mother is abusive and her friends (as well as mine) when they discover the potential child. I am genuinely afraid of what lies next in the next chapter of both of our lives.\n\nI also don't think I could live with the guilt of having the child born and putting them up for adoption. To see the amount of children jump from foster home to foster home and end up in a cyclical disaster pains me. I don't think she understands the amount of pain the child will go through being born this early into her life, she neither has the fund or support to raise a child and nor do I coming from a low income family. I really am afraid down the line, maybe 6 months in, she decides not to have the child and asks me to come back, I don't know what I would do or how I would handle it.\n\nI'm sorry this post is so long, if you made it this far you have my gratitude. I'm genuinely a mess and have never felt so defeated in my life. ",

Your hormones are trying to go back to normal, you're processing your experience, and coming to terms with your new reality. It can be a huge transition. I really struggled in that time, and I didn't even see my fetus. Let yourself feel the pain and try not judge it or yourself. The more you try to block it out, the worse it will get. Give yourself this time to process your emotions and what you just went through. You may never feel 100% sure of your decision, but you do have control over what your life will look like from now on. Live it to the fullest, finish school strong, educate others about your experience, find compassion for others who have been in your position. If you'd like, you can honor your baby in various ways. I keep the sonogram in a pretty little box on my nightstand, topped with a statue of Jizo (a bodhisattva who guides the souls of those lost to miscarriage and abortion through their karmic journey).

This is simply due to pregnancy hormones taking a while to go away even though you are technically no longer pregnant. I read online just now that the pregnancy hormone hCG can take anywhere between 16 days up to 2 months to completely go away. Generally, a faint positive line appearing isn't something to really worry about since the hormone does stay around in your body for a while even after the abortion was successful. It should be nothing of real concern, as long as your uterus is empty you should be good.\n\nIf you are still feeling anxious however, I would see a doctor before taking anything. I have no idea what taking additional misoprostol can do when the uterus is empty so my best advice would be to not take that risk.

Was I on birth control in the past? Yes! Was I on it currently? No. Why you May ask. Well it made me feel unstable is the most honest answer. Without it I feel like a normal person. On it I could fight everyone including my parents. Not good. And in my freshman year of college I felt that I didn\u2019t want to be stuck with a person who was as irresponsible as the man I was dating. Selfish as that sounds, it was the truth. He couldn\u2019t hold a job and was a repeat cheater. So I made the choice I made. I can\u2019t take it back. I go to the facility with my mother. They explain everything to me. I choose to have no medication to knock me out. Honestly I felt that if I was going to make such a choice I needed to feel the  consequence of my actions. I wish I would have been knocked out. \nTaking me back they gave me ample opportunities to change my mind. But when the machine began and they started the procedure I honestly felt like Jesus left my body. I know that there\u2019s a lot of naysayers that will claim I\u2019m a religious person but truth be told this is not the case. We may have briefly went to Sunday school a handful of times but it was not shoved down my throat as a child. I literally felt something in my soul leave my body as I lay there on the table and I knew what it was that was leaving my body. It was something you can only describe as religious. I started to cry uncontrollably. They removed me from the room and put me in warming chairs. I look up and there\u2019s a woman next to me asking me if I\u2019m OK. I tell her no. She tells me it\u2019ll be OK you just have to ask for forgiveness and when I look up she\u2019s gone. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m forgiven for that choice that I made but I will never forget it. I have lived every day since then hoping that my good actions as a good person will buy my good graces back into the light. I think I\u2019m right. I will never do that again and I think everybody should be awake so they can feel that as well. But I have to tell you that I still feel like the truth is it\u2019s my body my choice.  But stay awake. Know what you getting into",

We went to a doctor to get checked and because my haemoglobin was low they couldn't give me the pill as that could have caused a heart failure. But after the process of getting checked, testing for STDs and sonography I climbed up hill( his apartment was 5min walk uphill) to my boyfriend's place and I had an iron fusion that day. My heartbeat was fast like anything but I slowly calmed down. That very day I started bleeding little bit like spotting then next day a lot and I did talk to my gynaecologist and she said I was have a miscarriage but since I intended to have an abortion it was a good news. The whole process took more than a week and was so fucking painful. I felt as if someone grabbed my lower intestine and was pulling it put of my body. Contractions would come and go. I was traveling in metro when I first started having the strong ones it was very painful. We took few days off and went to a hill station nearby which was preplanned but that helped me be calm and with my partner during this period. I'm grateful to have him by my side and him doing the right thing. \n\nIt all happened to fast and I was so calm with my partner that when it was over we celebrated but I never processed what happened. I remember getting my sonography done and hearing the child's heartbeat (which was for nano seconds as the doctor didn't intend it to be on) that was very painful and I felt connected to the child and that was probably the first moment I felt guilty but at the same time I knew it was the right thing to do.\n\nI could feel it inside me and then leave me. It was an experience like anything I didn't want it but for a moment I felt I could love it. After my miscarriage I had several panic attacks and daily nightmares. Every day a child would die in my dreams or I would be bleeding and a child would be crying. It all stopped after I had a false pregnancy scare. But I never got to process it.",

The first week I was happy then I believe God was reminding me of the promises I made , during the scare I told God if I ever start to stray remind me how scared I was during my pregnancy and what I went through and he did just that, I started having anxiety, the same anxiety I had when I found out I was pregnant. Heart palpitations , no appetite, disgusted, all these things caused by my anxiety. He gave me back those same feelings. Just like I was in denial of being pregnant after I took multiple test .I was in denial after I saw the fetus. Days went by I ask God to give me a sign, everything is okay and everything is done. He gave me 2 signs. I booked an ultrasound just help my peace of mind. Uterus was empty, nothing in ovaries, uterus line not thick, just empty. I felt relief but again my anxiety and thinking still haunts me, this is something that I have to deal with, God took care of the rest, I just have to learn to Trust in him.

When I first found out I was pregnant, I was surprised, excited... and a little scared. It wasn't something we had planned. \n\nFrom the beginning, I was horribly ill. I couldn't keep down anything, I felt exhausted all the time, and my emotions were barely controllable. I felt uncertain and uneasy all the time. My significant other made a comment is passing about being afraid about how broke we would be. In that moment, I snapped. I went home, scheduled the appointment, and felt like I had made a final decision.\n\nHe kept asking me if I was sure. If this was what I wanted. I had a nagging doubt, but I kept going forward anyway. I felt like I didn't have the time to make a proper decision. I don't know why. I felt rushed. But I didn't want anyone to see my indecision. And so I did it.\n\nIt was an awful, painful experience. I don't think any amount of research can fully prepare you for what happens; not just during the appointment, but the weeks following. I know there is variation for some and perhaps mine was devastating because I wasn't sure. Every time I hear a vacuum I feel like I have a panic attack.\n\nI regretted my decision before it was even done. When they led me to the recovery room, it took every bit of strength not to cry... I didn't want the nurses to ask me questions. I thought with time I would feel better, but if anything, I feel worse. I feel like I'm almost constantly on the verge of having a panic attack or about to have one. I don't know if it's the panic or depression, but I feel like I barely have any energy or appetite. My hair has drastically thinned. To top it off, I started a new job 2 months after it, which hasn't helped at all. \n\nMy relationship has deteriorated. He tried to help me. He tried to be supportive of what he thought I wanted. He tries to be there for me and all I do is hate him and push him away. I don't want to be around my family or friends. I can't even talk to anyone about it. I try to talk to him but I feel like it just intensifies his guilt. The few people I have talked to about my feelings think I had a miscarriage because I cannot bring myself to admit to what I have done. I feel like I am on the verge of falling into a black hole... one I have created for myself.\n\nI don't feel like I know myself anymore. I don't judge anyone for anything they do: only you know your own life. But I never thought I could do this. And all I hear echoing is my brain is that I am a murderer. I killed something defenseless and innocent for reasons that I don't even know and can't explain. I never believed in God before, but now I think He can't forgive me, especially if I can't forgive me. I hate myself. Every day, I hate myself.\n\nI know I probably need to see someone or get on medication but even the thought of having to discuss this with a stranger makes me worry about the judgement. I am even nervous posting this, despite the anonymity, but I feel like if I don't let some of this out, I am going to explode.",

Sorry for any formatting issues, my brain is scattered right now.\n\nI've been on some form of birth control for the past 6 years at least, & for the most part I haven't had any periods. I had depo which skipped my periods completely, nuvaring which I would sometimes use to skip my periods intentionally & sometimes not, mirena which I skipped my periods completely, & most recently I've been on birth control pills for about nine months. I've skipped the placebo week twice with these pills but when I didn't I still didn't have my period. Basically the last time I had a period was when I used the ring which was about 4 years or so ago. Also I'm quite overweight so I didn't notice any physical changes to my body. I swear I just had no way to know.\n\nI started feeling a weird pressure on my bladder about a week & a half ago which I thought was a UTI but I had a weird nagging feeling that I should check if I was pregnant so I took a test 2 days ago & it was positive. I took a second test yesterday morning, also positive. My bf & I have been together for a long time & we discussed very early on that we did not want kids now or ever, which is why I've been on BC for so long. We also agreed that worst case scenario, I would abort. We've both always been very outspokenly pro choice, so none of this should have been an issue. So I had an appointment this morning for an ultrasound at planned parenthood to see if I was within the timeframe to do a medication abortion or if I need to come back & do it in clinic. Since I don't have periods I just didn't know, but I hoped beyond hope I could at least do it in clinic.\n\nNope. I am at 29 weeks 6 days. I am very pregnant. I'm past the limit for my state (CA) so they gave me the number of a clinic in NM to call to get me in or they said to try one in CO. I've been sobbing all morning. I've been frantically calling both places trying to find out what would be better, I'm trying to make travel plans, my boyfriend is being amazing and supportive but honestly I think he's in shock. I'm in shock. I called out of work because I don't know if I can face people right now. I have a picture of the ultrasound & my bf's mom almost saw it (we live with her) & I almost threw up. I should have known but I swear there was no way to know, nothing seemed off except the stupid bladder thing. I was tired but I'm always tired. I didn't get morning sickness or anything. After the first test I started noticing things like my ankles are swollen. I would get weird little pangs in my stomach too, but I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me but it's a fucking baby kicking me in my stomach & I can't process it. I just can't process this.\n\nThe clinic said it could be up to 25k for the procedure, not including travel & lodging obviously. I have to call my parents & tell them I'm fucking pregnant & need money to get rid of it & I don't know how. I don't know if they have money. I don't talk to them much. I know I'm very lucky that I even have someone to ask. I'm trying to remind myself that this could be so much worse and that everything will be ok but I just feel sick. I'm trying not to think of what will happen if I can't make it & I have to have a baby. I'm so scared of being pregnant I can't even look at my body right now, looking at my stupid ankles makes me panic. I can't even think about BIRTHING A CHILD. I never wanted this. Even when I was younger I never wanted this. I was so careful. I don't want to turn my whole life upside down to take care of a child. I was going to go to school. I had so many plans. But what if I have the baby to adopt it out & I see it & I can't give it away? I already feel so much unexpected guilt. I never thought I would care but every time I get that little pang all I can think is that's my baby? My poor little baby.\n\nI'm so scared. I don't even know why I'm writing this anymore. I just want all of this to go away. I feel sick & I can't stop crying. I just want everything to be ok. I feel so stupid. I should've asked a long time ago why my periods never came back but I didn't think it would matter. By the math this thing was made in MAY. I can't comprehend that at all. I've been drinking & smoking the whole time. What if I have to have the baby & something's wrong with it? I'm losing my mind. I can't believe I didn't know.\n\nSorry if you read all this but thank you. I don't even have a question specifically. I'm just scared.  \n\n\n  \nEDIT/UPDATE: Hi there, just wanted to update so that people know I'm not freaking out anymore. I suppose I just needed to write it down & get it out of my head & into the universe. Thank you so much to those that commented, I truly appreciate it. I have my appointment, travel, & lodging set so I'm just working on the funding for the rest of it now (which admittedly is a lot, but my head is on straight now so I feel confident about it). I'm probably going to be making phone calls for the rest of the day so I'll be getting right to that. My sincere thanks to the people of this sub.   \n\n\nside note if a mod sees this - I didn't lock the post myself (assuming a mod has to do that?) but can the post just stay locked? Not sure if I'm allowed to delete posts but I think I have all the info I need. My DMs are off but I'd like to avoid people coming and leaving nasty comments on this as well. Thank you! Much love.",

It was the hardest decision of my life to choose not to keep it- but it truly was not the right time to bring a baby into the world. \n\nI know the day of the procedure was difficult for him.

It\u2019s been so great- thank you to everyone. Y\u2019all are so great, loving, and supportive. My next step might be a talkline, I\u2019m not sure yet.

If so, do you think he had a chance to grieve in his own way? Even if he has been through his own grief process, he should respect the fact that you are still experiencing grief. You should always be able to turn to your partner during hard times without judgement or fear of being vulnerable.\n\nI'm really sorry that you are experiencing so much pain and a lack of support from those who should be the most supportive. If you need to talk, feel free to send me a private message. There are a lot of good resources out there to help the emotional healing process after abortion.

And I *assure* you, there are *plenty* of men out there that can and will love you for who you are and will treat you with the respect you deserve. \n\nBut depending on how long ago you had your MA, it is *possible* your hormones are raging and it is *possible* that you freaked yourself out when you were reading those Reddit posts. So you need to ask yourself if this behavior that you are experiencing is something that has happened in the past. Has your boyfriend been generally supportive right up until now? If so, then maybe he is legitimately not aware of your need for support. Or maybe he is also having issues about it or maybe stress at school or work, or all of it put together. \n\nErgo if this behavior is new, then maybe just calmly talk with him about it.

Oh NO, I'm not!\n\nI'll be damned if I have a 8 year old and a 22 month old and a newborn?

I have no strength, I have nothing now, nothing at all. \n\nCalled Planned Parenthood and scheduled for the following Weds. to rid myself of this known burden in process. They said, \"Maam, it will be $375 without anesthesia and $400 with it.\" I said, pencil me in for the $400 baby!\" \n\nGreat! That's in place so back to drawi g board on what the hell was I going to so with my life as I certainly could not continue to live in the home we did together. Oh, the $273,000 Dominion home we were closing on the am he was killed? Yeah, that's a no go too.\n\nNo way could I move forward and move in that place in Obetz with the white picket fence, deck and all options without him.

Understand, however, that crisis and circumstances can sway initial concrete ethical beliefs. Or topics of grand debate. Mind your business and let people do what is best for them.\n\nI was against abortion with no room for reconsideration, until I was faced with crisis and loss. \n\nMy heart would not allow me go do it but I cannot ever speak for another person without walking in their shoes. I will only support and respect whatever decision a person I know and love makes.\n\nI say this because I had a friend who has been in my life since age 15yrs. She knows me and my heart. You know what she said when I told her I was having an abortion? You know what she SAID?\n\n\"I am here for you no matter what you decide, I can't advise you on what to do because I have not been through what you are going through. I am here for you!\"\n\nI was an Secreatry when he died. When I went back to work I was promoted to Executive Secretary (got that role at 8 months pregnant). Went back to school, now a BSN, RN; Legal Nurse; Life Care Planner, expert hands down but more importantly...\n\nI am a mom and a damn good one! \n\nThat child scheduled for termination is grown and my last baby from my womb. I have a grandbbaby now and so happy I made the choices I did. The choices for me, my children and my life. \n\nStill not out of the woods mental status wise but I have coping mechanisms that help and no need for medications - Thank GOD!\n\nIt remains difficult but managable. \n\nI am back on course now and can clearly reflect these days. But I too turned on GOD. I too went against once stated advocacy for non abortion but now I can say, it was my decision, my life, my choice.",

I know you want a woman's opinion who has actually dealt with this, but I thought I would throw in some food for thought on when a fetus is considered \"life\". \n\nFrom what I read, the brain and other organs don't start to appear until about 10 weeks in. Without a brain, there is no way a fetus is able think, feel pain, feel emotion, ect... basically anything that would make it a conscious living thing. It's only alive in the same sense that cells are alive or plants are alive. Even when the brain first appears, doesn't mean it has attained consciousness. As the brain starts to grow and develop, that's when the issue gets pretty sticky (in terms of whether or not it is a life).\n\nI'm just looking at this from a biological perspective (which probably makes me sound like a robot). I'm not very religious/spiritual so I'm not even going to get into the whole soul business.\n\n\n**I hope you get a more knowledgeable answer from women who have actual experience with abortion.**",

        "body": "I have been giving the topic some serious consideration recently after  overhearing some friends talk about the subject. I personally don't like the idea of abortions, but currently support a woman's right to do so. I have grown an immense respect for life over the years and even have trouble killing things I don't like (roaches, spiders) these days. I don't claim to be righteous or anything like that, it's just where my heart is at. Everyone has a different view and I want to understand yours.\n\nWhat I am curious about is how women who have had abortions have rationalized the decision. When do you feel that a fetus is considered life, and did that affect your decision at all. How long/often do you have thoughts about it afterwards and is there ever any regret. Do you think there is a better way of dealing with unplanned pregnancy? I am not here to judge. I just want to better understand.\n\nThe reason I support a woman's right to abort is because I believe it is sadly the best option for how our society/communities currently operates. In my ideal world, people would be joyous at the news of a new life on the way to joining the community and the possibility and potential it brings. Mother's wouldn't fear an unplanned pregnancy because they would be secure in the support of the community around them to help raise the child and provide all it needs to reach it's full potential.\n\nThis type of change would require people to put the interest of others before themselves though and I realize that such a thing isn't likely to happen any time soon. Some may say it's impossible, but if you think about it, it's well within our grasp.\n\nSo once again, this thread isn't about judging or shaming others. I hope others can show self control and respect that. This thread is about honestly sharing the tales of your abortions and any positives and negatives you think others should be aware of. Help people like me better understand please.",

Going forward, please don\u2019t think abortion is acceptable as THE PLAN. Abortion is physically, mentally, and emotionally harder than anything you\u2019ll ever have to do in your lifetime. To expect it of a woman should be criminal. Please take the necessary steps not to need an abortion, I\u2019m terrified that someone as unintelligent as you can procreate.

I don\u2019t want children. \n2. Even if I was going to have children I would not want her to be the mother. \n3. I don\u2019t want to pay child payments. \n4. I don\u2019t want the child to have a shit life. \n\nShe said that she might decide to ship the child to her home country (Philippines) and that she would not ask me for money. But at this point I don\u2019t trust her, and after despite me trying, her communication is so bad I can\u2019t stand being around her. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. The worst part is this is not fair to the kid to not have a father, or a proper family. \n\nI don\u2019t know how I can convince to have an abortion. If she doesn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know how to avoid not paying child support if she changes her mind.

Every step and every turn in my life has taught me this. The world is dark, and it's cruel, and it's unjust. \nBut I made peace with that. Not only not having a child-like because, yes, you're right, there are babies and more kids and even more teenagers who are so desperately looking for home, and I could definitely put all my love into them. But with raising any child, I believe you have a part to show them- yes! The world is dark and terrible and sad and there is so much unfairness. But you can still have your own beauty and you can still have your own light and happiness, despite all that. \nI really love caring and teaching.

We are young and we aren't even together. I would devote my life to this child, but if my life doesn't have the means to fully support a child- not just emotionally, which I know I would- then it just isn't possible. \n\nI'm going to have to mourn this child, I know. But I know I don't have the support to fully let them live their beautiful life. \n\nIn the future, I would think about not what you're saying, but who you're saying it to and when. I am obviously sad that I can't give this child a life. I can't give this child a life. I am sad about it. Where would that invite a discussion on how this child shouldn't be born anyway? Regardless of why you believe that, why say that to me? \n\nThe world is dark and sad now. But children are the future, and you can set them up to be able to be full of light and warmth and happiness regardless. I'm sorry you didn't receive that. ",

        "body": "My heart hurts. My head feels really clear, more than it has in a very long time from how anxious I've been, and how depressed I was before that- which lasted much longer. \n\nI quickly moved out of my family house because it was getting violent living there with my brother. I [18] moved in with R [22] and his family as an in-between situation. We're extremely close. I'm very much in love with him, and I believe he feels the same. We aren't in a relationship anymore- it was very on-off for a long time. It was my fault, I wasn't faithful to him and I was extremely unsure because of how good and loving he was to me. We've been extremely unsafe the whole course of us having sex. He finishes inside almost every time we have sex. There was never a problem, first because I was on a hormone treatment that prevented conception, and after I stoppes because, hey, nothing happened and my sister has PCOS, so I just assumed I was also infertile. But a few years later, we now live together. \n\nMy periods stopped for over a year, then I had two in a cycle. Then I skipped a cycle, then one more in November. Now nothing again.\n\nMy anxiety has had me throwing up routinely in the morning for almost two years, I smoke a lot of weed because of it. We've taken tests before because of these reasons, and they were always negative.  Recently my emotions have been getting WHACK though, I'm extremely jealous and clingy with R. I'm so emotional, and it's so different than the extremes of how I usually feel. \n\nSo we bought a pack of two. I took one. Positive. Again in the morning. Positive. \n\nHe knows and I know that we don't really have the means to support a child, no matter how much I want it to work. He's told me before when I was really struggling with the infertility that I would've made a fantastic mother. And you know what? He would be a perfect counterpart for that. For all of my empathy, he has his logic, and I think that would be very good as a balance for parents. He would be a perfect father. \n\nAnd now I have our baby in me, right now. \n\nI know a lot of people who get abortions have a kind of different mindset, and rightfully so. This isn't a baby right now, it's just cells. Even with a heartbeat or even a brain, a baby does truly come alive after birth. To argue when a life truly has value or should be considered a life is something far, far greater than anything we're capable of comprehending. We don't know, to try to decide when is pointless. The value that a parent has the responsibility of giving is simply in the situation that the child comes into and is raised with. \n\nBut I still feel an inexplicable feeling. I was convinced I was pregnant every time I wasn't. I have a joke with myself that every gut feeling is usually the opposite of what happens. This time I was convinced I wasn't, and I kind of chuckled about about the possibility that me feeling like I wasn't meant that I was. And then I was. \nI feel so clear-headed since I found out. I get really in my head and confused, but everything is making sense now- about everything. \nI can only think about that this isn't a baby, but it could be. It could be a whole life and a whole child and a whole person to help figure out the entire universe with, and try to teach them it. I want to be a mother so fucking bad, and I want this baby so fucking bad. I want to hold them and look at their eyes and feel their skin and smell them. I want to see who they grow up to, I want to know who they will look like and if we could see ourselves in them. I want to know what music they'd like and how we'd embarrass them. \n\nBut I shouldn't and I can't have it right now. \nIt just sucks. And I'm sad. Because it has to happen. But I wish it didn't. \n\n",

        "body": "Hi everyone! I need advice on my situation and let me just say it\u2019s a VERY complicated situation. So 2 years ago I started a relationship with a guy that happens to be my cousin. Yes I know this is very weird and it\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of at all. It\u2019s a tough situation cause I truly love him and he\u2019s the perfect guy minus the cousin part. \nI truly wish we weren\u2019t related at all. He feels the same way. He is 13 years older and we didn\u2019t grow up together. We really didn\u2019t start being around one another until I was 20 (currently 25).\n\nFast forward to December 2020 I found out I was pregnant. No one in my family knew about the relationship or situation. When I broke the news to my family they were shocked, disgusted, and angry. They completely excommunicated my cousin and told me the only option was abortion. Like I said I\u2019m not proud of the situation at all I just couldn\u2019t help who I loved. \n\nI had been planning on keeping the baby but ended up caving into my family and getting the abortion. That abortion was and continues to be very traumatic for me. I was 13 weeks pregnant at the time of the abortion. My parents and pretty much my family that is aware of the situation never discusses the situation and acts like it never happened. They basically act like my cousin was never part of the family. I myself am embarrassed by the situation. \n\nFor the past two years I\u2019ve been back in the relationship with him and my family doesn\u2019t know. If they knew they\u2019d be furious. I\u2019ve gone back and fourth between loving him and wanting to be with him but also knowing I\u2019ll never get to live a free open love life if I\u2019m with him. And that I\u2019ll never have any family support. It\u2019s basically like living a secret life.\n\nI\u2019m a week late and this morning something in me said take a test so I did. It came back positive and I don\u2019t know what to do. I wanna be excited but feel anxious and depressed. \nI haven\u2019t told him yet and don\u2019t know if I will. He has made it clear if I got pregnant again he thinks we should keep it. I just know my family would never be supportive. I\u2019m debating on having another abortion but feel the guilt already. I am truly lost and feel like I have no one to talk to. \n\nPart of me wants to rush and schedule an abortion and not tell anyone not even the baby\u2019s father. Another part of me is debating telling my family. I honestly don\u2019t know if I have it in me to tell them again. The first time was extremely scary and they obviously didn\u2019t take the news well. I have no doubt it would be the same situation. I also don\u2019t know if I want another abortion. I\u2019m so lost\u2026\n\nMy question is what should I do? Any advice is greatly appreciated. \n\nYes I know this is a fucked up situation to say the least but I ask for you to please try and reserve judgement.\n\nAlso I live in the U.S. and technically cousin marriage is legal in my state. I live in the North Eastern part of the U.S. but it is not common here at least to my knowledge. And it is not something \u201cnormal\u201d in my family.",

In the week after my MA, I was feeling the same way as you, I experienced so many different emotions in that week that it felt like a month.. but as I was processing what I\u2019d just gone through and what I\u2019d done, I noticed that my brain kept trying to make the thoughts of me keeping the baby a fantasy almost. For example, my brain conveniently erased every single reason I made the decision in the first place from my thoughts surrounding \u201cif I had kept the baby\u201d what all of that would look like, it\u2019s like my mind had replaced reality with fantasy where everything would\u2019ve perfectly fallen into place and I would\u2019ve had my \u201cperfect child\u201d and been fulfilled and happy. It was only through talking it over with my mom that I was reminded what reality would\u2019ve been if I had kept it, and it wasn\u2019t good (just to keep my post short, I\u2019ll leave it at that). So, I do understand where you\u2019re coming from, there\u2019s so many emotions to process and it\u2019s okay to feel the way you do, be kind to yourself, you\u2019ve been through so much having to make such an extremely difficult decision. My advice is to process the grief, I wrote my almost little one a small letter and then got a necklace with their due date birth flower and I wear it everyday \ud83d\udc95. Allow yourself to process the grief, talk to a professional if you need to, and try not to let your mind create a fantasy of what could have been. I\u2019m willing to listen if you ever need to vent, I won\u2019t give any unwelcome advice \ud83d\ude0a. Hang in there, internet friend \ud83d\udc95 big hugs to you!",

I think people, particularly pro-choice and pro-abortion persons, like to misuse the word fetus in inferring that a fetus is innately inhumane; however, the word is simply describing a stage of human development.  It is important for all of us to remember that a fetus is it's own unique human organism, with it's own biological functions, organs, dna, etc.  The uterus is the predetermined home for any small human. It does not mean that a fetus is not human.  If we use the premise that stages of human development determine the value of a human as a person (assuming that we can lead a pro-chocie or abortion to even admitting that a fetus is indeed human life, for it can not be anything else), then it is fair to say that a 13 year olds  life is much more valuable over the life of a one year old, simply because of their stage of human development and function. \n\nBTW, for people reading this... no, I'm not some crazy christian white pro-life evangelical dude. 21/F.

An egg , sperm,  or any other tissue (that is not an unborn child), if left unmolested,  will never grow into an adult. It seems simple and clear to me.

I would post sources here, but due to the graphic (real) nature of them, they would be removed. I would be more than happy to direct message you various sources in order to back this up (: ).  \nI notice that many people say these images are \"disturbing\", and it is important to ask yourself why you are disturbed: If abortion is simply a medical procedure that we adamantly support, why should we be disturbed by the remains/product of the very thing we support? Is it perhaps a moral repulsion? Why do we not wish to see something we support, or perhaps do not support, but would still rather look away? What is so bad about these images that causes one to look away?\nIt might be good to consider that we have become desensitized to the reality of abortion, because it is a \"hidden\" procedure. That is a possibility as to why these images evoke repulsions similar to that of photos of dead and stacked holocaust victims, for some people. The fetus is torn apart, or injected with poison in the womb, yet images of it removed are disturbing (morally repulsive? It is safe to assume that an image of a human heart would most likely not conjure up similar feelings as, for example, an aborted 20 week old fetus). \nThese are all very difficult questions to ask, but necessary.  As a pro-life person, I think it is important for both sides to ask these questions, most importantly, what is so intrinsically disturbing about photos of aborted fetuses? Why is an ultrasound not disturbing, but rather for most, a joyful and \"miraculous\" experience? \nFor me, the answer is the noticeable difference between innocent, natural life, and the intentional and literal ruining of it.  \n\n**Edit** Another note on the guys: It is also extremely inappropriate, chances are there are women there or around who have had abortions and who knows what sort of emotions these images can stir up.  That would be awful!! While their message is true, the messenger certainly sucks!",

To respond to another one of your statements, I think I would be more disturbed by a human heart displayed in the same fashion as that of the fetus on the poster, because it would be dissection at a deeper level. The heart is not something you see every day, in real life at least, while the limbs of a fetus resemble similar depictions that we view constantly from real people. A dissected human heart would only be able to be shown through the killing (permanent or temporary) of a grown human. Now, I am not saying grown people are more human than fetuses, as that concept is just silly, but that developed human beings are all that we can relate to from the human species. Again, this does not go to say that I was any less disturbed by the posters.\n\nAlso, why are anti-abortionists called pro-life? I think that term is too vague and can be manipulated in too many ways. For example, pro-life could represent vegetarianism, where common animals raised for meat should be kept alive. It could also mean that the death penalty (currently in use in other countries) should be removed, or that animals should not be hunted at all. Hell, I could start a cause for the lives of worms because they are used for fishing bait, and should be saved! The term is too vague, and while it is not wrong, I don't think it is appropriate.",

I have taken valium for an mri and I ended up falling asleep in the mri machine. Ask your doctor about valium, xanax, or clonapin but because you\u2019re being put under it may not be possible. The good thing is, other than the IV you will feel nothing during the procedure and not remember a thing! I got my wisdom teeth out and did twilight sedation.

You have been through a lot, physically and emotionally, and it's especially painful when our reproductive situations have an impact on our relationships with our partner and others. \n\nMy understanding is that abortions do not cause PCOS or harm fertility. The science so far indicates that PCOS has links to genetics, and people who have an abortion -- even more than one abortion -- go on to have children. Here's a page that explains and gives links to trusted research: https://www.2plusabortions.com/ive-had-abortions-can-i-still-get-pregnant\n\nPeople, including anti-choice doctors, who are against abortions (they are mostly men and people who don't even have periods much less pregnancies) intentionally put out a lot of misinformation to scare people about abortions. This is so unfair, cruel and manipulative, and it actually harms people. \n\nBut I don't mean to get off track. More importantly, I am sending lots of empathy and respect to you. And my admiration for you is so high it is off the charts. \n\nIt sounds like, as you are looking back on the weeks before you ended your pregnancy, you are able to see yourself with clear eyes, and with tender compassion in your heart. You are returning in your mind to the person you were then, and you are seeing her as she truly was -- a good, beautiful person dealing with the total unfairness of an accidental pregnancy that came at the wrong time and in the poorest circumstances for raising a new human being.\n\nIt's clear you have such a loving heart, as you still speak of the wishes of wanting to please your partner. It's easy to see you did your best to weigh everything out. I think in your gut you knew that having a baby you didn't really want at the time, just to please him, was not fair to you or to a potential new human. It's wonderful you were able to hear and listen to your own wisdom.\n\nI have seen that abortions get blamed for everything -- including relationship break-ups. Then people spend a lot of time punishing themselves with dreamy visions about how happy life would have been if only they had not ended the pregnancy, as if giving birth and parenting an infant through to adulthood is romantic and blissful. (Check out the divorce rate, the number of single parents, the number of kids in foster care.)\n\nI think having these dreamy, romantic, wishful kinds of thoughts from time to time is absolutely human and normal. We all look back and wonder 'what it' about lots and lots of things in our lives.  But getting stuck there in dreamland is so destructive and harmful.\n\nIt sounds like you are being realistic and that's so wise. \n\nOften pregnancies, births, abortions and miscarriages -- just like other major life events -- are not the true problem in relationships. They are only the spotlights that reveal the cracks in relationships. Sometimes people work through these situations and repair the cracks, other times they realize that it's best to move on. \n\nI am not a physician or a therapist or anything like that, just a person with experiences, so take what I say with a boatload of salt:)\n\nA lot of people get stuck in thought loops about 'what if I had kept the baby' and they punish themselves for their choice, and they forget that they were doing their best to be realistic in a hard and unfair pregnancy situation.\n\nHere's the kind of 'what if' thinking that can come years later  -- What if I had been kinder to myself? What if I had looked back with empathy and understanding on the person I was in those days and weeks of facing the unfairness of an accidental pregnancy? What if I had not spent so much time punishing her and whipping her with harsh and judgmental thoughts? What if I had given her the love, respect, support and understanding she deserved?\n\nI have faith in you. Even though what you are going through is hard and painful, you are being kind to you. And your post here helps show others the way. I know people will read your words and it will help them to be more realistic and less harsh to themselves. \n\nI can ramble on, so sorry. \n\nOne final resource I want to share if you have not already seen it -- it's about other people who tried their best using contraceptive methods and they still got pregnant anyway.

And I was taking every precaution not to get pregnant. I am still with the boyfriend of 3 years ago and upon hearing this he got very snippy at me. He has been ignoring me and not being as lovey as I know him to be. I realize that he wants to be a father, and he wanted that baby we aborted at first. But we talked alot about it and he also couldn't afford to be a father at the time and he was struggling with alcohol abuse too at the time(neither our families could have helped out financially as well)\n\nI know he's mad. I know he regrets the abortion now. I know he resents me for having it. And now I'm just sitting here, wondering if it was a mistake to have the abortion. And I feel guilty for not giving him that child.\n\nBut, to be honest,  I am actually glad how everything turned out because I don't want a baby. I really don't.  I have thought about it. And I think this was a sign that I should not have a child, but also that my boyfriend and I should break up.\n\n\nEdit: I know my abortion did not cause my PCOS. Redditor JustCompassion posted a great link about it in my comments(Thank you!).  It's just the fact that I was hit with the \"getting pregnant again with your low fertility count will be hard\" speech has impacted the way I feel about the abortion, and my relationship is suffering because of it.",

        "body": "I was 18, barely graduating high school. I can\u2019t even remember the exact moment I found out. But I will never forget making the call. I remember googling it, where I should go, how much it would be, the time I was able to get it done. I didn\u2019t even do my own grocery shopping, but here I was making the call to terminate my first pregnancy. I was strong and confident on the phone, I knew what I had to do and I got it done. There was no \u201cthinking\u201d about it, there was no second guessing. I used to joke before this and say \u201cI\u2019d abort it\u201d like it was so easy, some kind of joke. \nI stayed home from school that day. My sisters were already graduated. I remember they were together in my big sisters room, I walked in feeling like an intruder, as I always did, this time was different. They looked at my face and they knew instantly something was wrong. I couldn\u2019t speak at first, by now the tears must have been pretty clear. \u201cI just made an appointment to get an abortion\u201d, I blurted out. Shock was the only thing I could detect from their faces. We were smart, we worked hard but we played hard too. We had the kind of reputation that people thought of us at a young age. The, \u201cthey\u2019ll be pregnant at 17\u201d, kind of girls. We proved them wrong. \nMaybe that was one reason I decided to terminate, maybe it was fear of what our parents would think, maybe it was what society would think and what my future would hold. I was 18, barely graduating high school\u2026\n\nI was 24, the best me I have ever been. My family was proud, my friends were proud, I was finally proud of ME. You never know what the golden years are until you have surpassed them. You don\u2019t know when it\u2019ll happen, you don\u2019t know when it\u2019ll go away. I recently got promoted, moved to a new city and was ready to kick ass! He was an employee of mine and I fell. I fell hard and I fell fast. The can\u2019t eat, can\u2019t sleep, reach for the stars, over the fence, world series kind of stuff. Three months in, I\u2019m pregnant. Clearly making the obvious decision to terminate with his consent completely, we did what felt right. \nFast forward to another 6 months, I found myself pregnant again. I thought about this time, what I would do and how much I loved him, I wanted to keep it. When I told him, his reaction said it all, there was no question, we had to terminate. I would never have had a child with someone who did not want one. I was young and eager to continue my career so I was quick to agree with yet another termination.\nHere we go again, three more months later, \u201cWHAT IS MY PROBLEM\u201d, I thought to myself. How could I be so evil to think it\u2019s okay to use abortion as a contraception? That was never what I was trying to do. This time, I was keeping it. I told my sister who has had two kids of her own. I haven\u2019t told her about any other times besides the first. I was keeping this one. This time, I was ready. We had already been living together for a few months, I had never been so in love, everything seemed perfect. One week later, I found out he had been cheating on me our entire relationship. My whole world came crashing down. What was I supposed to do? I felt completely betrayed and emotionally destroyed. After telling my sister, she didn\u2019t talk to me for weeks which made it even harder for me. I couldn\u2019t ever imagine if she had terminated either of her pregnancies. I would never have the perfect niece and nephew that I have today. \nI made a decision.\n\nSome days are good, some days are bad. It\u2019s not something I constantly think about, but it\u2019s not something I ever forget. I don\u2019t regret my decisions. Sometimes I think, holy shit, I could have an 8 year old right now, and that is something I cannot fathom. I\u2019m successful, I have everything I did not think I was capable of having. I\u2019ve achieved more than I ever thought I could at 18. I don\u2019t think I could have done that if I had gone through with it the first time. I know damn well I would not be the person I am today if I had. But who would I have been? What would I have done? Would it have been a boy? A girl? Would it have changed my life like every mother says it does? You can ask yourself, \u201cwhat if?\u201d all day. Nothing will change because you didn\u2019t and you don\u2019t and you are who are you right now because of the decisions you have made along the way. \n",

Once your pregancy is confirmed next week, comtact a planned parenthood or the national abortion helpline. \n\nThey deal with minors and funding issues a lot so they will be able to help you. Ibuprofen will not help you in abortion and can further really harm your body.  Imagine you accidentally overdozing and waking up in a hospital with your parents being told by a doctor (since you're a minor) that you just had a miscarriage? I don't think you want to take that chance. So just research, look for resources and ask help from professionals. Don't hurt yourself please. \n\nIf you just need to talk, feel free to DM me whenever. I (23F) just had a medical abortion via pills 2 weeks ago and still recovering so maybe I talk to you about the procedure and stuff if you wanna know? Hope everything gets better for you \u2764",

Pregnancy can be a big thing to deal with. It\u2019s one small act of biology that can suddenly become a lot more to handle in life stress. If you are not ready it\u2019s okay to get an abortion. So many of us have had abortions and we are not horrible. We .. and you, are thoughtful people with feelings who have normal lives and decided simply that this was not the right time to be pregnant. That\u2019s enough.  No other reasons needed. If you want an abortion, get one. It\u2019s okay. You are not alone.\n\nIn addition, it would seem very normal for you to struggle sorting through your trust and relationship issues right now. Your history of being unable to control or even establish your own boundaries around sex and consent could feel even more uncomfortable now. \n\nIm sorry some of the  people you work with are acting like assholes. It\u2019s not helpful in the slightest to talk about birth control or your past decision to have sex right now. Do you want their feedback anymore? It would be fine to decide you no longer want to share your personal life with them, to stop responding or even let them know you don\u2019t want to talk about it. You get to choose what\u2019s best for you right now. It\u2019s your choice to talk or not. You don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation why.\n\nI\u2019m also sorry your boyfriend is behaving distantly. Some people don\u2019t handle stress well. Some shut down to try to avoid it. It doesn\u2019t\n work well, but many seem to do it.\n\nOP, it sounds like you are thinking through your options and know what seems right. Is there more we can do to help? Do you need referrals for clinics or financial help? Do you need supportive counseling or have medical questions? We are here. You may want to close your DMs as there are thoughtless people that hide  out to try to harass folks from our sub. Just FYI. We ban them but they try to get around it by messaging directly, just heads up.\n\nMuch love to you as you find your way through this. We are here. We support you.",

To me, it seems that abortion would fall under the same laws that would allow any other kind of fatal self-defense, where the attacker dies.\n\nBefore you say that the attacker in other cases is guilty of attacking, think about our self-defense laws. Even if a person doesn't know they are causing harm to another person (like they are mentally handicap or they are too young to understand depending on their mental state or they are just literally unaware of the damage they are doing), the person being hurt is still allowed to use self-defense and if that results in the \"innocent attacker's\" (for lack of a better term) death, it's just a tragedy like any other. But it's not the equivalent of murder. This is how I see abortion.\n\nThe only way to disagree with my premise (that I've come across so far) is to try to imply some kind of guilt on a woman's part, if she consents to sex. The problem with this is that a) criminalizing sex is incredibly unhealthy for society and b) this line of thinking has been proven to lead to MORE unintended pregnancies AND abortions, regardless of whether or not they are illegal, and will do the exact opposite of what we'd all like to see (fewer abortions).",

Thus is largely because I object to the \"pro-choice\" moniker; I think the idea that the right to chose is irrelevant when it comes to the abortion debate. Rather, the question is whether or not a fetus constitutes life, or at what point human life begins.\n\nYou see, if we say that a fetus is not life, and thus entitled to no rights of its own, aborting it is fine. No big deal. You're just removing a part of your body, which is your right. The fetus is not an independent entity, and thus its destruction doesn't matter.\n\nHowever, if we say that a fetus is life, we can't kill it. Saying a fetus is human life implies that killing it is tantamount to killing an infant. This, in itself, does not invalidate a women's body rights, however we have arrived at a conflict of rights. The question becomes: what is more important? A women's right to her own body, or the right of a human life to continue living. Both are important rights, however I think the overwhelming consensus is with with the latter.\n\nImplied in this argument is that the circumstances of conception don't matter either; even if a women is raped, and becomes pregnant, if a fetus is life, she may not abort it. Surely a child conceived in rape is entitled to the same rights as any other child; he or she is not at fault for the sins of his father. If a fetus is entitled to the same rights as any other child, it can't be ethically aborted, any more than a child may be ethically killed. \n\nSo the question becomes; when does life begin? I don't know the answer, but I think any fetus with potential to live independent of the mother is certainly alive. Hence my opposition to third term abortions. Really though, this question is a study on the messiness of defining life; gestation is a messy, ambiguous process, and it is  \ncomplex.\n\nWhat I do know for certain is this: no well thought out position on this issue can be condensced to the simplistic statement of  being\"pro-life\" or pro-choice.\"",

I am so sorry you went through that and I am sending healing energy to you. \n\nAlso, it's so understandable -- how you are feeling toward your partner. Guys never experience a single reproductive situation in their own bodies -- no periods, no pregnancies, no births, no miscarriages, no abortions. They have no real clue what any of our experiences are actually like. \n\nOn top of that, it seems that many guys lack the willingness to even try to listen, understand and feel true empathy so that they can offer compassion. After reading lots of abortion stories, it is a common theme that even caring partners seem unable to provide emotional support. \n\nPlease love yourself and give yourself the compassion you deserve, and also bear in mind that it takes time for your body to regulate from all of the pregnancy hormones, which intensify emotions. Give yourself time to heal and trust that you will. Stay strong and love yourself.",

I had no reasons. \nYou're never truly ready to raise a child, there's always the risk of an abnormality, the concerns you have as reasoning why you had an abortion would still be concerns should you one day decide to go forward with a pregnancy.\nI've been with my boyfriend for over 2 years. I was on birth control. When I saw on my period tracker I was set to ovulate the day my boyfriend put his baby batter in my oven, I went to CVS and got some Plan B the next morning.\n\nStill got pregnant. With twins.  \n\nMy reason for aborting is reality. No \"the world is so cruel!\" nonsense, real time reality.  I had a baby when I was 22. No pot to piss in, I still lived with my parents but I was having this baby! I was so excited, so attached right away. Nothing could deter me. I was 22, resilient, ready to grab adversity by the balls and curb stomp it. \nThen, reality. Real, legit, real time, slap you in the face reality.  Nothing like baby sitting, not \"totes adorbs!!\"  \"Daycare is how much?!!?\"  \nNow, at 31, stable, ALLTHEPOTSTOPISSIN, I know exactly what the hardships, the frustrations, the struggles are. I know exactly what the unconditional love, the smell of freshly bathe baby, the not caring you just got shit on because, well, that part can't be explained.\nI'm not ready, I'm not willing to go through all of that again-not now. \n\nWhile I have a 9 year old daughter now, I feel like I'm finally getting time for myself again. Time to be an entity outside of nothing but a mom. While my friends were out enjoying the care free twenty's, I was home with an infant permanently attached to my boob. \n\nI deserve this time. I deserve a moment to find myself. I deserve to be able to go out and be irrational and not have to worry about being called to pick my daughter up, or not being able to go anywhere at all without her while she was still nursing. At the same time, my daughter deserves and needs to have all of me right now. I'm having a really difficult time with her at the moment, she deserves every morsel of my love and attention at this time.\n\n",

This happened in October 2018. I went to my first appt at Planned Parenthood to discuss my options at 8 weeks and went to my next to get the first pill a week later, then I was to take the second pill the next day, October 6th. I just laid down for a while until I felt the contractions start. I took the Norco they gave me but it did nothing to help my pain. I felt every single cramp and contraction and it felt like someone was stabbing me all over while simultaneously being crushed by giant boulders. My mom and boyfriend were there and there was nothing they could do to help. I cried the whole time, screaming in agony. The only thing that eased some of the pain and helped the contractions pass was to sit on the toilet. I think I sat there for hours just crying and cramping. Eventually, I felt the sac come out, I could just tell that that was it. The moment I felt it come out, it felt like my soul left my body. I felt so empty and blank and worthless. I hated myself for having to flush it, I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to reach in and get it. I got fired a week later for missing work because of it. I became so depressed and suicidal. I thought the only thing that would make me feel better would be to have another baby. I conceived December 2018 and had my daughter in August. Even though I chose to have an abortion, I feel that I was highly intimidated and convinced by family to do so. I didn\u2019t want an abortion until they drilled the idea in my head. I still resent them for it. Even though I chose to have an abortion, I still feel that i lost a child, I lost what would have been. that was my baby. I decided that that baby was real and it was a girl, we call her Angel. She would be over 1 year now. I hate myself for getting an abortion, I would never do it again. But I will always support women\u2019s choice to choose what\u2019s right for them\ud83d\udc9c",

        "body": "so, I recently came to this group for some advice. I\u2019m 18, and have an 8 month baby already and found out I was pregnant just about a week or two ago. I was literally going through the most, I hit rock bottom. I felt like I was losing my mind. I felt like humans shouldn\u2019t have to decide to end a life or bring something one into this world. I feel like we can\u2019t handle the pressure from that, well I can\u2019t at least. \nI went from abortion.. to hope the next day that I can have this baby.. to abortion again and I could not make up my mind. It was killing me inside because the reality of it, I could not do it. No matter how much hope I had I knew I wasn\u2019t ready.\n\nYesterday morning I had a miscarriage. \n\nI have been blank since the miscarriage. I don\u2019t know what to feel. But something inside is telling me this soul knew I wasn\u2019t ready and we came to an agreement. I truly feel that. \n\nI came across this article today that made me feel so peaceful inside. I will copy and paste it, i feel as if it may help others going through this.\n\n\u201cFrom a spiritual context, a miscarriage is when the baby's Spirit decides it isn't ready to come into earth yet. \nAn abortion is when the mother's Spirit decides it isn't ready to welcome a baby into earth yet.\nOne is a choice of the baby Spirit; the other is the choice of the mother's Spirit. Neither is wrong as the relationship is a mutual agreement. Both souls have free will and can choose to depart at any time. \nEach soul that enters this world has a mission, and for some, that mission can be to bring out preferences, awarenesses, or awakening in some. \nWhen a soul comes forward and aborts itself, through a miscarriage, this can stimulate a health awakening or a spiritual awakening. \n\nThey can benefit the mental and emotional capacities of both parents, creating a better relationship environment for the next soul to come through.\n\nSo on some levels, the spiritual reason for a miscarriage or abortion can act as a catalyst for one or both parents to wake up some part of their life. \n\nThe mother's soul may sense she isn't ready or the soul inside her is telling her she needs to realign before birth. Once the baby Spirit sees she is learning this, the soul may decide to leave on their own. \n\nA miscarriage or abortion can represent many energetic things going on that mean to foster new life, a realignment must occur. So sometimes, either is just a precipice, or a test run for an actual birth later on down the line.\nMotherhood and childhood is a mutual agreement, so both parties may knock on each other's door for years until one is ready. \nThe knocking of one can be an indication to the other, that they are now ready to come in. It can signal to you that it's time to start thinking about the possibility of it. \n\nThe possibility of new life can get us to make changes to the way we view the world, view ourselves, and view our relationships. So sometimes, if a baby Spirit does not make it to full term, it may be because the only reason it came around was to stir up these changes.\u201d [Miscarriage/ Abortion ](https://www.amandalinettemeder.com/blog/spiritual-meaning-of-miscarriage-abortion-early-term-pregnancies)\n\nIt really made me feel like everything is ok. That it\u2019s okay that these things happen. And there\u2019s a reason for everything.",

I feel deceived by the man I\u2019m in a relationship with because he explained he was infertile/had dead sperm from a surgery he had over a decade ago which involved his stomach because he\u2019d been shot. He said the doctor explained to him he had a .0003% chance of having a child. When I asked him several times if I should get a plan b after unprotected sex he would get angry and ask what I don\u2019t understand about him not being able to have kids? And that it made him feel like less of a man. Well, I ended up pregnant, and I ended up having an abortion. I can\u2019t figure out why I feel differently towards him and don\u2019t feel like I wanna have sex with him like I used to before I found out he was fertile. I don\u2019t trust him anymore. I don\u2019t trust him with my body, with sex, and that\u2019s what sex is about is trust. I don\u2019t feel like I consented to having sex with a fertile man. I mean I knew what the risks were that I was taking and I know I should take responsibility for not protecting myself but I didn\u2019t sign up for having unprotected sex with a FERTILE man. In a way I feel I consented to having sex with a man who had a vasectomy since there\u2019s an even higher chance of conceiving with a vasectomy than the chance he was telling me he had. Smh.  I\u2019m not trying to play victim or not own up to my actions or irresponsibility but after the research I found I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m in a similar situation? I don\u2019t think he lied about it on purpose but I think he was careless in steering me in the wrong direction and getting mad when I wanted to take extra precautions to protect myself like a plan B. How could you just put all your eggs in one basket and run with what the doctor told you and bank on that as a form of birth control. Ugh it\u2019s just frustrating because I love and have feelings for this man but I feel deceived. He insists that he wasn\u2019t fertile and finally he asked me \u201cif I took a fertility test (because that\u2019s what I\u2019m starting to feel like doing to prove to you) and the doctor says I still have a low chance of conceiving.... HOW ARE YOU going to make me feel better about the situation? To know I had a 1/1 million chance of having this baby that we terminated.\u201d (We had an abortion because we both talked about how we don\u2019t want children right now if ever, but how he knows he\u2019s fertile now and can conceive in the future if he wants.)

        "body": "I'm going to share my experience with the abortion pill because I need to let it out somewhere, and I hope this is useful to anybody that is considering a medical abortion. I was 8 weeks along when I found out that I was pregnant, and 9 weeks when I had the abortion. Warning: this is going to be very explicit and nasty. I'm not sugarcoating shit.\n\nI took the first pill (mifepristone) at the clinic. They watched me take it and gave me the other pills to take at home 24-48 hours later. I did not feel any side effects from this pill, no bleeding, cramping or nausea, it was a smooth day for me. They gave me 4 of the misoprostol pills to insert vaginally at home (they said I had to do it this way because I was more than 8.5 weeks). They also prescribed me some Norcos in case it was painful and instructed me to take 800mg of ibruprofen and eat an hour before taking the pills.\n\nAfter work the following day, I ate a sandwhich approximately 24 hours after taking the first pill. I also took 800mg of ibruprofen as instructed. I got everything ready to take the second set of pills as I knew it was going to be a long, painful process. I laid out towels on my bed, put my favorite TV show on, warmed up my heating pad, bought a big old box of maxi pads, and made sure my hair was up and I was in comfy clothes.\n\nWhen the time came, I inserted the 4 pills into my vagina with an injector thingy (not sure what it is called lol). I laid down for 30 minutes as instructed to make sure the pills fall into place. An hour went by and I felt nothing, I was getting pretty worried. After it had been 90 minutes, I got out of bed to get some water. This is when it started. I started to feel the worst cramps I had ever felt in my life. I'm talking roll into a ball, toe-curling cramps. However, I could not sit still. I felt like something was going to come out so I sat on the toilet. Instantly, blood clots the size of a bouncy ball started falling out of my vagina. These were not painful to pass, but I should not have looked because there was  A LOT of blood. I sat on the toilet for about 30 minutes while passing clots. I went back to my room and laid back down, put my heating pad on my stomach, and all was well for about 5 minutes.\n\nThe pain grew unbearable so I took a Norco. I threw this up instantly. I'm not talking just puking, this was the worst experience I have ever had with throwing up.  I could feel it coming from my gut and could not stop for a straight 5 minutes. I felt really gross afterwards, and while doing this I managed to soak through a nighttime maxi pad. I hopped in the shower because of how nasty I felt. The hot water really helped to manage my cramping pains. I stood there for about 10 minutes and it was really relaxing. However, as soon as I got out I started bleeding and throwing up again.\n\nOn top of all of that, I have severe back pain issues from an accident I had when I was young. I always have the worst back pain during menstrual cramps, but never like this. \n\nI laid back down in bed, which only lasted for about 5 minutes again. I had to sit back on the toilet for about 15-20 minutes once again passing clots, getting increasingly larger in size. The cramps intensified and I drank some Gatorade because I heard that it helps. Instantly threw that up too. I was in so much pain and at this point, about 4 hours in, I could not take it anymore so I took 4 big hits from my bong. I laid back down and actually ended up falling asleep for about an hour.\n\nI woke up to more cramping pain, soaked through another pad, and took another shower. I sat back on the toilet afterwards because I was cramping really bad and figured there were more clots. However, I really needed to puke again. I could feel it coming up my throat as I was sitting on the toilet so I had to quickly change positions and squat by the toilet to puke.\n\nThis is where it gets really fucking nasty...\n\nAs I was squatting over the toilet and retching and throwing up from the pit of my stomach, I felt something slip out of my naked vagina. Without looking down, I instantly knew this was my baby... After I got done throwing up, I looked down and threw up again. It was the size of an apple.  Then I sat on the floor and balled my eyes out for about 20 minutes straight. Although I could not distinguish all of the parts, I could tell what it was. I felt guilty, hopeless, alone, disgusting, and just really fucking sad.\n\nI tried to pick it up with toilet paper but it was too big.. I had to scoop it up and flush it down the toilet. Afterwards, I bled even more than before. I mean, blood fucking everywhere. The clots were more frequent and bigger in size. I took another shower, put a fresh pair of underwear and pad on, and laid back down. After about 30 minutes, I could tell I soaked through the pad.  I  stood up, and instantly a shit ton of blood leaked through the pad and through my underwear. I had to take it off in the shower as to not get blood everywhere because it was just pouring out of me. Over the course of the next 2-3 hours, I soaked through 4 pads and was feeling very light  headed. I got no sleep.\n\nI'm currently at work right now, I know I shouldn't be but I am. I still have fucking gut wrenching cramps and am bleeding a shit ton. I thought this was supposed to go away after I \"passed the pregnancy\" but it didn't.\n\nI feel horrible, physically and mentally. I know I did the right thing and that this was the best choice for me, but I never imagined I would feel this much sadness and guilt. I was told I would be relieved after it was over, but I feel worse than before....",

I am not a medical professional in any way, so I\u2019m going to try to avoid giving you any strictly medical advice. What I will say is that if you do attempt to fake a miscarriage, there\u2019s a chance your family takes you to the hospital, where they would be able to prove that you had lied. Even if faking it does work, it would then be extremely difficult to hide a pregnancy while living in the same home, and if your family found out you had lied about the miscarriage, their reaction would probably be pretty horrible.\n\nLastly, you mention that a friend\u2019s mother told you about how terrible abortion is and how you never want to do it, so I did want to check in and make sure you want to have the baby because you truly want to be a mother and all that that entails, and not because you\u2019re afraid of the abortion. \n\nAs much as I wish this were different, you won\u2019t have support from your parents if you have this baby. As a seventeen year old girl, that is a very difficult path to go down. It\u2019s possible, but it presents infinite hardships and is truly life changing.\n\nMy point is that I am begging you to think very carefully about what you do here, and gently reminding you that having a baby because you were afraid of an abortion is not a good reason to have a baby. With that said, the decision is yours. I wish you (and possibly your baby too, if you end up having him/her), the best possible luck!",

              "body": "First, it's wrong for your parents to pressure you in this way. This is your decision. However, I think you need to think long, and hard about what decision you should make. There's no faking a miscarriage, and continuing to hide your pregnancy. Why? Because I'm pretty sure your parents would be checking to make sure that's what occurred, and you need prenatal care. You can't just hide your pregnancy, and think you can carry to term without regular checkups. Do you think that would be the responsible thing to do?\n\nI know Pregnancy is quite glamorized when it's talked about, but it's dangerous. Especially for you, because you're a minor. We can't tell you what choice to make, but we can tell you to seek medical care. You will need prenatal care. Reliable transportation. A place to live. I don't know when you turn 18, but if it's before, or immediately after you potentially give birth, you will need to have arrangements for where you're going to live, in case your parents continue to not offer Support. Look at your state laws. Most states it's 18, some it's 21 that they can legally kick you out.\n\nOne more thing:\n\nLook, I don't know what your friend's mother told you about abortion, but it's likely not accurate. Please don't make this decision based off misinformation. This is the most important decision you will ever make. I'm not going to sugar coat it, it will be hard. You will NEED Support. Are you mentally, and physically prepared to carry a pregnancy to term with, or without Support? Are you prepared to deal with any potential postpartum mental health issues? What are your plans for the future? Do you have a car? A job? What arrangements will you have for child care? Can you give a child all the love that it deserves? At 17-18 years old, do you think you can give them everything they need, with nothing in  return?\n\nIf you're not absolutely certain about any of the answers to those questions, you might want to think about the choice you're about to make. It's not selfish to think about your future, or your health. Sometimes being the best mother, means not becoming one if the timing is bad.\n\nThis is your decision. We support you no matter what you choose whether that's Abortion, Adoption, or Parenting. I just want you to know, that it's okay to consider your well-being. I encourage you to look at this workbook. It's helped a lot of our members on deciding what to do:\n\nhttps://www.pregnancyoptions.info/\n\nThis hotline is also helpful, and will have tons of information on all of your options:\n\nhttps://www.all-options.org/find-support/talkline/",

A in-office abortion is really the best way and make sure the clinic staff knows ahead of time as they will need to work closely with law enforcement on your behalf.\n\nYou can certainly ask for sedatives on the day of your abortion to decrease physical pain and help you to relax. \n\nYou might benefit from talking through your feelings with a therapist or counselor as there can be a lot to process.

        "body": "Hi everyone, \n\nNot sure if this is the right place to be posting. I posted two weeks ago about being stealthed and the resulting pregnancy. \n\nI know many of you asked me to focus on myself and healing. The perpetrator has since decided to tell me that he would be prepared for the legal requirements if I decided to carry the foetus to term but that he wants nothing to do with me and would communicate via a person we both know and subsequently blocked me from being able to contact him. This has made me really angry and upset because he's decided to involve people in my safe space. \n\nBecause he decided to involve people in my safe space, I decided to call a helpline to explore my options. The person on the line said that if I did decide to make a police report, they may want to collect the foetus as DNA evidence. I hadn't considered this as a possibility and I decided to call the police and enquire about the process. \n\nThe abortion process has been really difficult - I had poor rising hcg levels and because the abortion clinic couldn't see the foetus in their scans, they were unable to give me the medical abortion and had to refer me to the hospital. She suspected it would be a missed miscarriage but there was a chance of an ectopic pregnancy. I subsequently spent about 5 hours in hospital, with the possibility of admission because they weren't able to find the foetus in the initial scans and they said the risk of haemorrhage was too big for me to just go home (which would have been very difficult to explain to family who I love but can't tell about this situation). I have a medical background so the first thing I did was learn about the treatment options of an ectopic pregnancy which was **horrific** (surgical intervention or medical intervention with chemotherapy drugs) and was definitely the most stressful time of my life. \n\nThey ended up finding the foetus through a transvaginal scan and I cried hysterically when I saw the heartbeat. Because they were able to find a heartbeat, I would have to be returned to the abortion clinic because they only dealt with situations where there is no foetal heartbeat. I cried again when I learnt they couldn't do anything and I would have to wait for a 'formal scan' before being able to go through with the abortion which delayed what I hoped would have been a medical abortion a week and a half ago. \n\nI am very lucky in my country where abortion is legal and free. Due to privacy laws and being able to self-refer for an abortion, no one had asked about the circumstances of how this happened. I think a large part of me was in denial about being sexually assaulted - logically I knew I had been, but I was much more focused on being able to get rid of what was inside me. \n\nI decided that because he has taken no responsibility for what happened, how difficult the whole process has been for me, and that he involved someone within my safe space, that I would lodge a police report. They have advised that they would take the investigation as far as I would like it to - whether it goes to court, if I want them to have a discussion with him about consent, etc. At this stage I have just lodged a report and decide further down the line if I'd like to pursue it. However, because of this, the police have advised that they would like to collect the DNA for evidence.\n\nThis has made the abortion process even more complicated because if I got a medical abortion like I had planned, because the foetus is so small (less than 5mm), I'd have to be really careful about getting rid of clots/passing anything down the toilet. In addition, they'd have to post a police officer to be able to get the chain of evidence. The doctor seemed to think that the surgical option would be the easier option since they would just suction everything out and they'd liase with police about handing over the evidence. I have decided that the best way to keep my options open after all this is to go through with the surgical abortion although I'm shit scared of needles and feel very unprepared for the procedure. \n\nThe silver lining of the delayed abortion is that I've had multiple scans which showed that the foetal heartrate is actually dropping, and it seems that 100% of foetuses with a heartrate below 80 don't make it past the first trimester. It brings me a lot of peace knowing definitively that I would never have been able to carry the child to term. \n\nI'm waiting to have the surgical abortion next week and I'm feeling really worn out. There's a chance I'll miscarry because of all the gestational issues before I manage to get the surgical abortion which has also been stressful. As a joke I said to my friend that the least the perpetrator could do was pay for botox as I've probably aged 5 years from this whole experience. She seemed to be angrier than I am about what I'm going through haha. \n\nHas anyone had experiences that are even remotely similar, I'd love to hear from you, whether its the wait to have a surgical abortion, positive experiences of the surgical route, feelings of general helplessness, guilt you might go down the path to 'ruin someone's life' etc etc.",

I felt like I at least owed it to my child to see them before I terminated the pregnancy but it still haunts me that I was growing something that at that point, looked human enough to me already. You can remember the memory of your terminated pregnancy without having to haunt yourself with the details that an ultrasound would have provided. For what it\u2019s worth, I think it\u2019s better for you that you didn\u2019t see the ultrasound since you were so torn. You\u2019re not a bad person, and it\u2019s okay to feel regret/sadness/guilt too. Just work to be a better version of yourself.

I had been going back and forth with my decision since finding out about the pregnancy at 4 weeks, I think I booked and canceled twice over two months before finally going through with it. \n\nI had an intense gut feeling that I should not have the baby, even though I desperately want a baby.  My boyfriend and I have been together on and off for 8 months, the relationship was initially incredibly toxic because he had a drinking problem, but upon finding out about the pregnancy he quit drinking.  The reason we had broken up twice before is he was emotionally and verbally abusive towards me, I\u2019m still not sure why I decided to get back with him but I had a connection to him and a month later I was pregnant. \n\nI\u2019m a full time student and am barely working through covid.  Boyfriend was saying he would support me and the baby and provide for us.  The truth is, I simply could not picture relying on this man my whole life. I had a gut feeling that the relationship would not last and he would go back to his abusive ways and I\u2019d have to quit my studies and struggle to provide for the child for the rest of my life. \n\nBefore my boyfriend I was with my ex of 6 years, we had tried for but lost a baby to miscarriage at 22 weeks in 2016. Ever since then my urge to have a baby and be a mum was extreme.  Something in my head made me ignore all the realities of my situation and get pregnant because that\u2019s all I had wanted for so long.  I put my hand up and say that I am an idiot and was stupid and irrational. \n\nI held onto the pregnancy for 13 weeks because I was enjoying every moment, I would check updates of its development daily and was starting to grow a bump. But deep down I know it wasn\u2019t right, I couldn\u2019t emotionally or financially support the baby.  \n\nThe reason for my post - I am feeling such intense regret and guilt for not asking to see the ultrasound screen right before my procedure.  I had a scan at 8 weeks where the baby looked like a blob, but I knew if I saw the screen that it would look like a real tiny person this time. I wish I had a chance to keep that image in my head and say goodbye properly.  I am heartbroken. \n\nI wish I didn\u2019t hold onto the baby for so long. I feel like such a selfish person.  I don\u2019t know if I can forgive myself.",

If you have had the medications for longer than 2 years and you can get more, it's best to do so. Details below.\n\nMifepristone has a longer shelf life than misoprostol. Generic mifepristone has a shelf life of about 3 years, although manufacturers Mifeprex and Linepharma state that their mifepristone has a shelf life of 5 years.\n\nMisoprostol expires more quickly \u2014 about 2 years in blister packs (the packaging is important because the active ingredient degrades faster when exposed to humidity).\n\nWhen the pills are expired, they are less effective \u2013 so you would need more of them to have the same effect. Because it's not really feasible to calculate the remaining active ingredient and adjust the dosage on your own, you are better off getting a new package. You can dispose of the old one in a prescription medication disposal/dropoff location, many towns have them.\n\nAlso, to keep your medications effective until the end of the manufacturer-stated shelf life: don't store your pills in a place where they are exposed to heat or humidity! A bathroom cabinet may not be the best place for this reason.\n\nPossible FAQs:\n\nIt's not that the medications become unsafe when expired, but they are likely to be less effective.\n\nMisoprostol in a bottle expires faster. Not recommended to keep on hand for AP.\n\nIf you have just mifepristone but you think your misoprostol is probably expired, you can contact Aid Access and ask them to call in a misoprostol-only RX.",

And we didn\u2019t have any money.\n\nThe second was last week. I had birth control but it failed and I got pregnant again after that. The same reasonings applied but this time I felt more prepared and actually planned on keeping the baby for about a month or so. But at 8 weeks I realized that all the reasons I had before were still valid and just because my birth control failed didn\u2019t mean that it was a miracle baby or a sign it was meant to happen. I ultimately had to detach myself from any mystical outside reasoning and face the facts of biology. Sperm met egg, and pregnancy occurred. It felt natural that my instinct was to be conflicted over it. I had a desire to keep the growing embryo safe as soon as I knew. But overcoming it by going through the logical reasons worked for me. I just had to come to it on my own time.\n\nI also had to detach myself from what everyone else wanted and focus only on what I wanted. In her case, that might lead her to deciding to be a single mother. Personally, I never saw myself having kids at all and I realized I didn\u2019t want to have kids at this age either way.\n\nThe thing that comforted me the most is knowing I have a lot of years ahead of me to plan a pregnancy, find a life partner if it\u2019s not my boyfriend, finish school, get a career going, etc. She might not be worrying about those things as much because she\u2019s older and at the point in her life where she feels she can take that responsibility on. That\u2019s her choice to make.\n\nShe already finished law school, seems like she\u2019s got a good foundation for her future so I would understand if she didn\u2019t want to end that future and potential life path just to try again later. Some women think that if it happens, it\u2019s just happening for them. Not when they planned but some don\u2019t even consider abortion, because pregnancy is a little miracle. I don\u2019t see it that way because my life would\u2019ve been turned upside down in the worst way and I would\u2019ve relied on government assistance to get through my days.",

I came here a couple of years ago for support, and thought I would share my story and how I am doing today in hopes that it might help someone else.\n\nI'm sure I've laid out my story thoroughly in my post history, but I'll try to run through some bullet points;\n\n* started taking BC around December/January to control my periods.  I waited for my period before starting them, and afterwards was pleased to find my period went away almost completely.\n* several months later, I started having what seemed like IBS symptoms, and I was due for an annual checkup anyway so I went to the doctor and he ordered a bunch of tests. I told him I didn't have any reason to believe I was pregnant, but the test was free and it was just less effort to give the extra bit of blood for the test than to argue.\n* surprise, turns out I was pregnant! I was baffled and had no clue how long I could have been pregnant. I told my partner and I believe by our calculation from my last period, at max it would have been 20-22 weeks? Close to California's 24 week limit, but doable.  Covid made it difficult, but I finally scheduled an appointment with planned parenthood.\n* I go to my appointment expecting to get it over with that day... They take me back, do the ultrasound, and tell me it's at about 25 weeks(memory is foggy on exact numbers), and that even if it were a little less, they weren't equiped to do anything.  They could tell I was freaking out, and gave me info for a hospital nearby that does later term procedures than PP, saying they could give me a second opinion.\n* I went to that hospital same day.  They do an ultrasound.  They estimate the pregnancy as even further along, I believe 27-28 weeks.  They gave me info for a couple of out of state clinics that perform abortions further along.  I call to get info.\n* BLAH BLAH LOGISTICS MONEY BLAH BLAH my partner and I talked to both of our sets of parents, and luckily with their help we were able to send me to New Mexico for a week.\n* I flew to Albuquerque and got a motel room.  I linked up with an AWESOME local organization, the NMRCRC! They helped me get to my first appointments, get my prescriptions, set me up with food, and paid for most of my motel stay.  Absolutely lovely people.\n* Day 2, my partner's mom flies in to help me out.  She keeps an eye on me, drives me around, even helped when my water broke in my only sweatpants.  From the passenger seat of the rental car I smile and wave at the protesters outside the clinic.  I don't think they liked that.\n* Procedure happens over the course of the week.  Everything went well. I got to go home to my loving partner.  I'm well taken care of and my boss helps me out at work for the next couple of weeks while I recover(physical job).\n\nphew.\n\nIn any case, I wanted to come back for a few reasons.  I wanted to thank everyone on this sub for their support.  When I logged into this account there were even a few messages of support from after my last log in.  Of course, there were others too.  People asking why I did it, some politely and some not so politely.  And of course some nasty messages, luckily I find those funnier than anything.\n\nI also wanted to let everyone know that no matter how late you have your abortion... you will be okay.  I will admit, this wasn't a hard decision for me at all.  And I was extremely lucky to have a supportive partner, supportive family on both sides(both emotionally and financially), and the ability to take off work for the procedure as well as take it easy in the weeks after as I recovered.  I understand this is all very different from a lot of people that have abortions so late, and I do not want to invalidate those people or act like this is so easy for everyone else.  I just want to say... it will be okay.\n\nI worried a lot at the time that, in the future I would regret it.  That maybe I would feel bad for having such a late abortion.  But, if I had to start back at that doctors appointment, I don't think I would do any differently.  I know that I made the right choice.  In general, but most importantly for myself.\n\nI think some people may see it as shallow, but I also had fears about my love life.  I was afraid that my partner might see me differently.  I was afraid that sex wouldn't be the same.  I was scared to feel like \"used\" or \"damaged\" goods, despite knowing full well what a misogynistic concept that is.  And I'm sure there are people here who feel the same fear, and might be scared and confused by it.  Or feel wrong for it.  But, I don't think it's wrong to worry about this.  \n\nI can't tell you how your partner will feel, but if you're going through this I want you to remember: it's. not. your. problem.  That's on them if they don't support you.  Do not forget you deserve to be loved and desired and treated well.\n\nI will say sex is different.  It might have been more like before if I had done kegels, but I have never gotten around to it and...it's different, but really not that much, and it's certainly not bad.  I will say it has taken a while to rediscover my sex drive, but it's still there.  I still enjoy it.  My partner still enjoys it.  It seems like common sense that after birth the vagina doesn't get permanently stretched out.  But it's still a relief to know from experience.\n\nSince a lot of people have asked, I will share my rationale for my decision.  Besides the fact that, simply, this is how I wanted to handle it(and that should honestly be reason enough)... While it was an easy choice for me, I did consider the ethics of it.  I considered my options.  \n\nI certainly wasn't going to raise it, for a lot of reasons - not enough income, mental health issues, my partner was honest in that while they would not argue child support, they would not stay with me and would want nothing to do with the child, and if I wasn't prepared emotionally or financially for a child as a couple, I certainly wasn't prepared to be a single parent.\n\nAdoption was on the table of course, but I had issues with that too.  I didn't want to carry the pregnancy any further than I had to.  I didn't want to have a c-section(it seems you can ask for a c section early, and I worry that a c section would have been more likely at full term).  I'm not sure it's rational, but at the time I felt paranoid about the evolving genetic technology, and the idea of there being a person out there with my DNA that can sell or give away their genetic information without my consent or knowledge.  I don't want to have to think about what is going on with said person.  I don't want to be contacted at some random date in the future to be asked about my life by an essential stranger, and to feel obligated to give said info.\n\nOn top of that is of course concerns for the quality of life of the child.  I couldn't be sure it would go to a happy and stable home, and learn what I see as good values and manners.  Both my partner and I have family history of many inheritable conditions, both mental health and physical health.  I also didn't know I was pregnant, so I didn't treat myself like I was pregnant!  I drank.  I smoked weed and the ocassional cigarette.  I took medications that were not ideal to take while pregnant.  I got up to mischief and rowdy shit with my friends.  I worked a physical job, often lifting packages 70-100 lbs and walking all up and down a 6 storey building.  I also lost weight very quickly during most of the pregnancy via crash dieting.  I tried to get veggies and good protein like tofu, chicken, and fish in my diet, but there were many days where I was eating 800 calories or less(and I am over 5'5\").  I didn't ask about the health of the pregnancy aside from how it affected my own health, since it wouldn't have been enough to sway my decision, but I am not sure it would have come out in great health.\n\nIn any case.  No matter what, I am happy I went through with it. I can't say I feel comfortable enough to be open with people who know things like my name and face, but I am content with what happened.  My partner and I joke about my positive K/D ratio.  My mind and body are healthy.  It's not something I think about often, and when I do it's mostly about how frustrated I am that I can't get my hair to look as good as it did in those few months.\n\nI'm going to try and log into this account periodically again, so if anyone has any questions or just needs to talk, please feel free to ask!  I'll try to keep on top of my DMs too.\n\nOne last thing I'd like to share for anyone in the same circumstance: If you are late enough that labor has to be induced... Be prepared for your water breaking.  On TV it always look like someone spilled a water bottle out their pants......... It's so much worse.  There is blood.  And the fluids do not stop coming.  You do NOT want to be surprised by the sheer amount of red and pink fluids.  Make sure wherever you're staying has a decent shower you can sit in for a bit when that happens, if you don't go to the clinic immediately.\n\n(Also, the sprite and ritz crackers post delivery are going to be the most delicious and refreshing things you will ever experience)\n\n(much love and please consider donating to the NMRCRC if you have the opportunity)",

There are natural sources, but I recommend just getting the little orange tablets. Other early methods are soaking in SUPER hot baths. Sustaining heavy blows to the  lower stomach reason can cause a miscarriage, but I don't know if id recommend going around hitting yourself in the gut.\n\nAt this point, I would suggest calling in favors. The abortion procedure gets more expensive as you go, so just get it done asap. Call everyone that you know and trust and ask for small sums of money. Factor in your insurance. Discuss your position with the planned parenthood clinic. Do what you need to. Vitamin C and hot baths won't help now,a s they induce abortion by starting your period, which you won't be able to do this far along. \n\nTry a gofundme account. You have to be honest, so if this is a secret abortion, it may not work. But hey, give it a try. Good luck, fellow female in distress",

If worse comes to worse and she does have the baby I would not be able to live happily knowing I have a kid that is mine out there and have nothing to do with them. I don't know how true that will hold on her end especially since she has now got her mother involved. I don't even care about that though I just cannot live with her having a child of mine. I need to convince her to abort some how some way. I believe I will need to point out all these negative things going on in her life and maybe she will realize that this is not a wise decision",

One scary thing I would like to mention is that she has already begun saying things such as \"he's just hungry\" \"I want him\" \"i don't care he's mine\". She has had a previous accidental pregnancy (not with me) in which she planned to go through with that led to a miscarriage which I believe is the reason for her craziness pertaining to the pregnancy. I don't want her to get kicked out of her home so in the event that she decides to go through with an abortion how should she explain that to her parents?",

Does she trust her mother to watch her child? Is there anyone in her household that would be around to watch them?  How will that effect her relationships with them?  How will she afford child care?\n\nWho will pay for diapers, baby food.  Does she want to breast feed? How will she manage that and still work (breast pumps are not cheap).  Who will pay the hospital bills?  What if she needs a C section?  Can she afford to be in the hospital for days, and have physical restrictions for weeks after delivery?\n\nHow will she afford her living expenses?  Does she want to be stuck at her parents house forever?  Does she want to try to raise a helpless child in an abusive household with no permanent partner?\nDoes she have a car?  Does it have child seat attachment points?  How will she afford a child seat or stroller?  Hospitals will not allow an infant to leave unless they are properly secured into an appropriate carrier.\n\nIt does sound like she is hoping to gain support from someone by having this child.  Maybe she thinks it will keep you around, make you feel responsible for taking care of her.  I would shy away from directly saying that you don't want anything to do with her or the baby (if that is the case) as this could trigger her to make a desperate decision that she thinks will get her what she needs/wants.  Instead, state the facts: you are leaving to go to grad school.  You don't want a child.\n\nHopefully you can flood her with doubt about having a child and being able to give it the life it deserves.  What is best for this child?",

I realized that it would be wrong to try and force her to have an abortion I agree with that statement. As the situation has progressed I have never done anything even remotely close. I do believe I have a moral right to be a realist looking at both of our lives and point out the difficulties of bringing a child into this world neither of us are ready for her and the hardships that come with it which is what I have done. Just the same as she can do whatever she wants since it is her body and she could abort even if I wanted to keep the child. I do not believe I have done nothing wrong. I have been nothing but polite, kind and reasonable in my talks with her. She on the other hand has been very rude, insulting, and has even threatened me. At the moment she is about 6 weeks and still wants to keep the baby. I have been respectful of her decision and have been trying to be supportive although I want nothing to do with her personally seeing as how she has shown her true colors in this situation and has turned out to be very mean and disrespectful. I think the worst part out of all of this is the fact that this pregnancy forces me to be involved with her crazy ass and her crazy life & family for the rest of my life. I still hope she changes her mind on continuing with the pregnancy as the challenges that will come with it are far greater than either of us can deal with right now. I know abortion is awful and not an easy thing to do let alone even talk about but I just feel that it is for the best. \n\nI appreciate y'alls input",

That is a decision that is 100% hers and hers alone. You can tell her where you stand on the issue. You don't want to be a father, you are about to start grad school and if she has the baby, you won't be involved and child support will be minimal, at least until you finish your education. That's really all the input you get here. You aren't in a relationship with this girl and you don't get to try and sway her decision. That is coercion and it's wrong. Here's the thing about being pro-choice, I will always support a woman's right to have an abortion if that's what she wants, but I will also support a woman's right to choose NOT to have an abortion if that's what she wants. You made your decision when you had unprotected sex with her, now the decision is in HER hands.\n\nThat said, it doesn't sound like she is even remotely prepared to be a parent. Your best bet is to tell her where you stand and leave it at that. Quit talking to her. If you keep talking to her, even if you aren't saying what she wants to hear, you are giving her hope that you will be around. Maybe if she sees that she will really be alone in this, she may feel differently about continuing the pregnancy.\n\nIf she does continue the pregnancy, don't do anything without a court ordered paternity test. If she wants to file a petition for child support, or she or the child receives any kind of government assistance, you WILL be ordered to pay child support, so it's better to be prepared for that possibility now. But for the time being, your biggest concern should be is she really pregnant and if so, is it yours. Until you know the answers to these questions, there's nothing more for you to do other than to quit trying to force her into having an abortion, because that just makes you an asshole.",

        "body": "I have been talking to this girl for a few months. She is 20 years old and I am about to turn 25 years old. I still live with my parents and am about to start graduate school in February. She lives with hers as well and is a high school graduate working full time at a gym front desk. Things have been fairly causal between us. I did meet her family very early on who were all nice to me but around that time I told her that things were moving too fast and she was upset but understood. She wanted to remain friends but she also wanted to continue having sex because she said that she doesn't trust anyone else to have sex with her and that I am the best she has ever had. Not trying to brag or anything but that is literally the things she told me. For whatever reason I continued to see her and have sex with her. The first few times I ever had sex with her I used a condom but after that she would complain about the condom saying that she doesn't enjoy having sex with a condom and they irritate her vagina. I did not like the fact that she didn't want me to use a condom but I continued to have sex with her several times after this. I even tried different kinds of condoms to see if there was one that was acceptable but was never able to find one. I obviously know that pulling out is not an extremely safe method to prevent pregnancy but I have never had any issues before when having unprotected sex. We have used Plan B on 2 occasions including the very last time I had unprotected sex with her(and that was also the very last time I had sex with her period). Now she has admitted to me that she is 99% sure she is pregnant and refuses to abort. I am no where near being ready to be a parent nor do I want to be involved with this girl or her family for the rest of my life. Not to mention if my parents were to find out I don't know what will happen to me because they are very strict when it comes to stuff like that. I honestly don't even know if my parents know that I have sex. she has also admitted to me that she has unintentionally \"fallen\" for me throughout this whole thing. In my time knowing the girl i have learned a number of things. she is involved in some bad stuff. She has sold weed and is involved with some bad people including some in prison. She herself is not a bad person but in my opinion and experience with her she is crazy. Her family is awful to her. She lives with her biological mom and stepdad who have 2 kids of their own so she has two half siblings. She also has a brother who shares the same mother and father (who has been in and out of prison and I'm not sure if he currently is or not) as her who also lived with them. She has expressed to me on many occasions how her mom still beats her whenever she is even just mildly irritated with her and she is often out casted by her family and left out of things and activities they do. There was even an incident in which she got into an argument with her parents, threatened to kill herself, the police were called, and she was admitted into a mental institution for a very brief amount of time. Not even a week. She has told me she was molested by one of her uncle's when she was very young and has told almost nobody and definitely no one in her family. Her mom and stepdad both cheat on each other which is just another horrible aspect of their family. Am I horrible for not wanting to bring a life into this world that has to come into all that chaos on top of the fact that I am not ready for parenthood? She has now admitted to me that she told her mom who is apparently very supportive and excited which means my chances of convincing her to have an abortion are slim to none. Like I said I am not ready at all to be a parent nor do I want to have any type of offspring with this girl and her crazy life and family. She told me her mom and stepdad would be very upset if she ever got an abortion and might potentially kick her out  seeing as they are very religious. I am literally freaking out at this point and do not know what do to do at all. Does anyone have any helpful opinions or advice for me? I know that I have no one else to blame but myself for this situation. I should've known she was bad news from the beginning but here I am now going crazy over this horrible predicament I am in. Any and all serious advice is welcome.",

When my BC pills failed, I didn't know I was pregnant until I was 11 weeks along. I did everything I was supposed to and still ended up pregnant. I was actively trying not to get pregnant, and it still happened! Abortion needs to be an option until birth control can be 100% effective. I could not have carried that pregnancy to term - abortion was my only option. And thankfully my abortion was hassle free. I made an appointment, went, and then it was over. And it cost me $70. It should be that easy for everyone. Everyone should have that right.\n\nIt's not like it was an easy decision for me, or even easy to come to terms with afterwards. I'm mad that I was forced into that position, and mad that I had to make a decision like that. But you know what? I'm happy I did it, and I'm happy I had that option! \n\nWhy can't people understand that we're not going out and having abortions for fun! And even if we are, why should it matter to any one else?

Allow yourself the time and grace to heal. You deserve so much better and I hope you find it! Again, you are NOT a bad person for choosing what was best for you at the time. There are also so many hormones flying around inside that make it very difficult to recover emotionally after what you went through. For the first week I wondered if I would ever stop feeling depressed and wanting my baby back, but after the crazy hormones settled down I felt so much better about my decision and was able to move on.

She was looking at bringing another unwanted child into a toxic relationship and the near impossible task of being a single mom to three eventually. She felt like she had no choice but to hide the abortion because she knew you would block her from her right, be unsupportive, and bully her into a pregnancy she did not want. You showed her the first time she wanted to abort that she could not trust you to respect her. You don't get to demand a woman gestates a pregnancy agianst her will for you. Even if it makes you feel sad and betrayed. Only the woman decides if she takes a pregnancy to term because of the physical and emotional risks to her body. It's her body even if it's your kid.\n\nAs for your family of course they still have a relationship with the mother of thier grandchild. She didn't betray them. She's the mother. A good relationship with her is needed to have access to thier grandchildren. She is, weather you like it or not, your families family because she has thier grandkids. She carried thier blood in her body. She is raising thier blood too. They probably don't hold an abortion agianst her. She is thier family now if you agree or not thru the children. It's not a competition. Asking your parents to be cut off from thier grandkids is unreasonable. \n\nI think you really need to step outside of yourself here and try to put yourself in the others shoes. Your parents have a right to a relationship with thier grandkids and thier mother outside of you. Your girlfriend had a right to choose not to remain pregnant in a failed relationship as a single mom. Shes allowed to decide this was not a good place to bring a new life into. Shes allowed to decide she wants no more kids and doesn't want to endure the burden and pain of another pregnancy. She's allowed to decide she can't handle being a single mom to three. These are decisions shes allowed to make for herself. \n\nI think the other posters are right that you need some therapy and have some control issues. You need to let go of this anger for the sake of your living children and your co parenting relationship. Maybe think about birth control options for yourself so you don't have to go thru this agian.",

So my baby mother that I have two kids with and bought a house in sept with a long story short our relationship was not the best. Anyway fast forward she has an abortion and hides it from me. I find out By reading her phone and we are currently not dating I guess, but living in the same house. (she's talking to the old ppl she used to talk to as well). It bothers me but not too much I know my end goal. I'm really just hurt about till this day and it happened in December. I don't want to sound like a whiny baby, but I really feel like it's affecting me and I haven't really talked to anyone close about it. I didn't even care if we weren't going to be together I never believed in abortion and I felt like one of my kids died I know I sound crazy but that's how I feel cuz I remember we wanted to have abortions for both my kids well she wanted to for the 2nd and I said hell no and she never did it. You know what makes me sad and hurt the most I mean me and my family are close. at least I thought I was. But my sisters and mothers really just been being weird. what I mean by that is for the most part they still engage and talk to her as if I and her still go out. and I won't lie IT FUCKING BOTHERS ME a lot. yes, I know she's the mother of my child but they wanted to fly her out to NYC for Mother day. i live here in Florida. I know ima sound so selfish saying this but I'm like YALL ARE MY FAMILY THIS GIRL HAD AN ABORTION AND DIDNT TELL ME AND NOT ONLY THAT SHE WAS DOING SHIT BEHIND MY BACK. HOW CAN Y'ALL SIT HERE AND WANT TO EVEN DO THINGS FOR HER AND EVEN STILL ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION WITH HER EVERY DAY. NOW I'm not saying they shouldn't talk but it's like it actually gives me anxiety and I lowkey feel betrayed. I know I probably sound so crazy writing this. . It hurts no one close to me really asked me and talked to me about my feelings or check on my feelings about the abortion. but everyone is cool with her and everything is fine and dandy. am I too selfish? am I jealous? I don't even talk to my family no more because it's like FUCK YOU. She's done me wrong and yall really sitting here talking to her like yall best friends. I feel like a family should stick together and they don't get it .. PLEASE I BEG SOMEONE PLEASE GIVE ME ADVICE",

The energy was crazy so I couldn't stay away even though I felt I was wasting my time ...emotionally our link ups always grew me but they were also draining because I felt I couldn't just be. I felt I had to suppress myself as not to overwhelm him or push him away. A lot of the energy was sexual as it usually is in the begging when two people find each other attractive. It didn't help that we worked well together and had so much to talk about. ( \n\nI honestly never thought we would get to a point where we even had a chance to try being in a relationship because he literally just stopped communicating with me last year. This year he returned, having had all the experiences he felt he needed to know who he was sexually and overall. He admitted he was bisexual and didn't think I would give him a chance if he came clean about it. I'd always had an inkling...I'd really always known that was probably the case and it didn't bother me because I classify myself as fluid.\n\nDuring our time apart I grew close to a couple who introduced me to being in an open lifestyle. I realized ultimately that when I felt safe I was more open to more. Long story short, when this guy came back into my life he came back full force. He was open, he was consistent and he was being so forthcoming with his feelings and his process. I was the closed one this time around. I didn't think he would accept me if he knew about this couple because he made it very clear that he was not interested in any outside relations or inviting anyone into our bond.\n\nHaving had almost two years of more superficial interactions where I felt I had to hold myself back as not to scare him off it was a breath of fresh air to be experiencing him being so open. We've loved each other as friends for years at this point but for me it was still not as deep because I expected him to do what he always did and run away. Fast forward to three months in and COVID hits. We are of course Quarantined together between our places. The love is growing, we are talking about all the things but I don't feel comfortable telling him who I have had relations with because they are a part of my friend group. In LA thats basically your family so as he was coming back into my life he was also coming into theirs. He'd attempted to form a relationship with them as they live next door to me.\n\nWe have sex for the first time and get pregnant. \n\nI tell him who the couple was that I'd told him about before so he could know and decided if he is ok with being around them knowing we've had sex. He says he does not accept that. I say I don't think its smart to have a baby now, we have not had the time to build a solid enough foundation to bring the child into. He tells me he will not be with me if I have an abortion. \n\nMy family rallied to my aid to show support. My friends are like girl don't be silly, you know better than to have the baby because he wants it. I tried to give it time to see if we could make it work...but ultimately I come back to a feeling that I am having the baby because he wants it not because I feel comfortable and ready or even excited about it. I ultimately feel stuck because I do want to be with this man but I don't want to have to have a baby to make that happen.",

The abortion nearly killed me, as the young doctor -- whose English was very limited -- chose the wrong procedure.\n\nBoyfriend was an alcoholic drug addict who was sent to prison less than a month after getting me pregnant. I discovered he had FIVE OTHER CHILDREN by five different women, and was evading child support for every one of them! He was also violent, and hit my two-year-old!\n\nI chose abortion because I knew my limits. You probably chose that option for the same reason.\n\nGentle hugs to you, dear.

I have been where you are, and now I find myself in the same position again - having to make an incredibly heartbreaking and difficult decision - but one that is in essence more life giving to myself than any decision I have made in the past and possibly ever in the future. It\u2019s okay to feel sad, and it\u2019s okay to grieve the death of a child that you chose to not have. But sister I plead with you to hear me when I say, you made the decision for a reason - whatever that may have been - there was something within you that told you - no. This is not the right time. Try and keep hold of that reason, and remind yourself that your instinct is never wrong - you would not have aborted if it was truly the wrong decision for you as well as the little life inside of you. \n\nI remember during my first abortion, a prayer I repeated over and over again was: \n\nbless you, rahamaima, compassionate Nurterer of life, who helps us choose life. \n\nWhen we abort, we choose life for ourselves, as well as for the creation in our womb space oftentimes. Take responsibility for your power - for your right and opportunity to choose life. \n\nWhen we abort, we come to embody the life death life nature. What this means is that rebirth will come to all that has died. and it may not be in the form of a baby - but it may be in your ability to continue to be - whether that be reaching life goals that you wouldn\u2019t be able to meet if you had a baby; or being able to survive financially which would not have been possible otherwise ect.\n\nMy heart is with you. Know that I along with many other woman have felt your pain, and that we too felt that there was no way through it - yet here we are. The pain will pass, and with that a new found understanding of your circumstances will be birthed as well. \n\nFull power to each and everyone of us who has chosen LIFE. I know that I would make the decision a thousand times over - and I know that this decision is  not only in the interest of myself, but in the interest of a child - there is no use giving life to lives that are not worth living.",

The 1st attempt we didn\u2019t consume any alcohol. The 2nd time we thought it wouldn\u2019t be so easy and quick to conceive. \n\nBack of our minds we thought conceiving would be difficult and take several attempts. However we were naive to drink around this time.\n\nWe were not binge drinking but unfortunately the past 2 weeks we consistently consumed quite a bit of wine due to festivities.\n\nWe usually abstain from alcohol and are not wine drinkers but we frequently visited Christmas Markets and went out for many dinners with drinks the past 2-3 weeks. \n\nAlmost each night we each consumed about 2-3 glasses of wine. When calculating 150ml / 5 oz per glass.\n\nIf her ovulation and fertilization occurred on day 14, for the next 10 out of 20 days, at least 2-3 glasses of wine up to a maximum of 4 glasses of wine were consumed during a dinner out.\n\nI calculated that over 20 days, a total of 25 glasses of wine were consumed by my girlfriend or approx. the equivalent amount of 5 full bottles of wine total for the entire period.\n\nWhen put this way, it sounds alarming and like a lot for one person..\n\nEven just a few glasses of wine would have left us worried but it was much more than this when added up all together.\n\nOf course now that we know she is pregnant, we feel extremely silly, irresponsible and unlucky that any alcohol was consumed during this time.\n\nHealth:\n\nMy girlfriend and I are now of course deeply worried about the health of our baby and worried that we exposed our baby to a lot of harm during a critical development phase.\n\nLooking online there are a lot of resources that say the first trimester and especially the first few weeks after ovulation and fertilization is a vulnerable time when lots of development takes place. Especially during week 2-4 after fertilization. The weeks we consumed drinks..\n\nWe always wanted a child but never expected it to happen this quickly and under these particular circumstances. \n\nWe both also had little idea that a critical development phase could happen so early and quickly.\n\nAfter discovering the positive result, we both learned a lot about the pregnancy stages.\n\nMy girlfriend is deeply worried, feeling distressed and sad that we might have caused irreversible damage to the fetus.\n\nWe know too much alcohol was consumed for a safe pregnancy. We cannot change the past and she will obviously stop consuming any alcohol but there is now the unknown.\n\nTill the day of the child\u2019s birth and for possibly a few years thereafter, I am worried that my girlfriend will continue to feel guilt, regret and paranoia that the alcohol consumption did not give our child the best opportunity for health.\n\nWe are worried the baby will not develop fully healthy, possibly have Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and defects.\n\nI am trying my best to assure her that everything will be ok and that we at least didn\u2019t binge drink or feel drunk once. Only on 2 occasions did we feel a little tipsy.\n\nSome sources say that the fetus is not exposed to any alcohol during this time, that the fetus is living off of the yolk sac and that the placenta and umbilical chord is not developed yet to share any blood with the mother and thus any alcohol.\n\nHowever, there are also a lot of other sources saying otherwise and I think the placenta surely is already forming, providing nutrients and blood flow from the mother to the fetus during this time.\n\nEven if there is a safe window of 2 weeks after fertilization, we each had about 3 drinks each day after this time on days 29, 30 and 31. A total amount of at least a bottle of wine over these 3 days.\n\nDay 32 and 33 we stopped drinking and on day 34 we had a positive test indicating 2-3 weeks pregnant.\n\nAbortion:\n\nWe previously would never had considered an abortion but now too our despair, it is a consideration due to the alcohol circumstances.\n\nWe are in a dilemma and worried we have caused damage to the baby. \n\nLife is so fragile and all stages of pregnancy are important but the early stages are especially susceptible to harm and critical for healthy development where the heart, central nervous system, eyes, limbs and facial features are already developing.\n\nPro Abortion:\n\nWhen considering the situation overall, terminating might now be an option for us. Of course this will be an extremely difficult decision to make but we are thinking long term.\n\nIn this situation, we will have learned our lesson and minimize risk in the future. \n\nWhen we try again, we will not consume any alcohol and be more careful and strict about our planning.\n\nThis would provide peace of mind that we did our best to do things right from the very beginning for the baby\u2019s health.\n\nPro Life:\n\nIf we proceed with the abortion, we will wonder what if the baby was perfectly fine and that the odds of the alcohol affecting the baby were slim to none.\n\nThat humans and their cells are robust and can fight off toxic and teratogenic effects even at the embryonic phase.\n\nThat the risk of alcohol affecting the baby would be low unless someone drank consistently a glass of wine for several weeks or months while pregnant.\n\nSummary:\n\nEither decision, it does not provide the best peace of mind to my girlfriend.. both decisions will generate feelings of regret.\n\nMy girlfriend is worrying a lot and having a lot of tears. I am trying my best to console her and be supportive so that she worries less. I guess since it\u2019s fresh, it will take some time to settle the negative thoughts.\n\nMeanwhile I wish there were more clear conclusive studies, exposure timelines and odds shared for situations like this so we can make our best informed decision. Some studies say critical from week 4, others from week 6 or 8. It is confusing.\n\nOverall, we are hoping for the best and to keep the baby.\n\nWe will be visiting a doctor next week and I hope to get more advice. Till then I hope to hear some of your thoughts. I would be grateful to hear your experiences.",

This would put me at 4 weeks approx (does this even matter?) \n\nThis is exactly correct.  Apparently you have a textbook menstrual cycle, and you ovulated two weeks after your period.\n\nMost pregnancy dating uses what's called \"LMP (last menstrual period) dating,\" which starts at 2 weeks.  The day you get pregnant, you're two weeks pregnant.\n\nThis is an artifact of how pregnancies were dated before we had ultrasounds.\n\n> \u201cWhether or not you are a candidate for surgical abortion and/or sedation will be determined by the doctor you see on the day of your appointment.\u201d Does this mean I need to go first for a \u201cscreening\u201d type of situation and then they schedule another appointment for the actual procedure? If I\u2019m not having the procedure on that day then I would rather not miss class and go at a different time.\n\nI can't say what they do exactly, but I'm guessing that it's the same day.  That's how I would do it if I were them.  NY has no mandatory waiting period, so why spend more time, y'know?\n\nI think the deal with whether or not you're a candidate has more to do with stuff like, can they see the pregnancy on ultrasound to confirm it's in your uterus?  Do you have medical conditions that would make it unsafe for them to take care of you?  Stuff like that.\n\n> I tried calling them but the wait time is more than 60 min.\n\nBummer.  PP can be a bit of an assembly-line.  They do a lot to make this available to women, but that means getting through patients efficiently.\n\n> I prefer to be in a controlled environment and \u201cget it over with.\u201d\n\nMe too.",

        "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve been going through the posts since yesterday night. I took two pregnancy tests and they both came out positive (obviously, why else would I be here?). Now, I was pretty certain from the start that I wanted to get an abortion, however I didn\u2019t have all the info regarding medical vs. surgical. I just assumed that taking the pills was \u201cthe norm,\u201d as the thought of \u201csurgical\u201d made me really scared. Just for reference, I\u2019m 26.\n\nThis morning I called the local PP and I made an appointment for next Monday to have a medical abortion. The lady calculated that I was 6 weeks along using my last period date. However, I know exactly when I conceived since I hadn\u2019t had sex for three months before that (when I\u2019m certain I conceived) and I haven\u2019t had sex ever since. This would put me at 4 weeks approx (does this even matter?) \n\nAnyway, as soon as I booked the appointment, I was relieved I would get it over with relatively soon until I started to question my decision of choosing pills over surgical. After much consideration and reading stories/doing a little bit of research, I\u2019m leaning towards surgical. I called the local PP again but they said the only place in the state (NJ) that is closest to me where they do surgical is about 40 miles from where I live (too far + no one will want to drive me there and back). I decided to book an appointment in NYC instead. \n\nThe next available appointment that somewhat accommodates my schedule is for Feb 19, so I took it. After I booked the appointment, I read that \u201cWhether or not you are a candidate for surgical abortion and/or sedation will be determined by the doctor you see on the day of your appointment.\u201d Does this mean I need to go first for a \u201cscreening\u201d type of situation and then they schedule another appointment for the actual procedure? If I\u2019m not having the procedure on that day then I would rather not miss class and go at a different time. Has anyone had any experience with PPNYC? I tried calling them but the wait time is more than 60 min. Am I going on Feb 19 just for a screening or is there a possibility that I will get the procedure done that day? These are important things, as I need to plan in advance in order to bring someone with me, and accommodate my work and school schedule. Plus, I would be really disappointed if I have to wait even longer. \n\nI kept my medical abortion appointment for now in case I change my mind AGAIN in the next 24 hours. I am however somewhat confident that I want surgical, as I don\u2019t want to see the tissue go down the toilet, nor do I want to wonder whether it\u2019s working or not or if my symptoms/bleeding are normal, etc. I\u2019m a very anxious person as it is, and I\u2019m scared to death that it won\u2019t work or that I will have a complication. I prefer to be in a controlled environment and \u201cget it over with.\u201d\n\nThanks for reading all this, and I appreciate any comments or guidance you might have. ",

        "body": "I\u2019ve posted a few times. I found out I was pregnant nearly 3 weeks ago.  I came off birth control to let my body adjust before my husband and I actually try for kids. I\u2019ve had a problem with ovarian cysts (not PCOS related), and wanted time to let my cycles regulate. After 6 years on hormonal birth control and losing an ovary, I figured it could take awhile to become regular. \n\nAs luck would have it, it didn\u2019t, and we continued to use barrier methods. When my husband got a great new job, we decided we needed to wait on kids until he hit the 12 month mark with his new company and could take time off upon the birth of a child.\n\nObviously I got pregnant. I was a day late on my period, so tested in mid August- positive. I went in 4 days later, but wasn\u2019t far enough along to do anything (my clinic requires 5+ weeks to avoid ectopic complications). So I scheduled to today. \n\nAfter a lot of thought, I went surgical. Unfortunately the general anesthesia wasn\u2019t an option for me at my appointment, as the CRNA who does it only scheduled a couple days a month. My options were \u201ctwilight\u201d or local. I opted for twilight anesthesia- a combination of fentanyl and versed, in addition to a local anesthetic (lidocaine into the cervix). For most people, they\u2019ll feel as if they slept. \n\nWhen I arrived, I had to walk past a few protesters. I shrugged it off- they have no idea why anyone makes these choices. Personally, they\u2019d \u201csave a lot more babies\u201d if they put their energy into advocating for strong family leave laws (in my case, the sole reason I chose to end this pregnancy), living wages, and comprehensive affordable health care. (Still, I\u2019m ardently pro choice, I\u2019m just pointing out for someone like me, this wasn\u2019t an unwanted child, but our country\u2019s laws don\u2019t protect my partner\u2019s job until after a full year, and I\u2019m not willing to go through the first few weeks of parenthood without my partner).\n\nOnce inside I filled out consent forms, they checked my iron again from my last appointment, did an ultrasound to date the pregnancy (6w2d), and went over after care.\n\nI was moved to a waiting room after changing into a gown and slippers, and nervously waited. When it was my turn I hopped on the table, scared out of my wits. The nurse gave me some versed while we waited for the doctor, then more with the fentanyl when we were ready. Unfortunately for me, I stayed pretty aware. I wasn\u2019t surprised by this, as previous medical procedures have determined I tend to be someone that takes quite a bit of anesthesia.\n\nThe procedure itself hurt a fair amount, but only on three occasions during- the shots into the cervix, dilation, and the brief suction. It felt like a sharper pressure and not much of a cramp. I personally never get period cramps, so maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad for others used to such pain? Either way, I whimpered a few times, the staff assured me, and the nurse help my hand and warned me when it would hurt and reminded me to breathe.\n\nI was transferred to a gurney and taken to recovery, where I had mild-moderate cramps, but nothing terrible. Within 10 minutes it was almost no pain at all. They monitored my BP and pulse, and after 20 minutes was assisted into disposable underwear with a pad. I used the restroom, wasn\u2019t bleeding, and put on my clothes.\n\nMy husband met me and we went straight for sandwiches, as I hadn\u2019t eaten or drunk anything since the evening prior.\n\nIn a way, it was both harder and easier than I expected. Yes, it hurt, but it was very quick, and I\u2019d take what I went through (so far) over what I\u2019ve read of medical abortions. \n\nEmotionally I\u2019m fine with my decision, but mad at a system that forces people like me (well, anyone) to go to clinics instead of their own doctor and feel shamed for a decision made with care. I have amazing health care, but my insurance doesn\u2019t cover elective abortion, so couldn\u2019t use the same doctors that have seen me through multiple other gynecological procedures. \n\nMore than anything for me, I\u2019m upset that this is something my husband and I want eventually, but because new parents aren\u2019t always protected or given the support they need to be with new children, it can force difficult decisions like mine.  I\u2019m excited to be in a position to try next year, but absolutely at peace with this decision.",

First is this article about pregnancy anxiety, which is definitely common after an abortion - and even more so after bc failure, I think. I think it will definitely resonate with you: [https://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/youre\\_not\\_pregnant\\_why\\_do\\_you\\_think\\_you\\_are](https://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/youre_not_pregnant_why_do_you_think_you_are) It has some great ideas for how to start getting to a place where fear about pregnancy is no longer taking over your life. \n\nI also wanted to recommend this emotional healing after an abortion workbook, which has a lot of great exercises around guilt and healing: [https://www.pregnancyoptions.info/emotional&spiritual.htm](https://www.pregnancyoptions.info/emotional&spiritual.htm). It's nonjudgmental and not religious unless you bring your own religion to it (if you have one). It's long so there will definitely be some stuff that isn't resonant for you, but take what is useful and leave what isn't. \n\nHope you can find a solution that helps you get back to feeling more like yourself!",

The doc would inject him in the area with lidocaine; it's a very tiny needle that's used, but it's what most guys were most afraid of. There's a small incision made in the scrotal sac, and the vas deferens is exposed; it is cut, a segment is removed, and the two ends are cauterized. The same thing is done on the other side, and a small stitch is put where the incision is made. He's told to use ice packs on the area, and to follow up at PP to make sure he's not expelling sperm any more. That's it-it's so much easier than the general anesthesia done on a woman.

I also think I may be having a miscarriage and the doctors office I was going to used stall tactics on me after they found out my plans so I cant go back there to get blood tests because who knows how long I'll wait. Even knowing I had an IUD and obviously didn't want a child. \n\nCan't wait till I get old enough (whenever that is all doctors make up some arbitrary number when I ask) to get my tubes tied and by done with this nonsense. You'd think being on my 4th abortion would be evidence enough for any doctor that I most assuredly don't want to be a birth Mom but apparently not. \n\nIdk I just wanted to get some feelings in the open, thanks.",

        "body": "hello. I would like to share my abortion story and offer some recovery tips to people looking for them. When it happened to me, I find that there are a lot of helpful tips given online regarding the procedure itself, but very few on (long term) after care. I have aborted twice, and I can feel the difference in my recovery the second time round, as I paid more attention to nutrition and aftercare.\n\nSo. Some background on me. I am Asian. I live in Singapore. So I have good access to both western medicine and traditional chinese medicine. My first abortion was in May 2015, 7-8 weeks, I was 25. My second abortion was in March 2017, 6 weeks, I was 27. I had surgical abortion both times in a private clinic.\n\n**Skin**:\nSo the first sign of my pregnancy I noticed was huge cystic chin acne. I have never ever had acne on my chin, I do get occasional pimples on my forehead or nose, but never on the chin till I was pregnant. Before I was pregnant, I never had huge skin issues, I was known to have pretty good skin to people around me. But the nightmare started with my first pregnancy.\n\nAfter my first abortion, my skin just went downhill. And I know its hormonal related because they are the huge cystic ones. I started drinking a lot more water, 3-4 litres a day, but it did not help much. I go to esthetician regularly to clear my clogged pores, but they still pop up every now and then. I do not take birth control pills.\n\nIn Nov 2015, I took a morning after pill to be safe... God did I regret that. It was not my first time taking a morning after pill, and I did not have any adverse effects before. But this time, my acne issue turn from bad to worse. My entire lower face was covered with huge pimples, many new ones per day. \n\nI started adding vitamin c, aha and bha into my skincare routine. It helped my blemishes recover faster, but still doesn\u2019t solve the root problem. The aha and bha I use for my skin are from paula\u2019s choice, cosrx and renee rouleau.\n\nHaving doctors referring to my skin problem as \u2018acne\u2019 deeply hurt my self-esteem. This was something I never had to experience during my teen years. Due to my acne problem, colleagues start to ask what happened to me, giving me general advice though they don\u2019t know the root cause of my problem. I would just say, I have a hormonal problem. But the good-skin-folks will shower in comments like, maybe you should change your skin care, is your pillow dirty, drink more water\u2026 I had advice from a gp that full recovery from an abortion takes 2 years. Also, she said that it is common to have such hormonal acne during 25-30yo, as she has experienced it herself.\n\nDuring this time I went to seek help from dermatologists. They offered me very common solutions such as retinol, chemical peels and laser treatments. I was prescribed retinol and a pimple drying gel. But I threw them away after some time. Firstly, the pimple drying gel stopped working after a few months, like as if my skin was immune to it. Second, retinol can cause birth defects, (it was written in the instruction sheet in the retinol box that it caused birth defects in lab baby rabbits).\n\nSo I started to see a tcm practitionist in mid 2016 who is known for fertility and hormonal issues (also because of other problems I had which is listed below). He does acupuncture on my ear, lower abdomen and inner ankles, and gives me tcm to take every month.\n\nAround the same time in 2016, I saw a holistic dentist for my amalgam tooth problem. She did a heavy metal test with my saliva, and it was positive with heavy metals. She highlighted the need for my body to detox heavy metal everyday, especially when I havnt been passing motion regularly enough (will get to that below). She put me on probiotics and fibre supplement to help pass motion everyday. I sticked to using probiotics regularly ever since as I learnt that acne is very much linked to gut health.\n\nWith the combination of probiotics and tcm treatment (along with other changes I will discuss below) I can say I definitely see my skin improved. By end of 2016, my skin was more or less stable with a few occurring pimples every month. It could also be because, like what the gp told me, it takes 2 full years to fully recover from an abortion, and perhaps its because I was nearing the 2 full years of recovery, that is why my acne was getting better. \n\nI am lucky that I do not have any obvious scarring from the deep cystic acne, thanks to my aestheticians and my full set of skincare routine. But I had a lot of red/ brown pimple marks all over my face. So I went for laser treatments. The doctor recommended q-switch for the pigmentation and marks, and CO2 fractional laser for overall skin texture. These lasers worked very well on me and some days when I am blemish free, I feel confident enough to be make up free.\n\nJust when I was happy about my skin, I was pregnant again. \n\nAs expected, my (chin/jawline/upper neck) acne issue surfaced again. As I was more prepared this time, I do feel that my acne post-second-abortion is much more controlled compared what I experienced the first time. I still get occasional one or two cystic acne, but I learn to live with it. I also added skin probiotics and B5+HA serum to my skincare which I think is working on me. \n\nIn June 2017, a condom broke, and I was afraid I will get pregnant again. I went to the doctor and got a morning after pill. But I hesitated. I did not want to take the pill, my body was telling me not to. I rmb the horror from the last time I had morning after pill. So I seek for a more natural alternative. Vitamin C.\n\nI took 8000-10000mg of ascorbic acid per day for about 10 days. In the end, I got my period, though it was super late. But it did not come at no cost. Small deeply embedded whiteheads were formed all over my face after a few days of vitamin c. It covered my forehead, temples, chin and jawline. It took me a few sessions of facials and 2-3 months to fully recover from these stubborn whiteheads. I will still take this over the full face cystic acne from morning after pill.\n\nThe changes to my skin were the most alarming to me, as it is something I see everyday which I cant ignore. If not for the changes on my face, I might not think that I need to make changes to my diet or skin regime. One thing I learn is, don\u2019t pop it yourself. I used to pop my own pimples and I thought I was quite good at it. But the cystic ones is another ball game. I leave it to the aestheticians to do their job, and my blemishes recover much faster.\n\nAnother thing I learn is to give yourself a facial massage. My aesthetician says that my face gets very red and hot after she massages it, meaning there is a lot of toxins. I try to give myself facial massages at home and after a few times, my face doesn\u2019t get as red as before, i feel it is better detoxed.\n\n**Diet (and weight gain) and rest after abortion**:\nFor my first abortion, I asked the nurses at my gynae, what I should eat for recovery. They told me not to take any tcm herbs, as some might cause heavier blood discharge. \n\nAt the same time, I am Chinese, and I believe the importance of confinement after pregnancy to prevent ailments such as rheumatism in the future. There are horror stories of women who have gone through 4 abortions and did not take care of themselves, and they started to show pre menopause symptoms by 30yo. There are very limited English references I could find regarding confinement for abortion though. So I ran a search on Chinese websites, and as you can imagine, it is a common search term in China due to one-child policy in China and modernisation of Chinese women.\n\nWhat I gathered was to get up to 2 weeks rest, no strenuous exercise, eat lots of proteins, replenish iron levels. Avoid \u2018cold\u2019 food by Chinese definition. Take \u2018warm\u2019, \u2018wind-expelling\u2019, and \u2018blood clearing\u2019 food.\n\nI don\u2019t claim to be an expert in confinement, as it is usually planned by the mother or mother-in-law of the expectant mother. As I kept my abortion a secret from my family, I did not have guidance from my mum. \n\nAfter my first abortion, I rested for 3 full days at home, of which first 2 days I did not bathe, only used water to clean my private parts when needed. I ate a lot of fish soup, eggs, lean meat and fresh vegetables. I took chicken essence everyday. I made black sugar, red dates, dried longan, wolfberry ginger tea for myself.\nFor the next few months post abortion, I will drink black sugar, red dates, dried longan, wolfberry ginger tea and chicken essence everyday at work. I also avoided exercising for many months, gave myself tons of excuses not to.\n\nI gained weight (55 to 58kg). Not a shocker. I was taking a big cube of black sugar everyday, all the calories add up. I stopped and cut back on sugar. Also stopped my chicken essence which was not necessary anymore.\n\nIt might be psychological, but I feel that my metabolism is not as high as before. I feel that exercising doesn\u2019t burn calories as it used to. But my weight was still stable with me controlling my food intake, and I maintained my weight at 56kg by end of 2015. \nIn 2016, I was also told my tcm practitioner, from my hormone test, that I should limit certain food intake such as chocolate, chicken, especially chicken neck (apparently in Singapore, hormones are injected in chicken through the neck), soy milk and royal jelly. He hit the jackpot as I am guilty of all except soy milk. Chicken neck is actually my fav part of chicken since young, though my family doesn\u2019t cook chicken very often.\n\nI also started taking advice from my holistic doctor by taking essential supplements to my diet. Camu camu for vitamin c, trace mineral drops or oxy e in my water, apple cider vinegar, cranberry extract for iodine and uti, spirulina for detox, cholera for heavy metal detox, collagen powder for skin and joints, green powder blend such as from paradise herbs, garden of life and vibrant health, fermented cod liver oil, fermented butter, black garlic\u2026I do feel that these supplements complete my micronutrient needs. I was too slow to realise that calories from these supplements adds up, theres about 150-250 calories from these supplements per day. My weight was at 59-60kg by end of 2016, though I feel I have better skin, and I don\u2019t get sick as often.\n\nPost second abortion, I took 1 full week of rest at home. I did not bathe for the first 2 days, subsequently when I had to shower, I boiled herbal water meant for confinement woman and used that to rinse my body.\n\nThis time, I wanted to have a better recovery, I was afraid I am doing too much damage to my body, and I considered ordering confinement food from local caterers. In the end I deemed it unnecessary, and I cooked my own meals. I made dishes such as red fermented rice chicken, pig liver with dom Benedictine sauce, and black chicken soup in red ginseng. I bought pig trotters in vinegar which is known for expelling wind. I also took lots of black fungus as it is known for clearing blood clots.\n\nI could feel slightly anemic for the first few days, after which I took garden of life raw iron for a month.\n\nI also took earth mama no more milk tea, as I have read that it helps swollen breasts to recover faster after miscarriage. It does seem to reduce my swollen breast faster compared to my first abortion.\n\nI also make a blend of red raspberry leaf+nettle leaf+astragalus(huang qi)+codonopsis pilosula(dang shen) tea, alternate with red gingeng tea as tonic drinks. And earth mama monthly comfort tea during my period.\n\n2 months after second surgery, I could feel joints pain, on my knees (old problem since young), and wrist. I was worried it was because of some heavy lifting during my 1 week of rest (I had to carry the boiled herbal water from kitchen to my shower). I bought paradise herbs collagen extreme with biocell collagen to supplement, and the joint pains seemed to go away.\n\nI took black sugar tea and chicken essence again. But I cut down on the sugar amount to a quarter of before. However, I started taking a shot of dom benedictine every night. I feel that dom Benedictine helps to \u2018flow\u2019 my blood as there are a good blend of herbs in it. I also feel that this good blood flow helps improve my skin condition.\n\nAfter a few months of dom Benedictine, I gained weight, again, at about 62kg. This time, the weight was gained on my love handles, which I did not have before.\n\nA bit of background on my diet, I do not have a habit of eating breakfast since young, and habitually I like to eat one meal a day (a huge meal). In other words, after some research, I have been on intermittent fasting without myself knowing. This is also shown in my 2016 urinalysis, where a small amount of ketones was detected (I am not diabetic).\n\nSo. One 30ml of dom Benedictine every night interrupts my intermittent fasting and I can assumed it was stored right at my love handles. I stopped taking dom Benedictine. But the love handles still did not go away.\n\nAlso with a few overseas trips and relative visiting in 2017, I overate by a good amount for the past few months. My weight has gone up to the highest ever at 63kg recently. I know I need to do something about my weight, especially the fats at my love handles/ mid waist area, which are known to be the least healthy.\nI know that I am already doing intermittent fasting irregularly, I need to make it regular. I just started on keto diet + intermittent fasting + calories restriction in the past one week, with 3 times exercise, and my weight dropped from 62-60kg within a week. I tested with keto strip and it was positive. I could see that my tummy is flatter. I will continue on my weight loss journey to my ideal goal of 55kg.\n\n**Constipation**:\nI have quite regular bowel movements in the past, once every 1-2 days. Especially during a period of time when I exercise very regularly, I will have bowel movement everyday at 10am sharp. However, my bowel movements are more irregular after my first abortion, I suspect a link between the antibiotics prescribed to me post abortion and the constipation I encounter after. \n\nIn July 2015, about 2 months after my first abortion, I experienced the worst constipation I have ever had in my life. I had to push so hard that I swear I could feel the stool was stuck at my perineum instead and not coming out. I went to the doctor and he said, yes my perineum looks a little tender, but he had to put his finger in my anus to check if the stool is indeed stuck. I did not let him check as I was not comfortable at that point of time, but I regret immediately after. I should have let him identify the problem. I was given lactulose syrup, and I combined with enema to completely clear my bowels. After which, I took lactulose irregularly to help to move my bowels, but it did not help the root cause.\n\nAfter the painful experience, I learn not to push too hard. I rather let the stool stay there, and wait till a few hours later, one day later, when I have a stronger urge to poop, then the stool will come out much easier. I also learn to sit in a squatting position, which is a more natural pooping position.\n\nWith this experience, I was afraid that my vaginal walls have weaken, which resulted in the stool stuck in the perineum area. I read that yoni eggs/ kegal exercise can help to strengthen the muscles, and I bought to try. However, I did not follow through :p\nAs said earlier, my holistic dentist gave me fibre supplement and probiotics, which ensures I have bowel movement everyday. I soon realise the probiotics was not helping the bowel movement, its just the fibre. So I tried to eat a lot of vegetables, but they never give me the same effect as the fibre supplement. Slowly but surely, I could feel that the fibre supplements are not as effective anymore. I was getting 1 or more bowel movement a day with fibre, slowly become 1 bowel movement in 1-1.5 days.\n\nI stopped the fibre supplements, and only take when necessary (if I have not had bowel movement for 3-4 days). I don\u2019t want to become reliant on it. I am currently experiencing with different probiotics supplements to see which ones work better for me. When I am taking Dr Ohhira, I do feel that I can have bowel movement almost every day. \n\nAlso, since young, I tend to get slight constipation before my period, and loose stool or diarrhoea during my period. My tcm said that constipation before period and loose stool during period is a sign of tilted uterus.\n\nMy tcm advised me to take papaya for bowel movement. It does work for me. But I had to take a whole papaya for it to work. That is too high a sugar content for my keto diet. So I stopped. \n\nMy tcm also gave me this tcm pills for constipation. I swear it works wonders too. I take it, and I get bowel movement the very next day. However, they have ran out of stock recently.\n\nI also read up on fibre and its relationship with constipation, that fibre can in fact worsen constipation as it is difficult to digest. In fact, low fibre diet is actually prescribed to patients with chronic constipation. I have yet to dedicate myself to try out a low fibre diet, but I might after I achieve my ideal weight. \n\n**Sex and Vaginal/ Hormonal Health**:\nAfter my first abortion, I ran into a few issues. I had a bad case of vaginal yeast infection which lasted a few months. Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) was found in my pap smear in dec 2015. Passing motion during period was painful. And sex was painful. \n\nWhen I went for my first review post-first-abortion, my gynae discovered that I am having yeast infection. I failed to notice, as my infection tends to be \u2018deep inside\u2019, and I don\u2019t see the common symptoms such as cheesy discharge. I did notice a foul stench though. I was told to cut sugar. He gave me medicine and I went back for review 3 more times (and a lot of money) to completely clear the infection. \n\nWhen I was preparing for my second abortion, I told myself I don\u2019t want the same thing to happen again. So I realise I need to strengthen my immune system, and take antifungal supplements. \nI took garden of life dr formulated probiotics once daily women for the first one month post second abortion. I also took barlean\u2019s olive leaf extract during the same time. Not sure if because of these two combo, but I did not have yeast infection during my check up post second abortion. \n\nIn dec 2015, LSIL was found in my pap smear. Meaning my cervical cells shows slightly abnormal changes. I was told to do a colposcopy which showed I had \u2018area of CIN 1 to 2\u2019. I was advised to go for a thin pap smear in march 2016. I went to another gynae for thin pap smear in march 2016, also for an second opinion, and my thin pap smear results showed that I still have the abnormal cells. These abnormal cells are usually caused by either infection or HPV. However, as I have had cervical cancer vaccine before, my HPV test was negative, the gynae said there is no risk of the abnormal cells caused by HPV (which will lead to cancer), so its probably just an infection and it will go away by itself, and continue with a pap smear half a year to one yr later. Both gynaes did not give me any medication for my cervical abnormal cells. In dec 2016, I took another routine pap smear test, and no abnormal cells were detected. I guess the problem is solved?\n\nDuring my heavier period days (day 2-4) after my first abortion, whenever I \u2018push\u2019 to pass motion, I will feel a sharp pain in my lower abdomen area. This pain only occurs when I push, not when the stool comes out. So its like, I push, sharp pain, then 5 seconds later the stool comes out. My periods after first abortion was also lighter than before.\n\nAfter my first abortion, I noticed that sex was painful, especially in certain positions, such as doggy. It did not used to hurt before. The intensity of the pain seem to lessen after time, however it was definitely there, till this day. \n\nI highlighted these problems to 2 gynaes, both did an ultrasound on me and said everything looks normal. One told me, maybe your body is just different alr. Another told me, despite these you still got pregnant the second time. I told my tcm practitioner, I pointed out to him the area where sharp pain occurs, which is about 5 cm below my belly button, he said its my large intestines and nothing to do with my uterus. Till this day I still have this problem and I do not know what is wrong with me.\n\nAfter my second abortion, I experienced spotting before and after mensus, which I never had before. Right after my second abortion, I noticed the bleeding pattern was a little different from the first time. During the first time, I bleed a little for the first 3-4 days, then there was no more bleeding. The second time, I bleed for 1-2 days, stopped, then a little bleeding during 7th, 8th day. For my first period after my second abortion, I had very heavy flow, and it dragged to about 10 days (my usual period is about 6 days, with 2nd and 3rd day my heavier flow). There was drops of light brown blood stain for the last 5 days. My tcm said that its because the uterus was not \u2018cleared up\u2019 properly, hence the heavy flow and spotting. He gave me shen hua tang to contract and clear the uterus, and some other tcm medicine after.\n\nI have had a few period cycles after my second abortion till now, and it usually starts with 1 day of spotting (I never had this), then follow by first day of period. Then occasionally I get a little spotting even after first week of period (I never had this either).\n\nI have to accept at this point that my body is not in ideal condition, I asked my tcm practitioner how can I improve my situation and solve all these problems. His answer, to give birth and do a full proper confinement. It is not unheard of, there is a saying in Chinese that a proper confinement is a chance for a woman to \u2018reborn\u2019. If done properly, the woman will be more youthful than before. There are cases of chronic migraine cured after a confinement. Till that day comes for me, I will stick to my routine tcm treatments, which I find has helped me regulate my cycles and balance my hormones thus far.",

              "body": "Typically, when a pregnant woman gets assaulted, the charges are more serious (especially if the fetus dies, and the charges are even more serious if it was intentional).\nAssaulting children, the elderly, and pregnant woman typically have more serious legal consequences. Some states have laws that make it more serious, and even if there aren't laws specifically protecting them, most people are more sympathetic and protective towards children, old people, and pregnant women. \n\nI wouldn't use the word \"pro-abortion\". \"Pro-choice\" is the right word. I believe every woman should have the choice to have an abortion or keep the pregnancy. I am pro-choice, so I'll answer your questions from that perspective.\n\n\"If a pregnant woman is punched once in the belly and the child growing in her is killed should the offender be charged with anything more than the standard assault that goes with punching someone once?\"\nLike I said above, there are typically laws that protect pregnant women. And even if there aren't specific laws, I firmly believe that when someone assaults another person, and the person experiences a serious health complication, the charges should be more serious. So to answer your question, yes, they should be charges for more than just standard assault. But they should not be charged with murder. \nEven if the woman was planning an abortion tomorrow, it doesn't matter. It's her right to be safe, and make her own choices for her body. No one has the right to strip her of her safety and her choices. \n\n\" What if a boyfriend sneaks an abortion pill to his girlfriend and no harm is done to her but a child is killed.\"\nThere is absolutely harm being done to the woman. Of course a crime had been committed. She was drugged, and stripped of her right to carry her child. That boyfriend should absolutely go to jail for intentionally drugging her, endangering her life, and could have killed her in the process. Again, the boyfriend should not be faced with nurse charges, but probably will be, and SHOULD be charged for very serious crimes. \n\nIn all these circumstances, none of it is murder, because a fetus is not a human with individual rights. But the woman has a right to be safe, and make choices about her body. I am pro-CHOICE, not pro-abortion. The woman can choose to have an abortion, or keep her pregnancy. If she wants to have a baby, no one has the right to take that away from her (aside from very rare cases such as if she is mentally retarded or mentally ill and a pregnancy will be dangerous for her and the fetus. Then I think a doctor can make a decision.) I firmly believe there should be stricter charges for people who harm pregnant women. Because you didn't just harm the woman. You took away something very precious to her. Even if she was planning to get an abortion, you took away her power to choose for herself. What if she decides not to get an abortion the day she is suppose to get an abortion? If she got assaulted the day before and lost her pregnancy, she no longer has that choice. \n\nOh, and women should not be allowed to smoke and drink while pregnant. Yes, it's her body, but if she is choosing to carry her pregnancy to term and create another life, she absolutely has no right to make this child suffer. \n",

But I feel like it all happened really quickly. \n\n\n(Copied and pasted from another post I made about 45mins ago)\n\nThis was/is my ongoing experience with the MA: \n\nHey! I\u2019m going through my first MA right now. Got my mifepristone on Friday around 1 and waited til 7 this evening to take the misoprostol. I\u2019ll give my experience as a sort of play by play so you can see what has happened to me so far.\n(I luckily got prescribed some heavy pain Killers** edit- oxycodone and an anti-nausea (I don\u2019t remember the name of it)** medication to help with the process.)\n\nJust before 7pm I took my anti-nausea medication and 800mg of ibuprofen. About 7:10 I did the buccal option of taking the misoprostol. So I put four pills total, (2) on either side of my mouth, between my cheeks and gums and held it there for the 30mins, then swished and swallowed what remained. \nIn that 30mins of waiting I already was starting to cramp up and right around 8pm I was in so much pain that I threw up everything I had for dinner. (I\u2019m glad I ate though because it would have been so much worse) \n\n* I\u2019ve had a history of bad periods but only a handful have made me writhe on the bathroom floor thinking I wasn\u2019t gonna make it. \n\nIt was at this point that I started to bleed, at first it was only a little, but got progressively heavier. The pain was just like one of those bad periods, but a bit worse. Because I hadn\u2019t waited long enough for the pain meds to kick in, it was an awful hour of cramping and occupying the bathroom. And I had thrown up the medication that would have helped \ud83d\ude12\n\nAround 8:25, I couldn\u2019t take the pain any longer, so I took one of the heavier duty pain meds they prescribed me (**edit- the oxycodone), which luckily started working in about 20mins\n\n*my partner brought me some crackers at this point because I felt I could keep it down\n\nBy 8:50pm I started feeling like a human again. It was at this point I was comfortable enough to pick myself off the floor and sit back on the toilet and pass a pretty big clot. Ngl, it did freak me out a little(this is totally normal though and it will happen several times-if you do end up bleeding completely through a super thick pad over 2 times in two hours, you should call PP or your clinic/go to the ER bc you could have an infection) so just try your best to gauge about how much has passed. I ended up passing two more big clots by 11:30pm.\nIt is now 1:45am and my cramps have been light and the bleeding has significantly lightened up as well. I was able to have a second dinner to make up for the one I lost and have been drinking lots of water to avoid dehydration (I forgot to mention I did experience period poos as well)\n\nHope this helps! This is my first time going through this and also my first time posting anywhere on Reddit, so I apologize for any issues in this post.\n\nWe are stronger than we think we are and you\u2019re gonna come out just fine.",

If it's been a month, you should already know one way or the other. Have her take a test. Watch the test with her after she pees on it but before it gives the result. I know someone whose girlfriend lied about being pregnant so he would have unprotected sex with her so she could get pregnant. That's most likely not the case here, but make sure she is being honest with you since your relationship is new.\n\nAs far as an abortion goes, you can't talk her into it. It's her body and her decision. You can make your case, but you shouldn't pressure her to do something with her body she doesn't want to do. Hopefully you will come to the right choice together.\n\nGoing forward, take it upon yourself to be responsible for birth control. Your girlfriend gets sick from the pill? Wear a condom. And help her go to a clinic to explore non-hormonal options. (The pill makes me super sick, but I'm very happy with my diaphragm, and it has worked very well.)\n\nGood luck!",
