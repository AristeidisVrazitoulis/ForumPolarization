That would be like saying that there was nothing fishy about an all-white Congress from the end of the Civil War to the victory of the civil rights movement.  \n\n>Did you vote for Romney or Obama? And then, to follow that up, did you vote for Romney because he was Christian, or Obama because he's Christian?\n\nThe fact that every modern candidate has been Christian is enough to show that only a Christian could garner that kind of national viablity because so many people would be unwilling to vote for a non-Christian; it's like saying that South Africa under Apartheid wasn't racist because you could either vote for the white candidate or the other white candidate.  Additionally, it is only as of 2012 that a bare majority of Americans would even consider voting for a president that didn't believe in God.\n\n>I don't disagree that there is a Christian privilege, but I don't think that it's simple existence gives tacit validation to anti-Christian sentiments.\n\nAgain, though, where is this anti-Christian sentiment?  I see lots of posts attacking Christianity, but not a single one attacking Christians.  Christianity is an idea which, like any other, can be attacked and defended.  You (I assume, and hope) disagree with Holocaust deniers, but that doesn't mean that you hate them.  Similarly, I find Christianity to be an utterly repugnant and irredeemably wrong set of ideas about ethics, metaphysics, and physical reality.  I will debate about it all day, but you will never find me saying that I hate Christians.",

In fact, the only truly \"privileged\" Christians are Protestants, for they hold the political power and are the largest Christian faction. Further, applying the term \"privileged\" to people of religion is rarely applicable these days. (With the exception being Muslims, who are underprivileged as a result of misguided fear.) Christians would only be privileged if they were given more in life as a result of being Christian, but in today's PC world, it's considered \"inappropriate\" to discuss one's religion and therefore it is difficult to factor in faith when deciding on, for example, whether or not to give someone a job, or even more simply, preferential treatment.\n\nYou are out of your fucking mind if you think that Christians aren't heavily privileged in the US.  They are now, and they have been historically.  It is only through hard-fought, unpopular legal victories that we find ourselves now somewhat free of the direct influence of religion over civic life.  \n\nEven so, [91.5% of the House and 87% of the Senate are some form of Christian](http://www.businessinsider.com/religious-makeup-of-the-113th-congress-2012-11).  100% of Presidents past the Founding Fathers have been Christian, and the Founding Fathers were Deists and Unitarians.  Atheists are considered unelectable at the national level, with all other religions making up an extreme minority.  I would go on, but if you cared at all about the facts regarding Christian privilege you would have bothered to Google it and read [the Wikipedia article about it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_privilege).",

But I don't think it is a legal imperative. And the further point is, you tell THAT MAN that's yelling to sit down. Not the entire group that he arbitrarily associates himself with. Listen, if someone around me is speaking hatefully, I promise you, I am the first to say something. I know I could just be saying that, and since it's the Internet, I have no way of proving it, but please, just believe in my integrity in this situation. So, if someone is speaking hatefully, I will stop them. If they use their religion as an excuse, I will not shoot down their religion, I will explain, clearly and concisely, why they have misinterpreted the Bible, Torah, Quaran etc. But I would never attack the religion itself, I would simply reinterpret passages from their Holy Books. The passages \"justifying\" homophobia are few and far between and are all vague. They don't clearly state \"God hates gays and lesbians, they will burn in hell.\" It is more vague, such as the \"gone after strange flesh\" passage in Jude 7. People such as them are misusing \"their\" religion, just as people used to use the Bible and the Mark of Cain to justify racism. So, I am in fact an advocate of social justice, but social justice is not freedom from having people direct hateful speech towards you. If loud-mouth homophobes were not aloud to say their homophobic piece, then that would be wrong. It would violate the 1st Amendment. Now, the issue lies, not only in the principle of it, but in the flip-side. If their 1st Amendment Rights are restricted, who's to say ours won't be as well. Do you see? So, yes, I am an advocate for social justice, ask me an issue, I guarantee we will be on the same page, and I may even be more liberal than you. ",

Plenty of churches are taking a stance in support of LGBT, so the generalization hurts, and feels like hate speech towards Christians in general.  And yes, there was the old idea of the \"other\" and the generally acknowledged idea in history that anyone who was not part of their elite group, but this is 2013.  There just so happens to be a different, more considerate idea that there are other beliefs.  \n\nA little about my own experience: In my church, we have a bible study that specifically dove into Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and many other smaller religions, then analyzed the similarities within all of them.  A theory that we looked at (and I personally enjoy) is that most religions point to one higher power (God, Allah, Zeus, the idea of enlightenment as a higher power), and that it wasn't about specifics in the end, it's about good intentions.  By this theory, no one can be \"elite,\" it's all about personal intentions.  \n\nWhether or not you agree with this, it takes out the idea of the supreme vs. the other, and makes the \"No true Scotsman\" fallacy obsolete.

Additionally, people who believe what you wrote above are largely not the people in power.  I care about the laws and nothing more; people can be as racist, sexist, homophobic, etc as they want in their personal lives so long as I don't have to live by rules they've forced into the law.\n\nThe point was that Christians often say that anyone who doesn't believe like they do, or who does something to make Christians look bad, isn't a \"real\" Christian.  This is an annoying excuse, and when it is used, as above by lutris, it is a textbook example of the \"No true Scotsman\" fallacy being trotted out again.",

Old Testament: something along the lines of \"homosexuality is an abomination.\"  Many scholars have dug back into the original Hebrew of this to not only prove that \"abomination\" wasn't the same term as back then, but simply a variation of \"bad,\" but also to prove that this was only a law to differentiate the Jews from the Egyptians, and to also build up their population (since the Egyptians were kind of making the Jews die of in slavery.)\nTHIS IS A DIFFERENT AGE THAN BACK THEN. \n\nNew Testament comes around, everything changes; don't have to kill animals and shit to forgive sins, and this crazy hippie dude named Jesus is going around telling everyone to love each other.  He's telling women that they are not below men and that they should stop being treated in this way, he's telling lepers that they didn't do anything sinful in nature to deserve this sickness, they just didn't wash themselves.  At this point, scholars are looking into what was left out of the bible about homosexuality.  No one can yet speak of truth here, as it is in speculation, but there are a few scholars that argue that not only was Jesus supporting LGBT, but that Paul was also gay for Jesus (again: just some scholars, not yet proven facts.)\n\nSo how about that for proving that there is a Christian perspective that SUPPORTS LGBT?\n\nThat being said, please, *please* just understand that this is a perspective, and that not all Christians think this way, but it works in reverse: this proves that not all Christians believe that homosexuality is a sin.  There are even some that have the crazy notion that this was the love that Jesus taught, and we should all be encouraging of each other.",

And Christians can be denied service or fired from their jobs simply for being Christian in large parts of the country.  I could give more examples, but hopefully that was enough to show how fucking ignorant of a statement that was.  When you're done with the platitude shit, the rest of us will be waiting in the real world.\n\n>If certain Christians don't love us back... So what? \n\nThen our human and civil rights continue to be trampled upon.  You know, a really minor inconvenience.\n\n>Show them that we can do what their own bible taught them and love them for whoever they choose to be. \n\nWhy would I do that?  I'm not bound by their filthy morality.  I don't love my enemies, and neither should you.  I hate my enemies, and I want them to lose their political and cultural power and be replaced.  It's a zero-sum game; either we will win and our rights will be respected or they will win and we'll be back to square one.  I know which side I'm on, how about you?  And consider that question carefully, because it might mean you have to criticize some of those poor, oppressed Christians.",

                          "body": "For what its worth, I upvoted you. Partially because of the recent spate of these sort of posts, yours was so far the least offensive (except for the part comparing it to wanting to be a cat). And a good reason why not many people respond is that:\n\n1) these questions have been answered a LOT and people are tired of repeating themselves, and the askers often get defensive when other people post links saying \"I don't want to read something, I want someone to answer\". Imagine being asked the same question day after day after day. You'd get sick of it too, and eventually just start referring people to where its answered elsewhere.\n\n2) Most of these sort of topics generally turn into attacks, if they aren't that from the outset. Also very tiring.\n\n3) Its easy to get fed up with people repeatedly demanding you to justify your very existence.\n\nAs far as the reasons for T being in with LGB:\n\n1) We're all mostly fighting the same battles against the same people for pretty much the same reason. We all want not to be discriminated against in housing and jobs, and are denied that for the same reasons: Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender people are discriminated against because they all don't conform to different aspects of what society expects of us, especially in regard to gender roles. Its the stereotype that gays are not \"manly\" enough, or lesbians are not \"feminine\" enough that lies at the heart of the matter. \n\n2) T's have been part of it from the beginning, fighting the same fight. As an example, even though its far from the beginning of the movement, it was trans people who started the Stonewall riots against the oppression that was affecting us all.\n\n3) As has been mentioned before, a lot of Trans people also fit into the LGB spectrum (e.g. F2M's being gay males, M2F's being lesbians, etc).\n\n4) When it comes to issues like same-sex marriage, that's also a trans issue. With regards to marriage, in some states the trans person is considered the sex they were assigned at birth. In others they are considered the sex they transitioned to. This makes marriage a tricky issue at best, and not an option at all for some (e.g. the bigots who don't want to recognize the new gender, but will also refuse a marriage that for all appearances is a same-sex one - e.g. a M2F marrying another woman).\n\nAs for the biologics of it all, of course there is nothing definitive out there as to the cause. The same can be said about homosexuality. What is known is that all humans start out the same sexually, regardless of their chromosomes (XX, XY, or any of the other variations): a group of cells called Gonads forms. At a certain time in fetal development, hormones will cause these same source cells to transform into either form testes or ovaries. Typically the hormones are controlled via the chromosomes, but in the case of certain genetic factors as well as non-XX or non-XY chromosomes, you don't get the expected result. These conditions are called Intersex. The prevalence of the various intersex conditions out there is about 1 to 2 percent of all births. Although intersex is somewhat different than trans per se, it does lead into some of the more prevalent theories as to the cause of transsexuality.\n\nPeople are not born a blank slate. Although we learn a lot from experience, there is plenty that is hard wired. One of those things happens to be a map of ones own body (e.g. that you have two arms, two legs, etc). As evidence of this, even some people born without limbs have reported phantom limb symptoms like those who have had amputations feel. There are other instincts that are inborn, like babies suckling, holding your breath underwater (newborns do this instinctively), etc. There is also lots of evidence that our gender identity is one of those things we are born with. This is distinct from learned behaviors of socialized gender (which has to do more with society). One theory of transsexualism is that for whatever reason (genetics, or the wrong hormones, or the wrong timing of the hormones) causes the gender identity of the brain to form differently from one's apparent external sex or even chromosomes (as discussed earlier, apparent external sex does not necessarily show what chromosomes you have).\n\nWhatever the cause, the psychological issues for trans people deal explicitly with the difference between what the world tells them they are and should be based on external appearance vs everything their mind says they should be. What can be said is that after decades of research, the only verifiable course of treatment for people with GID to lead to a better life is some sort of transition to the role their mind says. Research in past decades has included some of the same things that researchers have tried for \"curing\" gays over the years: e.g. giving testosterone to make them more masculine (if their external sex is male) but only resulted in the situation becoming worse. For some people \"cross-dressing\" is enough (in some cases only part-time, or in private). For others hormone treatment is enough. For some, full transition is what it takes. \n\nSo what does a better life mean? It means one in which the gender identity issue is not getting in the way of them being able to live a productive life. A life where the normal annoyances everyone faces (going to work, paying bills, etc) don't take a back seat to having to deal with identity issues. It may mean there are many more external issues to deal with, but you can't tackle external problems if you keep having to grind away at internal ones. In much the same way closeted gays suffer depression, self-defeatism, and suicide the solution is the same: to be true to one's self, true to one's nature, and accept yourself for who you really are. So it really shouldn't become surprising how many different things can be fixed by doing that, no matter what your true self is.",

It's possible to have conflicting signals in the brain despite whatever genitalia you're born with and being chromosomally typical. \n\nHere's another interesting point that hasn't been investigated yet. VS Ramachandran in his book, Phantoms in the Brain, wrote about a case study involving a girl born with no arms who had phantom limbs. This may indicate that we have a innate, genetic or preprogrammed idea of what our \"Self\" should be. \n\nAdditionally, nothing is nature versus nurture. It's nature and nurture almost in all cases. \n\nOn another note, if I had two vaginas, I'd more than likely be ashamed, self-conscious of something that I felt didn't suit my body or didn't belong instead of trying to fit more objects into it.

This man http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1052934/Cat-Man--human-tiger-enjoys-climbing-trees-eats-raw-meat-day.html believes he has become a tiger through a religious journey of transformation. But also there are numerous instances of feral children who were adopted by wolves (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_child) who, upon being discovered, appear to believe they are of the species they've grown up with. These are different issues and I do agree that someone think themselves to be another species is different to someone thinking of themselves as a different gender but on this point I am confused as to what, exactly, the distinction is.\n\nFor example, many years ago swapping genders wasn't possible because we did not have the technology. T people still existed but they were always their initial gender as far as society saw them. So with the advent of better technology people can swap genders but in the future will this freedom of identity expand to allow people to become something other than human? Maybe in a hundred years it'll be LGBTA or a whole new group of characters will emerge. Is it simply prejudice that makes the distinction or is there a solid measurable difference?\n\nI certainly believe there needs to be more concise information out there to make these topics easier to digest for the general public. Most people would not have continued to reply civilly after being shot down so in such a harsh way so I can understand the argument doesn't seem to progress. It is bad but until people at large have a better understanding of the T issue T people will have to deal with it as best as they can - the **exact** same way that GLB people have and any other minority. Simply asking a question does not constitute an attack.",

If a woman believed whole-heartedly she should have been a man and she has an operation to physically and legally become a man and this is accepted what if another person believed they were a cat? Not a furry, I mean an actual feline.\n\n\n3. A GLB or straight person knows their sexuality simply because it is but is it the same for transgendered people regarding gender or does something else happen?\n**EDIT:/ It is whatever the person feels most comfortable projecting. Gender identity is physical and mental and the issues arise when the mental self is not happy acting as the physically assigned gender**\n\n\n4. If a man suffers a terrible accident that completely destroys his genitals is he still a man... and if he is then why? A male to female sex change is an operation that does exactly that.\n**EDIT:/ Gender identity is in two parts as mentioned above. This question is no longer relevant after reading the edit on point 3.**\n\n\nI'm not trolling but I do realise this will offend a lot of people so before people rant can anyone actually provide some insight? I feel hypocritical for not understanding the 'T' in LGBT but I really do not have anything to go on.\n\nThanks\n\n**EDIT:/ Its been a difficult discussion so far and there's a lot of insta-hate going on but I think my understanding has progressed a lot so I am very grateful to everyone that has answered my questions**",

When i told my friends about it, their response was \"oh, yea, guys do that sometimes\"\n\nAnd i definitely notice gay men being much more inappropriate with women than would generally be acceptable.\n\nNot that gay men are the only ones who do it or anything, but it is an issue within this community.",

No one is dictating who you are but you, they're not forcing you into anything just because they happen to be gay also.\n\n>I have two big fears about being gay, one is AIDS, and two is dieing alone.\n\nA lot of people fear dying alone.  My grandpa grieved so much when my grandma died not just because he loved her, but because he lived his life thinking he was going to die first.  He was mourning her loss, and now had to face living alone for the first time in over 50 years.\n\nAIDS is a virus that can infect anyone, and it exists worldwide.  The heteronormative culture also fears AIDS because they are also contracting it, so it is no longer just a LGBT issue.\n\n\n>All gay people want equal right, that cool, yet they separate themselves from everyone else, you even have your own flag!\n\nEqual rights does not mean same interests.  Sure there are a lot of gays at a pride parade, and there are tons of Irish people marching with bagpipes on St. Patrick's day.  The Irish aren't segregating themselves, yet they proudly wave their flags.\n\n>I'm not try to bash anyone, but it just seems to me that it's just some sob story after another. \n\nMy best friend of over 16 years is a gay man.  He is openly gay with his family and friends and when he came out none of us minded because we somehow already knew.  His biggest sob story would probably just be the fact that he is currently studying music at Rutgers, so having such a tragedy on campus really hits home.  \n\n\n>However it did keep me from fitting in with the cool kids, and I do feel like I was robbed of some of the HS experiences.\n\nMy best friend and I actually met in HS.  Our little clique was all a bunch of \"misfits\" that never got to be in the popular crowd.  But we all had each other so we didn't need to be their brand of cool.  We did our own thing and that was cool enough for us.  We were all kind of geeky/nerdy which made for some good times hanging out.\n  ",

More seriously, flags are symbols to represent a group.  The rainbow, in particular, represents diversity.  The \"gay community\" is made up of people of different races, religions, genders, etc.- that encompass a broad spectrum of variation.  The rainbow flag also stands out.  It's incredibly visible.  This is important when lgbt people have been invisible for so long.  It's easy to ignore a group if you don't see their presence around.\n\n>One last thing is, I have two big fears about being gay, one is AIDS, and two is dieing alone.\n\nThe latter is a pretty universal concern, regardless of orientation.  The former I'd believe comes from the association of being gay and AIDS.  By many who are anti-gay, they like to emphasize this to make it sound like being gay is a destructive and unhealthy lifestyle that shouldn't be \"promoted\" because of the danger to society it is.  I don't want to downplay the seriousness of AIDS - it is a huge concern, and the gay community has been greatly impacted by it.  By no means, however, does it mean all gay men have AIDS or everyone who has AIDS is gay.  AIDS is *not* a \"gay disease.\"  \n\nIn general, most people would dread getting a type of STD, cancer, or some other illness or disability that would change how they live their life.  You're not alone in that.  Diabetes is common in some families - it'd probably be a great concern of someone about being/becoming diabetic (or depression/schizophrenia/whatever).  It might be a justifiable concern, but all you can do is take the precautions you can.  In many cases, eating right and exercising will help prevent many things.  For AIDS, it involves wearing a condom and using good judgment when it comes to having sex - what you do, and who you do it with.\n\nThe reason why there are a lot of sad stories made present is to highlight that bad things *do* happen to glbt individuals.  Does it happen to everyone?  No.  Certainly not.  News generally cover the good things in life.  It's the bad things that get the attention.  Bringing attention to the discrimination and harassment also brings an opportunity to educate.  If these went unnoticed, it'd be seen that the glbt community doesn't have any problems... and then it'd be easy to ignore the discrimination and harassment again.\n\nEdit:  \n\n>I just find the gay culture, well too gay, or more of a giant support group.\n\nEveryone needs a support group.  It makes sense to find others who have similar issues to go to for that support.",

              "body": "There's a lot in your post, more than I can respond to but I wanted to respond to your \"Sucks to be Gay\" part. Aspects of being gay have sucked. In high school I wanted nothing other than to wish it away. I was engaged in a decade long argument with my mother. I watched my ex eventually die of AIDS. So yes parts of it sucked. But it also made me who I am today.\n\nThe generation right before me was devastated by AIDS so in many ways I already had it better just based on timing. At least I knew about AIDS and had the tools in my head to avoid it. But that generation also pulled together. They taught each other how to be safe when government leaders would not even say the word, AIDS. The fact that I'm alive has a lot to do with being taught safe sex by those just a few years older than me. I still remember the safe sex class I took where this bear of a guy showed a class of teens and twenty somethings how to put on a condom and how not to freak out about sex and I'm forever grateful. I don't know if this sort of thing still happens but I sure hope it does.\n\nHave safe sex and you won't have to worry about AIDS.  There's never 100% guarantee but if you don't put yourself in compromising situations with people who will try to hurt you and you use condoms for butt sex then you have nothing to worry about (or very very little). They don't tell you that but believe it. I'm negative but dated a positive guy for several years. We used a condom and were careful and I never got it. Outside that relationship, I assumed every guy I slept with was positive and took the same precautions. Now I'm with a great guy who is also negative and in a loving relationship and I don't think about it anymore.  \n\nI don't think you can be happy in the closet with your family unless you're able to distance yourself in a way that I was never able to do. I came out when I was 19 and it was a struggle for my mother for 11 years. There were tears and manipulation and arguments but she never threw me out and supported me through college. Then one day she just suddenly changed and became the most supportive parent for both me and my bf that anyone could ask for. If your parents have something over you like supporting you financially than you probably can't risk coming out. But if you can, you might be able to regain that closeness that you probably don't have now. It probably won't happen overnight. Or in a year. If you're lucky, it will happen. Or it might not but at least you will have lived it on your own terms.\n\nI hope the message that things get better isn't lost. With the Internet, so many things seem easier but a lot of things seem harder. Meeting people seems harder today despite all of the chat rooms and websites. At least when I was 20, there was a gay bar in every city and a lot of them were pretty fun. There was always a place to go to meet people and connect with friends. Now it's all hook up sites and circuit parties --or have circuit parties gone away too?! \n\nI'd encourage anyone feeling isolated to pick up and move your ass to a city with an active gay community. That's what I did and it was the best thing I ever did. It doesn't need to be forever but it will give you a new perspective and open your mind up to the possibilities beyond the headlines. For a while I lived in a gay ghetto and almost could have forgotten that there was a straight person in the world. Today I live in a suburb and know only a hand full of gay couples in my town. \n\nMy advice is to shake this thing whatever it is. Do something new. Move to a cool new city if you're not already in one. Try coming out to your most trusted family member (he/she probably knows already).  Don't stick yourself in a box and let the news and common perceptions keep you down. Life is what you make it. There's a lot more out there than these small minded views but you have to get out there and see it for yourself.    \n\n",

High schools, Colleges, and cub scout troops they all have flags. \n\nEveryone as a group uses some sort of icon displayed on a flag as a means of showing what particular group they belong to. It's about recognition, it's about pride.\n\nEveryone feels comfortable with like minded people, this is a fact. This is even more true of the gay community at large. We tend to stick with one another because we share similar histories and interests. We bond as a group because around one another we can feel free to be ourselves and talk about things that we want to talk about, freely and openly, without having to self edit.\n\nI have heterosexual friends. I have more heterosexual friends than I do gay friends. These friends are very open to me, they know who I am and what I am. They know my other half and they welcome him with open arms. But, I still have to self edit. I can talk as freely with them as they do with me because their considered \"the norm\". \n\nThey don't understand that, some of the things they talk about regarding their personal lives gross us out as much as it would them if we talked about the same in ours.\n\n\nAll of the posts that you see here recently about the tragic deaths of the 7 teens who committed suicide, the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy and all of the other issues is simply because, we need to raise awareness of these issues. \n\nIt is not all bad being gay, not at all. We live our lives, we just are not content with having less rights than everyone else. We are not content with seeing people being bullied to a point where they feel the only way out is to end their own life. We are not content with having to work harder to be able to provide for our families because we can't make use of the system that we pay taxes into, just like our heterosexual counterparts.\n\nBeing an \"out\" gay, is difficult. You don't always know who you can trust. But, it is essential in order to raise awareness and to further the cause of equality. It is essential to your own mental health that you are able to feel free to be yourself. \n\nWe all, each of us who live \"out\" lives, had to come to a point where we said \"fuck the world if they don't like me\". We had to decide for ourselves that we would be comfortable with it if our families and friends disowned us. \n\nYes, being gay is hard but then, so is being locked in a closet monitoring your every word and every action.\n",

It basically seems like it sucks to be gay, but hear me out...\n\nI'm in my late 20's, noticed that I had a thing for guys when I was 18. Tried to dating girls, but it turned out that Mr, Weewee  only worked with guys. What's weirder is that it's older guys, I wrote a IAmA about it [HERE!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/dkmz6/iama_26_year_old_male_who_just_got_out_of_a_5/) .   I don't associate myself with the LGBT or whatever community, and live my life according to me. I just find the gay culture, well too gay, or more of a giant support group.\nIf I paid attention to the local gay community, I'd probably end up being a twink hanging out flyer on the weekends.\n\nLook at all these stories posted on the front page of /r/LGBT, some girl hold a gay flag got beat up, then some teenagers committed suicide, and apparently it doesn't' get better when you get older, as mentioned in that Gen closet youtube video. It's almost like if you're gay when you'll get fucked either way. No pun intended. At work, or by friends, or family .etc\n\nI recently watch a documentary called \"The Butch Factor\", which is about guys that I feel I most identify with. One of them even mentioned that saw beer bottle being thrown at feminine gay guys. Even some of the butch guys in the video were disowned by their families. Yea I know that doesn't happen to everyone and some families are more accepting, but still it's a risk and can go either way. \n\nAs for myself, being gay,  I did figure out were I fit in most and what I have to do to achieve happiness. I'll never tell my family, they're too religious, and old friends just seem like they have questions which I myself don't know the answers to.\n\nOne last thing is, I have two big fears about being gay, one is AIDS, and two is dieing alone.\n\nI'm not try to bash anyone, but it just seems to me that it's just some sob story after another. Anywho, I'm open to comments and advice. :)\n\n\nEdit: Oh forgot to mention... All gay people want equal right, that cool, yet they separate themselves from everyone else, you even have your own flag! \n\nEdit2: I forgot to mention High School. I remember people calling me gay in HS, but this was way before I even knew I was gay, so it didn't really bother me that much. However it did keep me from fitting in with the cool kids, and I do feel like I was robbed of some of the HS experiences. Had a GREAT experience in college though. :) So fuck those losers they're all bagging groceries now.",

Physical attraction is only important in context and, in my opinion, belongs in the private drawer. Ask yourself why heteronormative societies are so obsessed with genetalia itself that they teach people to reduce other people to it. What repels me about the whole topic is the one-dimensionality of people normatively divided into 2 obvious drawers, that's a lazy thought approach. You can easily have your sexual preferences and let others have their sexual preferences without them having to overlap. Just because a woman is a lesbian doesn't mean she has to find all women attractive. You need a partner with pussy, find a partner with pussy but be polite about it. Just because I don't like something doesn't mean it shouldn't exist or that it affects my existence in any way. You may have the impression that the T is a bit louder than the other letters, but that's because their human rights are more endangered in relation to G or L in many countries. If the alphabet soup were an ecosystem, some species would be slightly more endangered than others. Even worse if you accidentally got more letters than one. With a little recognition everyone gains more social acceptance and quality of life. No one is forcing you to fuck someone you don't find physically and emotionally attractive. If you find yourself in the statistically unlikely position that a lesbian woman you don't find physically attractive will make you a clear offer, you can respectfully decline it and you both can continue to coexist peacefully.",

You're exploring, so feel free to let a label like bisexual be relatively loose. and if someone were to ask you, tell them you're still figuring it out if they are prying that difficultly into your psyche. \n\nBecause after all, society is in a position of accepting and trying to understand gender identities, yet no one has really worked in talking about how we then address the idea of orientations. Like saying \"gay, lesbian, straight\" are all orientations that include ALL attractions. But we all have different kinds of attractions. Like we all prefer different body parts on people: some people go for face, some butt, some legs, etc.\n\nDon't feel pressured to label yourself so strictly. Gender identity, expression, and orientation are ALL on a spectrum. Not a line continuum, but more like one of those circular color wheels, maybe with a couple points so we can find those outlying labels.\n\nAnd I don't want you to think you're going to do the same thing, but in high school, I had a hard time imagining a future with a male partner. I could imagine a future with a wife and such. It might be because of visibility in media/role models/etc. so those ideas could change in a few years.\nI honestly have the hardest time picturing a future, but that's also cause I don't feel like I have a solid career path to start laying foundation in my life.

I know I'm not alone with this kind of stuff.

If that's how you express yourself, and that is your expression of your gender and you are confident, then that is great, you should be comfortable being yourself. BUT, the comment \"if you're gay, celebrate it, don't limit it\" suggests that in order to express yourself, you have to do so in a stereotypical way. That's stupid. If I don't act \"stereotypical\" it isn't b/c I'm ashamed of being gay or am hiding a part of my \"true\" personality, it's because my true personality doesn't align with stereotypes. That shouldn't matter, but the pressure from the community to \"conform\" to expectations that the media sets up and that many internalize is not good for the self esteem of those who don't fit into those standards.\n\nI've ranted way too long, but idk this is still a kind of sore spot for me.",

Slowly expose yourself to the things you fear so you can grow to understand it, rather than going off of what is comparatively a hunch.\nI wish you the best of luck in combating your fears.",

If anything, where I grew up homophobia was taught as sin (which it should be). I have gay uncles and gay cousins, my family is very liberal and accepting of people. The priests and deacons that my church has had all support the LGBTQ+ community, and sometimes make an effort to talk about it in their homilies. So it deeply saddens me to hear about homophobic Catholic groups and people who were mistreated, attacked, and discriminated against by Catholics/christians/religious people.\n\nThe unfortunate part is that you\u2019ll never know how many people from those religions actually are nice people and are accepting because the ones who speak up the most are the homophobic ones. I\u2019ve only met one homophobic priest. After a deacon (who is like a second father to me) gave a homily with explicit discussion of the LGBTQ+ community and acceptance (not tolerance.), the guest priest took him aside after mass and said he shouldn\u2019t do that. To which the deacon and other people all got very mad. Needless to say that priest was never invited back to our church.\n\nSo you are right to be fearful, there are bad people in any group. But as someone who is Catholic, please don\u2019t take you frustration out on the groups as a whole. From my experience there are more accepting people than homophobic ones, though it probably does depend on where you\u2019re from.",

I've encountered homophobia several times in London, usually from people who are new to the country and its honestly scary. \n\nJust as context, one of these experiences was holding my boyfriend's hand at a bus stop at night. Suddenly a man driving past stops and gets out his car, he shouts at us for holding hands and threatens us then drives off. We were both so scared, and you just can't react in a situation like that becuase he could of had a knife or who knows.\n\nSo is it bad to be scared? I'm not a judgemental person and I'm generally really open minded and friendly, but I'm scared so much in public becuase I hate conflict. \n\nAnother price of context would be my best friend's boyfriend, who is a devout Muslim and has openly said he tolerates gays but it's against his religion and he wants nothing to do with me, or to be near me at all. I felt so offended, my best friend was annoyed but she dosent seem to see how hurtful it was to me.\n\nJust all these things make me feel so unhappy and I'm sure there's others feeling the same way out there \n\nSo am I in the wrong?",

Now, why are you so angry at the gays who behave like that when it is, in fact, the fault of the uninformed and uneducated who should expose themselves to more gay people before forming a misinformed idea about them?\n\nAnd, yes, they really do.

I have sex with many women, I kiss in public, and often go out, get smashed, and have random anonymous sex with willing women.  Am I giving heterosexual males a 'bad name' by sleeping with random females?  Does my behavior reflect badly on the entire male heterosexual populace?  Just some food for thought.\n\nIf your answer is like mine, which is that \"no, it doesn't\", maybe you would be better served by being angry with the people who seem to demand that you conform to a stereotype, and less with the gay people who're doing their own thing and, quite frankly, having a great time.\n\nA side note:  marriage has never been about sex.  You don't need to be married to have a ton of sex.  Furthermore, marriage is -also- not about love.  You don't need to be married to be wildly, unconditionally in love with someone and wake up next to them every morning for the rest of your life.  Marriage is, and in my opinion, always has been, about the rights and privileges of married couples:  from tax benefits to visitation rights to next-of-kin to the ability to make medical decisions for the other to etc.  Saying it's about love or sex is a misunderstanding of the issues involved and kind of short sighted.",

Which type you get depends on which one you go to.\n\nAnd the whole point of all of them, is yes to celebrate specifically those aspects of queer life that have been treated like shit by dominant heterosexual society.  Sexuality isn't the only one (our families, religions, histories, cultures, etc), but it's a really big one.\n\nThe whole world is set up to celebrate heterosexuality, straight sex and straight sexual relationships.  Proms and weddings and baby showers, Marti Gras and Mother's Day, we're only now just starting to be included in these celebrations, and their tradition and still dominant purpose is the public celebration of how natural, right and awesome heterosexuality is.\n\nSo following the lead of many other marginalized groups, parades and similar events get organized.  They're a public celebration of everything about a community that it finds valuable but which generally is treated like shit.  Different parades and different contingents within parades celebrate different aspects.  A parade to celebrate our families and children isn't going to have the same vibe as a parade to celebrate the awesomeness of gay sex.  It's Mother's Day vs. Marti Gras; we can have both.  And neither is a bad thing.\n\nAnd a parade isn't forcing anything on anyone.  It's just a celebration.  You don't have to like them, you don't have to go to them, but why piss on their party?",

They'll look for dramatic costumes and the handful of naked people.\n\nSt. Patrick's Day has nothing to do with sex, but pictures will find people in sparkle wigs and painted green nipples.  ",

And maybe they even spontaneously encountered some, too.  You might encounter random mild sexytime any time you wander through NYC in the summer.  Last September I got stuck in traffic behind the Brooklyn West Indian Pride Day parade, and the costumes were both *amazing* and no less revealing than those of Gay Pride Day.  Attractive people wearing nothing but elaborate feathers.  Google \"Brooklyn West Indian Pride Day\" for comparison.\n\nAnd honestly, \"My friend from Canada who isn't here totally told me it was a crazy huge public orgy\" isn't really a great source of information.

An elderly nun walked with a local Episcopalian congregation.\n\nSmall town Pride events too - New Paltz NY's parade is small but festive, and about as crazy as the Apple harvest festival.  New Hope Pennsylvania's parade is touristy but adorable.  Seriously, if you're finding this kind of debauchery, it's because you went looking for it.\n\nAnd yea, I'm sure if you look hard enough, you'll find some stories of public debauchery.  If we're talking major city parades, we're talking about a *massive public event.*  There's going to be some debauchery, especially if you are trying to find it.

I disagree with the personal actions of these people, not their sexuality in any way/shape/form.\n\nNow, does this make me a homophobe?\n\nEdit: Indeed, go right ahead and keep downvoting me for fighting the opinion that marriage is about sex. Does the LGBT community honestly feel marriage is only there so you can have sex and sleep on an easy conscious?\n\nReally?\n\nIf I want to marry my boyfriend, it will be because I love him unconditionally and with all my heart. It means I want him to be there with me every morning for the rest of my life.\n\nIf the consensus of /r/LGBT is \"Marriage is for sex\", then I'm sadly going to have to start protesting against gay marriage.

What I\u2019m asking is that you hear me out, \n\nI\u2019ve been reading around on this forum (and a couple others for LGBT related topics), and interestingly I feel like the majority of LGBT people actually don\u2019t love Pete, which honestly really threw me for a loop. There are several reasons that people don\u2019t like him, but from what I\u2019ve seen here (and don\u2019t get me wrong, there are certainly other reasons) a lot of people feel like he\u2019s gay, but not gay enough. He rarely does a ton of stuff with his husband that ends up getting televised, and his views on LGBT rights haven\u2019t been exceptional compared to that of any other candidate. He hasn\u2019t spent a whole lot of time pushing for the LGBT community, and he ultimately just doesn\u2019t really make it all too clear that he\u2019s gay unless you do a more research than what you see on the nightly news. Look no further than the video of the woman who had no idea she was voting for a gay man until after she voted. \n\nI\u2019m no expert on Pete, but I\u2019ve been following him since pretty close to when he made his announcement that he would be running, so I\u2019ve been following him for what seems to me to be ages. Unfortunately, the bottom line of it is this: there are too many bigots and too few lgbt people in to run on a platform that pushes heavily for lgbt activism. The unfortunate truth is that about 28 percent of Americans oppose same sex marriage, while only 4.5 percent are lgbt. Don\u2019t misunderstand me, I\u2019m not thick enough to think that those bigoted people aren\u2019t mostly in the republican field anyways, or that there aren\u2019t more people that really care about lgbt issues than just lgbt people themselves. At the end of the day though, there are just things that will lose approval before getting into office, and unfortunately making it clear that he\u2019s gay won\u2019t help it a ton. \n\nNow let me say, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s trying to hide it. He\u2019s not pretending to be straight. But I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all been in situations where it\u2019s simply easier to just not talk about our sexuality, even if the topic comes up. I think that\u2019s Pete\u2019s strategy as it pertains to his sexuality.\n\nI know full well there are other factors that make people not like him, and I also know that identity politics can be a slippery slope, but I want you to imagine just for a moment a world where America, the country that\u2019s supposed to lead in progressive politics, has a gay president. In fact, not only a gay president, but a gay president who is married to a man, and the president of a country where being married to the same sex was legalized less than a decade before his presidency. That\u2019s a statement that matters, not just to the rest of the world, but to the children that we all once were, hiding in the shadows of shame that we thought was necessary in knowing our sexuality or gender, and not being able to tell it to the world. Imagine how this could change the lives of the next generation. And now think about what all of that would look like if all we had was another old white man in office.\n\nI know a lot of people don\u2019t like him, and frankly I understand why, but the reality is that there\u2019s not a candidate on any debate stage that hasn\u2019t said or done bad things. The truth for Pete is that his potential to do bad things has been pretty low, and it\u2019s quite a big risk to take, to let a mayor handle the United States (even if he does have more executive experience than the sitting president). All I\u2019m asking is that instead of looking at the instances where he screwed up, or even where you disagree with him, look at the values that he makes prominent throughout his campaign, and consider what they mean to you. \n\nI think this country needs Mayor Pete as the president, and if your candidate doesn\u2019t make the mark, or you feel like your vote doesn\u2019t count because of where your candidate sits, consider giving the first gay man to run for president your vote.",

I advised earlier that if you're a gay conservative to only vote for Republican candidates when their views on gay rights issues are no different from their Democratic opponents (you see this in congressional and Senate races more often), but to otherwise abstain from voting.\n\nThat said, I really do think the Republicans are beginning to moderate themselves on gay issues. It's true all of these things are matters of faith for the leading figures in the party, but they don't talk about these issues in speeches as much or in television ads to the same degree as they did in 2004, which was probably the worst year I remember for homophobic rhetoric. It was much more blatant. Now Rick Santorum, a marginal candidate, is the only one making social conservative issues central to his campaign. Indeed, the front-runner, Mitt Romney, said he was opposed to gay rights during the last debate, but then questioned John King, the CNN anchor and host, and asked him why he asked such a question when the country needed to be focused on more important things like the economy. Many of the candidates' websites have been scrubbed of these issues as well.\n\nWe're also seeing more Republicans in state houses and senates (like in New York) breaking with their party on gay marriage, and seeing more endorse civil unions. We've also seen GOProud, a gay conservative group, featured prominently at the last CPAC, even receiving the endorsement of red meat ideologues like Ann Coulter. And this is much to the distaste of the party's far right.\n\nI can imagine in 10 years the Republicans to become a party associated with gay men -- you know, more than they already are ;-). It might take longer. But we've seen a similar phenomenon in Europe where as gays became increasingly visible (and therefore a market to be exploited by politicians), conservative parties began appealing to them, and in some countries now carry a majority of gay votes. As it is, gay men tend to have more money than straight people generally (though I've heard this might be a myth), and so are more likely to distrust socialist economic policies.",

Opposing all the major gay rights reforms of our day: DOMA repeal, DODT repeal, anti-bullying, anti-hate crime, and anti-discrimination legislation - these are all absolute matters of faith for virtually all leading figures in the Republican party.\n\nAs I said, I understand the desire not to want to be defined by ones sexuality if one is in other aspects quite conservative. However, people need to decide if their desire to pay less taxes or see society at large change more slowly is worth the entrenchment of their status as second-class citizens. I think that's an unwise decision. I think it's hard for anyone queer in a marriage, especially with children, to think it a wise decision - especially when one has to choose if one's attitude towards the economy or foreign affairs is more important than being able to visit your partner in hospital if they get sick or being recognised as the legal parent of your own children if it gets challenged.",

There's really a huge distinction between rape/sexual assault and a situation where two individuals in a sexualized context (i.e. jerking off together) where someone reads the context wrong. It would definitely be sexual assault if the person who did not feel comfortable going further was resisting and the other person was not taking 'no' for an answer. However, if you really think the appropriate FIRST response to someone trying to go down on you after you were masturbating together is to beat the shit out of them, then you really have no grasp of proper social conduct. The person who called in allowed for a sexualized context to occur; the appropriate response would be to say 'no' if you did not want it to go further. This wasn't a context of some guys just randomly sitting around and one of them just tries going down on the other.   ",

I firmly took hold of her wrist, took her hand out of my jeans, and said \"no thanks\" and turned away. Should I have turned round and punched her in the face instead? ",

As the movement matured, we came to understand that one big factor in that oppression was the pervasive notion that gay people should be ashamed of ourselves.   So one of the ideas behind gay pride was to combat internalization of that in ourselves.  So no, it wasn't about pride in gayness _per se_, it was simply proud of being who we are, not because we're but in spite of being gay. ",

Gay people aren't actually PROUD of being gay, persae, but they're fighting a society that still undervalues them, and even (among some) thinks they're evil. The concept of Pride is meant to counteract that. So the aim may be superiority, but the actual goal is equality.\"",

They tend to prompt informative and intelligent discussion about the history of the LGBT movement and the overall connections between gender and sexuality, which I think educate and inform a lot of people who would otherwise have been unaware of it. I do wish people would do a search before remaking the same post, though.\n\nAnd you're right, the \"tranny\" conversations are not inherently more offensive than the \"gay\" (as a pejorative) and \"faggot\" ones, yet only one group is up in arms about them. Generally, it feels like they're against real discussion of gender and trans* issues because they're too intent on finding \"transphobia\" in posts that are not actually malicious or bigoted. As such, I'm not convinced that the \"rampant transphobia\" that they claim is the basis for this entire situation actually exists. Every time I ask for evidence of upvoted transphobia, nobody will give me any examples. It doesn't seem any more prominent than biphobia, which SilentAgony effectively defended.\n\nPersonally, I have never had anything whatsoever against trans people - but before coming to reddit, I simply did not know the reasons for them being grouped in with the LGB, as it's not necessarily an intuitive connection or about exactly the same things. Nor did I understand the effect of the word \"tranny\" until reading the experiences of trans people on reddit. If I had seen blatant and growing transphobia on r/lgbt, I would be right with them demanding that things change - but of course, the red flair was a stupid method of doing this.\n\nI agree with almost every point in your comment on r/transgender, but I got banned for saying less than that, so I don't know how you can manage there.",

The asker, in that case, was much more offensive about asking than you are, so good for you. As for me, it might be something about being attracted to men at a basic level, or... I don't know, sometimes I feel like certain butch women have a combination of confidence and vulnerability that just makes me weak at the knees... like I say, I'd be stupid to try to psychoanalyze it, though.

The phrase \"dopey cunt\" could easily be replaced with \"you dope!\". Plus we're all aged 18-21, it's possible that you're older and this is a generational thing. \n\nIf you watch Skins you'll notice this sort of thing going on (I can't think of a concrete example) but when I'm with my friends we regularly use language that would make a fishwife blush. This was driven home the other day when I swore at my Russian friend (who I regularly make jokes with along the lines of \"Oh, have you lost weight? I guess you've had another abortion!\" \"LOL yeah your Dad needs to start wearing protection whenever I come over to visit\") and she was shocked. She says English swearwords are a lot milder than Russian ones.\n\nWe're the sort of people who read Sickipedia. But the point is, with insults the intonation is what matters. A friend could call me a dopey faggot and I wouldn't get offended (maybe if they did it a lot I'd get a bit pissed off) but if a random stranger came up to me and called me a pervert, which isn't even a swear word, and said it in a clearly demeaning and aggressive way, well my hackles would rise.\n\nIt's all about context.",

The words slut, whore and bitch are words with negative connotations, this is not a matter of acceptance, nor is it a matter **defined** by sexuality. \n\nEDIT 1: I want to be clear, though this can be hard to articulate. I'm bothered because it seems like the individual has self image issues (whether from being gay or some other reasons) and to combat those self image issues, they use derogatory and demeaning terms. They pick terms that when used to describe someone of their gender who fits into the window of \"normal\" would be offensive (calling a guy \"girl\", calling a friend \"whore\", etc.). It's extremely transparent in most cases that they are trying to overcompensate for lack of self esteem in some areas. At least to me that's what it seems like. In addition, their choice of reaction to their low self image not only makes THEM look bad, but is used to blanket the entire gay population with a negative connotation. In 2011 the gay world, even though it shouldn't be, is considered one community. It bothers me that this has become a norm. It's disrespectful, looks bad, and makes others, like myself, look bad as well, whether we participate with the craze or not. ",

Jim lives in Missouri, so I'm worried that it will be tough convincing him, and others have already tried with open letters, etc.  https://twitter.com/longshotauthor?lang=en\n\nHere is my story:\n\nJim's books saved my younger brother's life.  My little brother, who is gay, was depressed for a long while and happened to read some of Jim's books, got hooked, and started to engage more in life.\n\nThen a very horrible thing happened.\n\nHalfway through the series, my younger brother discovered that his favorite author was, well, not as gay friendly as my younger brother thought.\n\nWithout repeating the reasons why, here are some quick links to illustrate the issue.\n\nhttps://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?727060-Dresden-Files-Dresden-Files-poor-trackrecord-with-Sexism-Racism-and-Diversity\n\nhttps://vaughndemont.com/2013/12/30/an-open-letter-to-jim-butcher/\n\nhttps://arsmarginal.wordpress.com/2012/12/14/the-new-dresden-files-book-i-cant-be-the-only-person-who/\n\nMy baby brother is now all depressed again.  He doesn't know if it's the author or just his books or that it even matters, he just feels BETRAYED.\n\nI would like to get Jim to do something similar to how Bruce Springsteen boycotted North Carolina (awesome!) or somehow show some support.  But I'm probably in the minority of Jim's fanbase, and definitely in the minority on /r/dresdenfiles.\n\nFYI, my post in that subreddit /r/dresdenfiles has been downvoted to heck, just for bringing up the issue.  But I refuse to be ashamed of standing up for and trying to help my little brother.  https://www.reddit.com/r/dresdenfiles/comments/4e1nwg/should_jim_butcher_boycott_north_carolina_because/\n\nThank you all in advance for your help, guidance, wisdom, and support!\n\nEdit:  Here's a summary of Jim's views on LGBT issues, about halfway down.  According to this person, Jim \"has no problem with gay guys as long as they're not \"doing whatever they do\" in front of him; he has no opinion on if homosexuality is \"right or wrong\" but then goes on to compare it to drinking, smoking, etc; and he also throws in a dash of generic slut-shaming to boot.\"\n\nhttp://ilaeria.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-dresden-files-book-series-review.html",

Surprised? How does it make you feel? Stats can be great to bring attention to a topic but they can also be used to manipulate a story. Our survey found that 72% of gay men didn\u2019t use a condom the last time they had sex. But, what kind of sex were they having? When we asked about anal sex we got a better picture:\n\n>**32% of the gay men who topped did not use a condom the last time they had sex.**\n\n>**37% of the men who bottomed did not use a condom the last time they had sex.**\n\n>About two thirds of the men in our survey did use a condom the last time they had anal sex. So what about the ones that didn\u2019t use condoms? 50% of these men had sex with either a long-term boyfriend or their husband or civil partner. A further 20% was sex with someone they were dating or had sex with on a regular basis. It won\u2019t be that in every case they would know each other\u2019s HIV\u00a0 status (or be right about it) but in many cases they would, including some couples were both partners are already living with HIV.\n\nPlease don't spread this kind of misinformation. It's pretty disgusting.\n\nEdit: To mods: would it be possible to get a \"Misleading\" tag on this post?",

And bringing that point up in a discussion about gay marriage only hinders the progress of equal rights for gays. It's a deflection of the real issue. Whether or not marriage\u2014assuming equal marriage opportunities for gay and lesbian couples\u2014is a system that fundamentally works, it's bound to be around for a long time. And it has plenty of benefits. So for now, let's fight for equal rights.\n\nEDIT: Whoever is downvoting my posts, can you at least post a comment reply to explain why?

Just like the illegality of interracial marriage until the 1960s, it's another barrier to overcome in terms of institutional and social discrimination (in this case, against gays).

It's called \"marriage\". Why go through the trouble of creating a completely separate system when you can modify the current one? It already provides plenty of legal and monetary benefits. The burden lies on society\u2014including you\u2014to strip marriage of the \"connotations\" you mentioned. Until that happens, we can at least allow gay and lesbian couples to experience the legal and monetary benefits of marriage as it exists today.

It will also help make gay partnership, and gay people be taken more seriously as a whole as part of societal acceptance. \n\nEven if I were to not wish to participate in gay marriage myself I wouldn't disallow others to move to the front of the bus too, that's an option they should have.

              "body": "Here, is the funny thing.  The reason that marriage is a state controlled institution is that churches couldn't keep it straightened out.\n\nLet's go through some history of marriage shall we?  \n\n2000 years ago, marriage was largely a matter of private concern with little involvement of religion.  There were a few small ceremonies, but largely a process of simply turning legal responsibilities of the woman to the husband.  There of course were dowrys and agreements.\n\nLater the Christian church decided that one should be married in the eyes of God.  There was no formally laid out ceremony, and quite often it simply came down to just saying \"we are married.\"  As time went forward parental consent became involved to ensure that there was no exploitation of the children (outside the obligatory royal wedding for power).  The Church was not under any obligation to record the marriage in its records, though that was done.  The state had absolutely NO role in marriage, and any issues of divorce, annulment, adultery, etc. went to an ecclesiastical court.  As Christianity spread and grew along side of social progress in the wake of events such as the Black Death, the obligation of parental consent faded away and there were less and less arranged marriages.\n\n\nNow we come to the Protestant Reformation.  Martin Luther felt marriage was a worldly thing and not truly of the kingdom of God, so in Protestant states such as Switzerland and some Germany Principalities  the state took over the legal obligation of marriage.\n\nOnly after this event in the Counter-Reformation did the Catholic Church require churches to record and mandate marriage in the eyes of God and the Church.  \n\nNow, this country, being descended from England almost directly in its laws, has the Church of England to thank for our views on marriage.  Before the Marriage Act of 1753, the Church of England required a Bann, or marriage declaration to be made before one could be marriage in one of the parishes that the two parties resided in.  However, this was not obligatory and did not render any marriage not performed in this manner void (I know, confusing right?)  The only full obligation of the law required that the ceremony be performed by an Anglican priest.  That is what made the marriage a legal one...Anglican consent.\n\nWhy was this required?  To prevent what was called \"Fleet Marriages.\"  This was largely to prevent clandestine marriages, for such reasons as bigamy (A wife in every port), lack of parental consent, and the requirements of fees to the clergymen meant that they would do it for a kickback.  The numbers of these Fleet Marriages were absolutely enormous.  The interesting thing is, is these were not meant to be fly by night quickies, but meant to be long term unions.  \n\nThis law basically ended these clandestine marriages and combined state law which recognized common-law marriage, and ecclesiastical law.  Essentially requiring a bann to be issued so the state could recognize it and have a paperwork trail.\n\n\nWhat does this all mean?  It is just another thing show that the divorce of religion/spirituality/ceremony and social values from the law is not that easy.  Yeah, we could do civil unions.  But here is the funny thing.  In the US they are all civil unions carried out in a ceremony either performed by a Justice of the Peace or a Priest.  Both must sign documentation and file that paperwork.  It's the aspect of the ceremony. \n\nIt's the idea of joining with another person in the eyes of either a God/Gods, your community, your family, your society, your other.  Ceremonies lend a legitimacy, a sort of \"this is real\" aspect to it.  Filing for a piece of paper and spending 30 minutes at the courthouse quite often doesn't have the same emotional and psychological impact as say; a huge cathedral, or beach at sunset, or park in front of a waterfall.  It's the ceremony and always has been.  \n\nWe have tied that ceremony to the word marriage, and as much as some of us would like to just say \"FUCK IT, ITS JUST A WORD.\"  Then why get pissed about the word faggot or nigger or kike or something?  It's selectively choosing what words you want to devalue, and attempting to remove what emotional impact it has.  Faggot is a hurtful word.  Marriage is a solemn word.  It carries the history of thousands of years of tradition in our minds and the idea that you are committing yourself to another person to a higher ideal be it a God or just the people you love enough to invite.\n\nSo no.  Saying fuck it, marriage doesn't mean anything is like saying that oaths of office, oaths against perjury, oaths that are legally binding have no value because they mean nothing because they are just words and actions.\n\nWell that's what we are, speaking, thinking, and acting creatures.  We associate certain actions with value and words with value no matter how much we want to think we are completely rational.  If you think otherwise.  Screw the ceremony of standing in line and just butt in at the front next time you are at the theater and see how well just saying ceremonial actions that have no real value works out for ya.",

              "body": "I can't tell if you're trolling or serious, but answering your questions correctly can't hurt:\n\nAnal sex implies, as per the name, insertion into the anus. Just above the anus is the rectum, which doesn't hold feces until *just before a bowel movement*. Most of the time, the rectum is relatively clean--and, in fact, it's designed to be self-cleaning. Most people have what's called the \"rectal reflex\", which is where your body automatically responds to pressure/expansion in the rectum as a need to defecate, and it's why many people, particularly when first trying anal sex, experience a strong urge to shit as soon as the penetrative partner has entered.  Avoiding sex right before bowel movements helps ensure cleanliness, and any worries can be remedied by having the receptive partner douche beforehand or having the penetrative partner wear a condom.\n\nIf you find that your shits aren't well-formed and are leaving lots of fecal matter in your rectum, up the amount of fiber in your diet. Not only is a lot of fiber healthy for you, but it's essential to get quality, non-residew-leaving stools. Above the rectum is the lower colon, where you have a much greater chance at encountering feces, but penetrative anal sex really just knocks at the door of the colon, rather than playing around inside.\n\nTo address your specific questions about procedures, people have sex in very different ways. There isn't always a \"between doing each other\" or \"between fingering each other\" because both partners don't necessarily have to trade off being the penetrative partner. Some people don't have anal sex at all. Some people only penetrate using a toy such as a buttplug, and then engage in mutual masturbation. Most people I know are fine with beginning with oral and then moving to anal, but I don't know anyone (it doesn't mean that they don't exist, just that it's less common) that would go the opposite direction without some cleaning beforehand. Basically, people do what they're comfortable with and what they enjoy--that's what sex, any sex, is about. If the possibility of encountering minor amounts of feces creeps you out, then anal sex, regardless of your orientation, probably isn't for you. On the other hand, understand that many people, regardless of orientation, engage in anal play because it can be *very* pleasurable. There are plenty of nerve endings down there that can produce amazing sensations, and many straight males who don't have a latent phobia of being penetrated have discovered that prostate stimulation can greatly enhance the fulfillment of their sexual activities both alone and with women.",

I have been with transwomen (as they are not any less \"women\" than ciswomen) but don't want to get into that sort of topic, because it's a hot button issue for r/lgbt and has been discussed at length with great fervor.",

When you continue to read them, you continue to expose yourself to her ideas- ideas you didn\u2019t even notice when you first read them as a child. They\u2019re insidious and dangerous. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to continue reading her books that\u2019s your call, but you better be making sure you know what you\u2019re reading. It\u2019s not enough to just say \u201cI acknowledge that the author is problematic\u201d. You need to be super aware for yourself what you are exposing yourself to so you don\u2019t become infected. \n\nHere a few insidious bigoted plot lines in the story\n\n\nShe didn\u2019t make any of her characters gay in any of her books.\n\n-lets start with transphobia. Rita Skeeter was a trans coded character who illegally turned into a disgusting creature to spy on children and go places where she wasn\u2019t allowed. Does this sound like transphobic propaganda? It is. (Rita was described as having a large square jaw, thick \u201cmanly\u201d hands, and dressing incredibly gaudily with the most obvious fake nails and fake teeth and fake hair and fake everything.)\n\n-racism feels like a good next stop. I feel like this one should be obvious but the house elves were an enslaved, subhuman race who were slaves. In fact they WANTED to be slaves. The one character who protested against slavery was treated like an idiot for this. Is this racist propaganda? Totally. Did many children not even realize the implications as they laughed at Hermoine\u2019s dumb little initiative? Yes and that\u2019s the problem\n\n\n-antisemitism, and this Obed very personal. Did you ever think about how the goblins, who ran the banks and were greedy, and subhuman, and sneaky also had hooked noses. Do you recognize antisemitic propaganda when you see it? In the movies did you notice the Jewish star on the floor of gringotts? Like me, did you hate the goblins when you read the books the first time, just some questions to ask\n\n-Serophobia (discrimination against people with hiv/aids) and homophobia: you may not have heard, but JK Rowling announced to fans that lycanthropy was a metaphor for hiv/aids. Si here we have this disease-most famous for its affect on the gay community-that in her book turns you monstrous. But the real clincher is that she had one infected person infect children on purpose. This plays so obviously into the idea that gay men prey on children. It\u2019s disturbing and disgusting \n\nHaving said all that, I would like to repeat that what you read is your choice and you don\u2019t need to justify it to me. I don\u2019t care what trash you decide to read. But you better be paying close attention to what you\u2019re putting in your brain and heart. Are you sure you want this woman in there?\n\n\n(Side note: Because we are talking about whether it\u2019s ok to read HP I will not go through every issue in FBAWTFT and the more surrounding it. But I promise it\u2019s awful. From it\u2019s treatment if Native American culture, to the fact that Voldemort\u2019s pet is an Asian woman??? And more)",

She has been harassing me in the IRC channel for the last hour.  It's really one of the most tiresome bans I've ever had the misfortune to give out, and, I think, one of the favorite strawmen that's going on right now.  I've offered over and over to remove her ban if she promises not to spam, but apparently she'd prefer to martyr and spread more cherrypicked screencaps.  \n\nAs for Laurelai's conduct, I can't speak for all of it.  I don't know what she did before reddit or outside of reddit or on twitter or whatever else.  I don't keep that close tabs on *anyone* not even my partner.  Frankly, most of the posts which literally had to have stalked her for years to compile left me with such a bad taste in my mouth I couldn't read them.  Who would investigate a person that hard?  Who would hate somebody *that* much?  Why does anyone here think that's acceptable?  \n\nSince beginning on reddit, I've acquired two such nutcases.  One who won't stop following me around and commenting about something I said over 2 years ago when I was struggling with coming out as gay, and one who has decided I have brainwashed rmuser.  As such, I am rather uncomfortable reading posts like that with so much effort put into them and I'm even more uncomfortable being held accountable for over five years of somebody *else's* life.  I think that's rather too much to expect from us.  \n\n**If there's a specific ban that needs challenging or specific behavior that seems unkind or something, we'll address it.  We always have, but you can't expect that it'll get the same publicity as the bad behavior or unpopular ban itself did.  Usually, when we resolve these things, it's quietly and in the modmail.**",

Imagine somebody told you that they had the right to come to a pride parade with some exodus international stuff about how it's better to be straight, then told you that wasn't homophobic because after all they hate the sin love the sinner.  In that case, you could tell them that *you* get to decide what's homophobic.  Now, it may have rubbed you the wrong way to be told that you don't personally have the authority to decide what is and isn't transphobic, but the fact is: if you're cis, you don't have persistent personal experience with hurtful things that people say to trans people.  You only see what comes up when you happen to pass by it on reddit.  Have you ever seen anyone beat up a homeless person?  I haven't, but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  I just don't spend a lot of time with homeless people.  In cases like this, it's useful just to listen.  Laurelai should not have engaged argumentatively in a conversation where she used her mod powers, but I would encourage you to listen to trans people when they tell you what's transphobic instead of stubbornly clinging to your right to tell them what is and is not transphobic.",

The marginalized group most certainly does NOT hold the only valid opinion on what is discriminatory or oppressive against them.\n\nHomophobia can come from gay people (look at all the [probably] closeted yet bigoted Republicans in the USA) and trans gender people are more acutely aware of, affected by, and knowledgeable of transphobia, but they certainly can still hold transphobic opinions and values themselves, just like how marginalized races can be racist.\n\nAnyways... I've also seen implications (and I believe the instance I'm thinking of was from RobotAnna, of all people) that transgender people don't have any real allies. Which, again, is extremely divisionary and pretty alienating for someone like me, who works with transgender people on a daily basis in my practice, and puts a lot of effort and time into combating oppression. Though I don't think anybody I've worked with would hold such a demeaning and dismissive attitude towards me (hopefully).\n\nUgh. This is all a very silly situation.",

I've been surprisingly upvoted on a lot of them I wouldn't expect on reddit, such as pointing out misogyny.\n\nWhen you just delete things and ban people, you lose the chance to educate the person on why they're wrong.

We had discussed taking a lighter, more friendly approach before Laurelai resigned and were sad to see her resign today, but whatever the case, that was the intent for the future of r/lgbt.  \n\nIt's difficult to give a short answer to this, but I'll do my best.  Unfortunately, it seems that people are often blind to transphobia.  I'll admit, even I used to be.  The only way I can really figure out whether something is transphobic even now is to replace all mentions of \"trans\" with \"gay\" and all instances of \"cis\" with \"straight\" to see if this would offend me.  Even then, I don't know whether everything I'm reading would necessarily trigger a trans person.  After all, my identity is not as often in question or considered pathology - at least not in this day and age.  We wanted somebody on board who would be able to identify these things and RobotAnna, with her activism, seemed qualified.  \n\nThis isn't about being more adversarial with the community.  Again, we're moving forward in an attempt to open more discussion.  We sort of tried to remove ourselves from it for a while after what happened a month ago, but we're re-entering it now.  If all goes as planned, we'll have a kinder, gentler r/lgbt in no time.",

To the Congolese \u2026 it seems odd that if one man gets fifty votes and the other gets forty-nine, the first one wins altogether and the second one plumb loses.  That means almost half the people will be unhappy, and according to Anatole, in a village that's left halfway unhappy you haven't heard the end of it.  There is sure to be trouble somewhere down the line.\"\n\nEdit:  Just to be clear, none of the mods are responsible for deleting the above comment.",

The \"modest proposal\" for example where Robotanna discusses how women are better than men is meant to be a satirical joke about gendering issues in the style of Jonathan Swift's essay about eating babies in Ireland (a satire about class issues).

A concession to show the community that you're past it, so we can *all* get past it.\n\nA major example: installing Laurelai as a mod was, as heavily implied by RMuser, an intentional slap in the face. Whatever one might think of her personally, making Lauerlai a mod was one of the defining factors that caused the split in the first place. I don't see much reconciliation happening unless that, at least, is redressed. And I don't think Laurelai stepping down and appointing Laurelai 2.0 as her successor is going to do it. Trading one instigator for another is no way to settle things.\n\nI won't comment on RobotAnna's personality, because I don't know her or know enough about her to really say much there. I've heard things (and seen screencaps) that make me worry, and Laurelai's endorsement of her makes me worry even more. But whatever the reason, it's well known that controversy surrounds her, just as much as it did (and does) Laurelai. And her confrontational behavior is also well known. If you want harmony, if you want real peace in this subreddit, you can't have a person like that in charge of things.\n\nObviously, none of us can demand you do anything. You've shown that quite clearly, several times. But you've also seen the fallout from that line of action, and you appear to be trying to correct it. So we can ask: you know this has been a huge sticking point for many people here, and many people who used to be here but left. Do you plan to do anything about it?",

In order for a safe space to exist and to have quality conversations, pruning of posts and posters that poison discussions is necessary, otherwise things go downhill quickly. \n\nI have some ideas and plans for more positive dialogue than what has been going on in the mod change announcement thread, and plan on executing them once things calm down a little bit (and I have some time to sit down and do it!) \n\nOverall I really see my job here more as a janitor than as some sort of monarchy.

It's kind of like in a debate. In a debate, your intention oughtn't to be to convince the other side, for that way will likely be fruitless. Rather, the goal should be to make a convincing argument for listeners who may be less certain in their opposition to your stance. I guess I kind of feel that deleting them only serves to hobble the conversation, rather than enhancing it.\n\nThat's part of why I took a considerable portion of my discussion to /r/ainbow. That and the fact that I felt that I had to censor myself, and never voice any objections to these kinds of things, for fear of being banned by Lauralei (she banned me from /r/asktransgender, despite being a long-time subscriber there with no issues, because I mentioned the controversy that was blowing about at the time when it seemed relevant, so, while the ban was eventually lifted after appealing to other moderators, I certainly felt my fears were justified).\n\n>For perspective: How many patient, loving evangelists would it take to convince you that your same-sex proclivities are absolutely wrong and you should give them up and make 10 babies for God?\n\nFor me, and I'm sure many others, it would have nothing to do with the quantity of evangelists, and far more to do with the quality of their arguments. I've yet to see even a vaguely coherent argument for that that in any way jives with reality, so I'm highly doubtful it would ever happen.\n\nP.S. Sorry about your apparent downvote-armed stalkers.

A lot of the perception of ainbow in that way comes from its beginnings as an alternative to lgbt and its moderation, which included removing obviously hateful material - not just transphobia, but also thoughtless comparisons of homosexuality to pedophilia and incest, and so on. In contrast, ainbow's moderation is minimal, and how such material is addressed is entirely up to the community.

It's just that there's more general awareness of LGB issues now, and prejudice against LGB people has finally begun to decline. That's why discussions on such topics are less likely to be chock full of ignorance - rarely do we need to go back to Gay 101.

Just because people don't agree with you or feel hostility from the things you say, it does not make them transphobic. They felt your expectations were intolerable from the result of your moderating style. This is what bothers me so much.

But it's that five percent that causes all this drama and in-fighting between the two groups. \n\nI don't find r/ainbow as a sanctuary supporting transphobic attacks or anything near the sort. They're another community who supports the respect, safety and equality of all people, just like how this one is minded in the same way. \n\nDon't be so hostile. Pushing people only makes them want to fight back. Stop banning things that don't agree with your point of view. If someone *is* saying something transphobic then by all means delete it. Please do, in fact. That shouldn't be tolerated and yet again that's something we all agree with. \n\nYou don't have to be gay to support gay rights or transexual to support transexual rights or be a woman to support woman's rights or basic human rights in general. \n\nThis is a huge community where people who've been bullied and attacked and have been shown discrimination in their life go to find support and friendship and hope.

That was our response to that - we weren't backing down on it. In retrospect, there were probably better ways to address that. Same with the Hitler flair - when the Nazi comparisons were flying furiously, we thought that was a bit excessive given that this is about subreddit moderation. Mocking flagrant Godwins isn't generally considered offensive.\n\nPersonally, I don't mind if people went to ainbow, and it seems to have absorbed a lot of people for whom abiding by the expectations of lgbt was intolerable. If they want a place where hateful/ignorant content, ongoing angry meta posts, and so on can proliferate freely, then they have a place.\n\nThe issue we ran into is that, contrary to what many might expect, transphobia and trans-ignorance were *not* reliably downvoted when they appeared. They don't become an exhibit of how downvoted these posts are. They were not serving as educational opportunities, but rather as agree-fests about how trans people are strange or dangerous or freaks or incomprehensible or politically unpalatable or expecting too much from society. There comes a point where endless patient education over basic things is something we should be able to move on from as a community. It would be rather challenging if, every day here, we were expected to explain slowly that gay people are like straight people, except they like the same sex instead of the opposite sex, and so on. Some things should pretty much be considered prerequisites when you come to the L, G, B, **T** community.\n\nThis isn't about removing people for not being \"politically correct\". It's about applying sensible standards of moderation to posts that exhibit hurtful and offensive assumptions about LGBT people. Some people really are just exhibiting curiosity in good faith, and yes, these people can be simply talked to and informed. Others clearly aren't open to this at all. It's a fine line sometimes, and we do our best to make the right decision under the circumstances.\n\nI don't agree that \"radical\" must be a bad thing. To be radical can mean adhering to certain standards, uncompromisingly. It's just important that those standards be good. I certainly wouldn't object to *radical* equality or *radical* inclusion. The only way \"radical\" can *inherently* be a problem is if it's defined and understood to mean only something so extreme as to be objectionable, in which case it would be simpler just to say \"bad\" instead - in which case objecting to it would be tautological, since bad things are bad.\n\nUltimately, we don't disagree with you.

In fact, I am fearful that I will be banned for writing this post - I should not feel that way.\n\nI'm a big manly poly cis-male who loves everyone. I've had to go through my own struggle against society and cultural views, and the lgbt community has been a big part of that. If I joined here today, I'm not sure I would be feeling the same way.\n\nLets get started with the outright attacks on the community by the moderators. There is a very popular screencap where rmuser suggests that instilling laurelai as a mod could have been simply to troll the community. She was let to run wild with no accountability at all. Instead of addressing our concerns, all of you mods changed your flair to \"literally hitler\" - which was a slap in the face to all of us, that you don't take our concerns seriously at all. So many people had an issue with Laurelai that the community split off.\n\nTo move forward, these are all things that the moderators need to address. A public apology would go a long way. Hopefully this thread can cover the big ones.\n\nModeration, bans, and censorship should never be personal. There should be a list of rules and community standards which everyone follows, including moderators. If something new becomes a problem, adjust the rules. Bans should only be given for people who break the rules, and these rules should be very clear. Nobody should ever have their post deleted for not being politically correct enough.\n\nLets make these rules very easy. A bullet list in the sidebar, and a link to a more expanded set of community guidelines which goes over these rules, and expands on them with some examples.\n\nThe first rule should be simple:\n\n* Love one another.\n\nThe original goal which started this mess is a noble one: ensure that lgbt-reddit a safe space for transfolk as well. I agree with those intentions, and this should be a safe place for *everybody*. Unfortunately what ended up happening was a very hot headed moderator got put into place with absolutely no accountability to anyone.\n\nA more appropriate way to address trans issues is through community education. Blatantly hostile trolling which crosses the line of the community standards should be removed, but otherwise, lets bring the community together to educate. Let this great community come forward and educate, even if it means pounding the same issues over and over every time there is a trans troll. But do it with love, not with vengeance.\n\nEven if a moderator removes a troll post, some people will have already seen it. Personally I think it's better to see how downvoted those posts become, and to see the responses given to that post. Reddit works, so let it work.\n\nI remember when I first joined the lgbt community, as a bisexual cis man. I now identify as pansexual and poly. I'd had a couple trans people who I had known, but I really didn't know much about the struggles individual transfolk have to go through on a daily basis. I didn't know much of the journey, the transformation, how to phrase certain questions, or the pronouns to use.\n\nI'll give a good example. When I was new to the community issues, somebody was having problems at work. I tried to emphasize, and I asked \"Do your coworkers know that you used to be a man?\" I look at that now and cringe. If I had been banned from the community for screwing up a pronoun or asking a question the wrong way, it would have hindered my education. I have several trans friends now who I love dearly.\n\nIn laurelai's resignation, she writes that \"my replacement is an even more radical transfeminist than me.\" This gives me zero faith that this community will return to feeling safe. \"Radical\" is not a term which should be associated with a moderator.\n\nThe bottom line is that you are losing great people from this community. The general feeling seems to be that we are part of a wonderful community, trying to love each other and get along - but up top is a little circle of people who do not represent us, or hear our voice.\n\nWe want moderators with cool heads, who follow reason instead of emotions, who make themselves accountable to the community.\n\nThis needs to be a place where everyone and everything should feel safe again: All genders, all identities, all sexualities, all orientations.",

Specifically, I feel like a place like this, that aims to be a safe space, needs to have a feeling that the moderation is leveled, respectful, but still accomplishing the goal of a place where everyone can feel welcome.\n\nI feel like this criticism mostly applies to you, SA, and Laurelai before she left us, and definitely applies to the RobotAnna that I've seen prior to her getting mod here. I can't find the quote at the moment, but I know on a few occasions you have said that you can't be asked to have a filter when talking to the users of this sub. I also know that I had sent modmail here during the drama fallout regarding RobotAnna and her language targeting and attacking cis people who frankly didn't deserve it. Laurelai responded to the aforementioned message stating that she's tell RobotAnna to stop, and if she failed to, she would remove her.\n\nRobotAnna also tends to be one of the people that seeks to incite drama and insults regarding the whole [/r/ainbow](/r/ainbow) sub. While there are certainly people on both sides of the argument who drive this drama, I don't feel that it is a good thing to have a moderator who actively participates in the garbage going on. I'm willing to forgive previous trespasses, as it's been shown that she's often been 'in character' when lobbying these attacks, however I'm still uneasy about her inclusion. Not to continue the piling on of RobotAnna, but she is still a mod of the sub [/r/killwhitey](/r/killwhitey), which while most likely a troll inciting subreddit, and (most likely?) not serious, it's still not something I'd be interested in seeing someone who is helping the mods here create a 'safe space' be a part of.\n\nWhile [/r/ainbow](/r/ainbow) gets a lot of flak for not moderating deeply ignorant and triggering language and arguments, the one thing they do really well is moderator interaction with their users. They may have decided to take a hands off approach in terms of using their ability to remove garbage, however most of the mods will generally respond with a well thought out and generally very helpful response. They seek to moderate by trying to create a space where things like homophobia and transphobia are eradicated by education and community respect. They respond to even the most hateful and personal of attacks with respectful language. If there's one thing I wish the three of you would take from the example they set, its this way of interacting with your users. A community lead by level headed respectful people breeds a community where that becomes the norm for all users. We might disagree on things, we might get mad at each other, but we shouldn't resort to petty personal attacks. I understand that there is a lot of garbage currently leveled at the mods here, but I feel like in order to change that you really need to adopt a different method of interacting with the community.\n\nBuild a community that fosters discussions, respect and genuine care for each other.

It seems the moderation has somewhat stepped away from the SRS approach, which is a good step.\n\n* On that note, I worry about the reasons for adding RobotAnna.  I don't know much about her, she may very well be an excellent moderator, but what I want in a mod is someone who will remove posts that are not suitable for this subreddit, ban trolls, politely but firmly tell peole if they're getting close to crossing the line, be fair, consistent, and strive to maintain a welcoming atmosphere for everyone.

For example, plenty of black people use 4chan, and I don't think they'd continue to go back if they were traumatized by ironic racism; but imagine if moot decided to create a rule where saying bad stuff about white people was banned, or more realistically, interracial threads were banned, then it'd be different.",

For example, during the 60s, MLK called for equal representation in the workforce, e.g. if a city is 1/3 black, it would make sense that 1/3 of the workers in that city should be black. Reversing the situation, if 1/3 of the city is white, then 1/3 of the workforce should probably be white as well. Treating them the same is not siding with the oppressor.

Repeated questions will be deleted to keep it orderly and easily read.  If all you have to contribute is \"you suck, step down\" or \"I like rmuser's videos,\" that'll be deleted as well.  Once a question has been answered, probably all we'll allow to remain is the original question and the answer from each mod.  If clarification is needed, we'll keep that in as well, but again we want to keep this readable.  This is NOT because we want to censor you, it's because we hope we can make it neat and plainly readable so we can stick it in the sidebar or something for future reference.  \n\nReady, Set, GO!!!\n\nEDIT:  You guys I don't get karma for this, it's a self-post, so it would be nice if you'd upvote so the whole community can see it and participate.  Thank you <3  I think it's going quite well so far.\n\n\n\n\n**EDIT2:  Okay, looks like it's time for us to go to bed.  I'm really quite pleased with the turnout.  I've gotten around to pruning some of the irrelevant stuff, but will probably just do the rest tomorrow.  \n\nTomorrow will be a big day:\n\nFollowing your suggestions, we will post community guidelines on the sidebar so everyone can feel like moderation is predictable and the rules are laid out.\n\nWe will begin keeping \"notes\" so to speak on everyone's ban, so that if they ask, we can refer to it.  No mysteries.  Again, there are less than 100 bans in the 3 years we've been around.  Over half of them are throwaway accounts with names like \"FAGGOTWATCH\" that came around to tell us we're gross.  There really aren't that many, but whatever comes up will have a note.\n\nWe will post some links to some 101 so that people with questions about trans people or gay people or whatever can be referred to that.  Hopefully this will deflect the responsibility from the community to \"educate\" people who come in with bigoted questions and we'll be better able to sort out the people who really want to learn from the people who just want to harass somebody.  \n\nThank you all for your input!  Everyone have a lovely night.\n\n<3 Silentagony, rmuser, and RobotAnna**",

There was this one girl, who I will call Jennifer, who was basically the ringleader of the group.\n\nI decided on my own to be a vegetarian when I was six, and still am to this day. One time, Jennifer and her group ganged up on me and forced me to eat a bag of beef jerky. They discovered that I'm a lesbian and that I had a secret girlfriend. They blackmailed me into eating the beef jerky, threatening to publicize my secret to everybody. I ate the beef jerky sobbing, while they laughed in my face the entire time. Then, they decided to share my secret anyway. This turned my life completely upside down, since I had very homophobic parents and lived in a homophobic community. I was subsequently kicked out of my parents' home at the age of 16, making me homeless. My girlfriend's parents were much more accepting and took me into their home; for this I am forever grateful to them.\n\nAfter high school, I put myself through college and have been leading a successful career since then. My girlfriend and I eventually married in Massachusetts in 2004, the exact year gay marriage was legalized there. Tragically, she died in a fatal car crash in 2015.\n\nAbout a year ago, I was walking down the street when a homeless woman asked me for change. I looked at her, and instantly recognized her face; it was Jennifer! Soon after, she recognized me as well; instantly I saw a look of dread on her face. I could tell by looking at her that she was probably a drug addict. I talked with her for a while, confronting her about what she did to me in high school. She was deeply ashamed.\n\nIn the alley right next to us, I noticed a small box which had rotten vegetables in it. There were some tomatoes and cucumbers, all completely covered in green, fuzzy mold. I told Jennifer that I will write her a check for $500 if she eats those vegetables in front of me. She reluctantly accepted the offer, presumably because she needed the money in order to buy her drugs. I started video recording the encounter with my phone, and she started eating the vegetables. She threw up after she was finished eating them. I then rescinded the $500, telling her that she is disqualified because she threw up. I laughed in her face one last time, and went on my merry way. At that time, it felt like justice has finally been served after all those years, and that gave me a sense of closure.\n\nYesterday, I was browsing through my phone looking at my old photos and videos. I saw the video that I took on that day, and then it suddenly hit me; I felt like a complete monster. I'm now starting to completely regret what I did to her.",

That is to say, if thousands of people, whether they be firefighters, or janitors, or redditors, were to engage in this experiment, the consequences of how the whole chooses would have far greater ramifications than simply the choice of one individual. In such a case, we would want to think in broader concepts such as \"equality\" or \"personal bias\", rather than dissect an individual's perspective on the experiment, which may very likely be the case, since the original premise does not specify. \n\nFeel free to correct me if I understood incorrectly, since my understanding of ethics is spongey, at best. Why would the solution to this problem be so obvious then? I understand the idea of \"equality\" that you're proposing, but I think I also find it unsettling and perhaps unrealistic. I feel as if we may make the same type of choices every day. I know this may sound stupid, but bear with me. Consider donations to charity. Some people do not donate at all, and perhaps we can compare them with the people who would let both the straight and the gay person die. For the others that make a choice, would you narrow it down to two charities that you know would both benefit best and equally from the donations you give, and at that point flip a coin to randomly allocate the donation? Or would you employ a similar type of \"personal bias\"? I'm not sure how either one perspective or the other would be more obvious.\n",

Does that make you a monster?\n\nSuppose that every year, thousands of firefighters nationwide are put in that situation.  Independently, each of them rescue thousands of white-skinned folks they identify with instead of the brown-skinned folks who are just too alien.  Is this wrong?  Are the individual firefighters to blame?  Is the firefighting system to blame for failing to educate them?\n\nNow let's suppose that thousands of people are given choice of whether an unknown gay or straight person dies.  You are one of the thousands of people.  Furthermore, the people making the decision are chosen on the basis of their perceived ability to make ethical and rational choices.  You believe that lives have equal weight, but let's say that you also believe you have a right to your preference.\n\nI would say the \"coin toss\" strategy indicates that you believe equality more strongly than you believe your preference has weight.

Unless someone can prove there was a brick on the first night, **that's why Marsha gets the title of the first brick thrown.**\n\nSlyiva was also most likely there the second night. Not on the first, but yes, the second. You make her sound like she wasn't shit. Guess what: they almost all did drugs back then, or prostituted themselves, did what they did just to survive daily life, commit crimes, be with criminals, that's how shitty it was back then for toeing out of the line. They would be in hospitals, regular and mental. They would fight, and yell, and cuss. They weren't classic supermen, but they were still heroes. Rough ones, but still.\n\nStorme **was** there on the first night, but was probably one of a few Lesbians who fought back, we don't know for sure if she was the one who said anything or did anything but react to a changing situation.\n\nAnd the participants, these people also quickly moved to form organizations to better support the community. Away from the Homophiles, who tsk-tsk'd at everything. Away from the mob. Away from even other groups that wouldn't support trans people. Marsha and Slyvia raised a stink later in their life against HRC and Empire State Pride Agenda and NYGLCC for nearly everything. Slyvia almost literally died telling Empire State to accomodate more Trans into their program and outreach. Gay Liberation Front, Gay Activists Alliance, Daughters of Bilitis, Radicalesbians, so on....\n\nYou forget also that the lingo changes. Transvestite *was* a term used for Transgendered people. They would all be lumped under Drag Queen and Street Queen and Transvestite. Some of them today still equate it with Transgenderism, or say Transsexual, or even 'Bisexual' in the NB sense. Not everyone updates their lingo automatically, even today elders might sound a bit off. But look to their actions later: they lived until the 90s, the 00s, people now talked to them. They could almost all be lumped under being Transgendered; or a weird sort of mix. STAR definitely helped transpeople throughout its life. \n\nNot everything is so neatly organized and cataloged, especially not from a mix of drunk teens pushed to the edge of society and abused by the mafia, the police, the johns, the religious commuity, the city government, the whole of cishet society then.\n\nAnd finally - we were ALL there. Black. Latino. Gay. Lesbian. Transgender or Cis who just got into Drag. Bisexual guys or gals who could dip out and pass back with 'normal' society - though some finally got gumption and cheered people on or helped or even fought back. Jackie was there. Zazu was there. Storme. Marsha. Slyvia. Tammy. Craig. Danny. Griffin. And dozens to hundreds of others on the first night, thousands on the second night. Some drunk. Some who never found their identities. Some who were beaten, others who got away without a scratch. Some who went on to organize, and then fight against other people in the community, or fought the rise of TERFs and SWERFs and the decaying homophiles. \n\nThat's what makes stonewall important.",

Both Johnson and Rivera self identified as gay men who were into drag, not as trans. \n\nFor better or worse the entire Stonewall narrative has been manipulated and changed to try to credit Pride to the efforts of black trans people and this simply isn\u2019t true at all.

I had a 2 year relationship with a man and 4 months later entered a 2 year relationship with a woman, and yet people STILL THOUGHT I was just choosing sides. Isn't the logical explanation that I like both genders and don't care about sides? It's confusing to me how that idea exists haha. And I've actually seen some bi people just go with it and say their label is changed to shut people up, but that sort of sets the whole thing back a little bit when they have to come out as bi again later to date someone else, and it furthers the crap stereotype that bisexuals \"choose\".\n\nMy ex bf though flipped out because he thought I left him for my \"change\" to being a lesbian, even though he knew I was bi the whole time we were together and he cheated on me right before we broke up... two and two together would mean I left you cause you cheated and fell in love with this girl because I'm bi. It's a logic fail but that definitely goes with your dashed hopes thing. I wish people would see it as part of being bi and not a \"change\".

Then there are people who do actually change their label (be it due to peer pressure or an internal change in sexual identity).

But to give it another shot - obviously people are going to absorb dumb things they see and if they see it too much, ignorantly take it as fact. Biphobia usually, according to biphobic people, is basically there because they see so many gay people use it as a stepping stone/people lie and claim they're bi for the purpose of attracting the opposite sex/etc. It appears like a phase then, even though in reality, those people just weren't bisexual.\n\nAs I said in my post, I know it's not being done on purpose, but I've yet to have one person who did use it as a stepping stone actually acknowledge that they understand the problem it creates and understand that it inadvertently causes biphobia (most of time anyway - some people are just really ignorant and phobic of anything outside of their \"normal\"). You said you didn't know it would cause problems, and I fully know you didn't. What bothers me is that a connection is often made that the stepping stone could cause problems, but not that it could cause biphobia, which doesn't add up to me.\n\nThere are totally other ways to come out than saying you're bi! I wish more gay people weren't scared to try them/had gay friends already to help out so they didn't feel like they had to stepping stone out. My best friend is gay and he seriously just told me \"You can't ever tell anyone since I know I never will, but I'm gay\". I gave him a huge hug and talked to him about how I came out and how I'm sure he would someday too, so he shouldn't say never. A month later he told some of our other friends, including his straight male friend he had a crush on. Then he told his older sister, then his parents. Of course some ignorance was faced, but he never once played the bisexual card - started right out with gay. :)\n\nI guess because I've seen (not just with his story) some of my gay friends come out right off as gay and then some say \"bisexual\" first to step out, and both always worked out the same in the end, I don't get why the stepping stone was needed. Again, no mean tone this whole time, just explanation. Wish there was a font for that haha.",

It's fantastic to hear that you're finding new info from posts on here. I am too, about gay issues I don't fully understand. It definitely goes more smoothly when people are rational and willing to hear both sides/open to learning new ideas. :)\n\nBut now to address the top portion. I totally get the idea that we can act straight, so it seems easier. Its just almost laughable how the other half of that where we still don't choose who we love gets forgotten. I'll be the first to admit my straight relationships were easier than my gay ones, but I actually get stupid comments during my straight ones too, like \"so you're not gay anymore?\". Or when I break up with a guy, I'm \"back to being a lesbian after having some real sex\". Seriously.. every single time. Then of course there's the obvious issues when I'm in a gay relationship.\n\nI'm sure jealousy plays a huge role! It's natural to worry, it's just strange to worry more that I'll leave for a man than for another woman - our relationship is our relationship, and if it ends, it's not because of my orientation. ",

When I asked how that made sense, she said I might just go for the easier route and date a guy, and that we have it easier. I was really confused. I don't think we have it *way* harder, but we definitely don't have it easier, that's for sure. There's special discrimination for us! haha. I just wish it was possible to get these sort of situations raised to attention without being attacked for it, as some posts are doing. \n\nI try to explain that we can't choose who we love - if I love a girl, I can't just choose to stop and immediately fall in love with a man for simplicity. I totally understand how gay people don't think of bisexuality though, and it IS hard to understand fully. A lot of people in general don't understand that the confusion goes both ways - I personally can't fathom just being gay or straight, and really just don't get how it happens sometimes. I accidentally came out at 12 because I was dumb and honestly grew up thinking that everyone was bi, they just wound up with a man or a woman (this is because I have a set of lesbian aunts and a set of gay uncles, but straight parents). Once I slipped and mentioned a girl crush I had.. out of the closet I was and into the ignorant bashing I went haha. But despite me understanding others' confusion, I still do find myself bothered when gay people won't have respectful conversations like this and *try* to understand at least. Like I said, you'd imagine there'd be more support from people that are going through very similar oppression and whatnot. I am getting insight from your posts though, so thank you by the way!",

Doesn't seem very kind to me, but sure, I'm sorry cause I know the internet makes it impossible to tell when people are being mean. But no, I am not just out to be a victim, so that was inaccurate. And you're literally the only person on this thread saying that, everyone else has given insight and listened to what I had to say.\n\nAnd I guess that makes sense, it's just so weird to me because I always thought bisexual would make it a little bit worse despite the false hope it gives families, simply because it's less heard of and therefore could be taken as \"weirder\". I've seen that taken both ways but from this thread I'm seeing it more as the \"there's hope they'll be straight\" side.\n\nAnd I already said I get that, but I also pointed out the vast number of people who come out as gay and it turns out the same. And as the other poster on this thread said, she just wound up having to come out all over again and coming out as bi was pointless. That's what I'm trying to point out - it causes biphobia for no real reason. I never ever ever said it was about me, so I really don't get that. I also never said gay people are the sole reason it exists. I was voicing a concern about bisexual people, and I don't see you addressing that. Yes I used my experiences, but it wasn't just about me, which should be obvious. I'm voicing a concern about lots of people, so I think your perspective could use adjusting too, not just mine. By the way, bisexual teens are scared to be rejected now too because of the stereotypes scared gay teens/skanky straight teens are aiding to perpetuate.. and therefore when you say \"not a single bisexual person would be hurt\", it's true they wouldn't be hurt by you right then and there, but you're definitely hurting them in the long run. See what I'm saying? It's a problem that's accidentally creating another problem.",

I'm saying there's more than enough people in each community who hate bisexuals that we feel unwelcomed in both communities. Look on r/bisexual - this isn't something I've made up.

        "body": "I was just saying to a friend earlier how amazing it was for me to discover the r/bisexual subreddit because I feel like I'm not welcome in the gay or straight communities. Why? Well, the obvious, ignorant views of many members of both communities - \"bisexual women are lying to attract men, bisexuals are actually gay and too scared to come out, bisexual is a phase, bisexuals aren't as oppressed as gays (which is ABSOLUTE crap), bisexuals are sluts/insatiable\" etc.\n\nThen I came to the LGBT subreddit and searched \"bisexual\" to see if it's been discussed here. What I found were lots of gay people, in the lgBt subreddit, acting like being intolerant of bisexuals is okay because SOME people have lied about it. I also found lots of gay people who think it's okay to lie and say they're bisexual as a \"transition\" to coming out of the closet entirely.\n\nI ask of you, LGBT folks - why is it okay for some of you to welcome gays, pansexuals, gender queers, transgenders, etc. with open arms, but not bisexuals? There is a B in LGBT you know. Also, what is the reasoning for why it's okay for gay people to use bisexual as a transition, when they know they're gay? Why not just say you're gay? Whether you mean to do it or not, lying causes problems for real bisexuals. Call me bitter, but this is the truth, and I want to hear valid reasoning for it so that maybe, I can attempt to understand the logic.\n\nEDIT: Before I'm attacked with mean comments about how I'm dissing the LGBT community as a whole, let me make it clear that I am not, nor am I even being bitchy or furious. I'm appreciative that this community exists for those who need it and can gain from it. I'm just questioning why MANY, not all, people of the LGBT community are so mean about my orientation and make me feel unwelcome in groups. I just want to hear the logic behind the mistrust.\n\nEDIT AGAIN: Notice I specified \"PEOPLE WHO *KNOW* THEY ARE GAY\" when I mentioned those who use it as a transition. OBVIOUSLY I didn't mean people who are actually unsure, cause I feel like pretty much everyone's been there at a point. Just to make that even more clear. Also, this was gathered on and off reddit, and IRL, so \"trolls\" isn't really a response (not to be mean - just to avoid more comments that misjudge what I said). Also, I'm now going to entirely reword that statement because even though I said all this, people are still taking it way out of context.",

It is only your perception that my small penis is still a clitoris, and just because \"most people's minds\" would agree with you doesn't make it true.\n\nWell, no, but it does have implications for what they mean when they say it.\n\n> And if my neo-phallus grows long enough to actually penetrate certain orifices, what is it then? Is it still just a clitoris to you then?\n\nDoes it matter?\n\n> I fail to see why the fact that my neo-phallus was once a clitoris means I should necessarily feel like I have anything I ought to make up for.\n\nLet's not kid ourselves. We all have good sides and bad sides, and when it comes to dating, we use our good sides to make up for the bad sides. In the gay community, a small penis is usually not a big advantage, but guys with small penises make up for it by being awesomely good at other things (like being really good looking, very sympathetic, being awesome bottoms, etc.). Similarly, some guys think they can be assholes because they have huge dicks\u2026\n\n> It seems unlikely that most guys could tell the difference between a so-called \"real penis\" and a realistic dildo when it's being shoved into certain orifices anyway. \n\nThat's not the point. Being turned on by a penis is different from being penetrated by one.\n\n> In fact, there are types of sex guys can have with me that they can't with other cis men.\n\nSure, and that's great. I'm sure there are lots of guys out there who would enjoy that. They're not necessarily the same guys who are attracted to penises.\n\n> Oh, and btw, I didn't downvote you.\n\nI didn't downvote you either, just for the record. I'm perfectly aware that not everyone in here is as willing as you are to have a civil debate. ;)",

It seems unlikely that most guys could tell the difference between a so-called \"real penis\" and a realistic dildo when it's being shoved into certain orifices anyway. In fact, there are types of sex guys can have with me that they can't with other cis men. Maybe it's they who ought to feel they have something to make up for. (I don't actually intend to claim that I'm in any way better than other cis men, I'm just trying to point out how absurd I think your implication of needing to \"make up for it\" sounds.)\n\nEdit: Oh, and btw, I didn't downvote you. I find debates quite illuminating. :) I just don't want my masculinity to be dismissed on the sole basis that my small penis was once a clitoris. I think you'd be really surprised what surgeons can do for guys who can afford bottom surgery these days, though. If it wasn't so expensive and risky, I might actually consider a partial metoidioplasty.",

I am aware that you (and just about every other trans man out there) disagree, but I'll share my opinion: When people talk about sex and gender, they really *are* talking about the bits. For the most part. You can claim that physical configuration has nothing to do with *actual* gender, and that's an interesting hypothesis, but it doesn't change what people *mean* when they *say* it. There's a strong implication, that when someone says \"I like boys\", then it means that they appreciate dicks.\n\nA majority (speculative claim, feel free to contest it if you can make a plausible argument) of gay men are in fact very much attracted to penises, and couldn't care fuck all about notions of \"gender identity\" or some obscure (and might I add half-sexist) idea of an \"essential\" gender.\n\nThis is not to delegitimize gender dysphoria or transgenderism. It is to state the simple reality that life for trans people, especially trans men, *sucks*, because it's currently not possible for them to achieve (by surgery or otherwise) what *most people* would call a \"real penis\".\n\nWe cannot change our sexual attractions (at least I don't know how), and in most people's minds, your \"small penis\" is still a clitoris. I would personally have great trouble escaping from that reality, and so would most other people. The good news, of course, is that you may posses many other great attributes, that effectively make up for your perceived lack of penis. :) I mean, nobody's perfect anyway.",

My father didn't have much of either, so I can't really get my hopes up too high. I would be disappointed of course, but I wouldn't feel offended by a guy who politely explained to me that he only likes to date guys with big dicks. In a similar way, I'm not sure I could feel right dating a guy who only bottoms because I enjoy bottoming quite a bit myself. Those are preferences, which everyone has. I would however be offended by someone who dismisses me just after telling him that I'm trans only because it somehow instantly made me unworthy and/or less of a man to him. No, nobody here has actually said it, but it'd be really nice if people didn't disrespect others by feeling entitled to claim that only people who fit their standards are \"real\" boys, and that goes for all guys, cis and trans alike.

I don't mean to insinuate that you're ignorant, or hateful or anything stupid like that, but the truth of the matter is, all those things that lead you to being classed as a 'mans man', are qualities set by a society that needs to reinforce the gender hierarchy of man over woman and macho over effete.\n\nIn your desire to express how little of the gay stereotype you bear resemblance to, you admit how much of another, equally enforced, stereotype that you are a willing participant of. I feel like it's not healthy, the need to express how much of a 'normal' man you are, being gay and going through life experiencing all these interconnecting relationships between gender expression and sexual desire, I feel like we should be the best equipped to acknowledge them for the tropes they are and move past it.

I am pissed, ruffled, miffed, vexed, downright irritated by people who love to build category-cartons of people based on stereotypical sexuality. Alright then, it is best I start at the beginning. I remember something about God uttering the words **fiat lux**... No? Am I then to presume that I am dealing with a crowd of tolerably intelligent human beings who suffer no more the tripe of dated and hackneyed ancient morality which served no purpose but to code customs unique to hairy sun-burnt tribes wandering the Levantine deserts? Good. This establishes a presumption of some satisfactory understanding of the mechanisms of Evolution. But, dear friends, one must remember that while evolution is described as speciation and pretty clades, there is a much neglected branch that deals in the evolution of the human brain. Yes, that massively powerful unit capable of storing petabytes of information while processing them parallely at terahertz levels also undergoes this process, and it is responsible almost completely for the nature of our physical desires. Sexuality, as it were, is centred in the Interstitial Nucleus in the anterior hypothalamus, and varies structurally with variations in sexual predisposition, all of which can be looked up on-line, and bear only the standing of concept introduction here.  We cannot hope to understand sexuality without a comprehensive study of this machine, and while stellar work has been published on the subject, we are no nearer to understanding these tendencies than we are to observing the Higgs Boson. Suffice it to say, even scientific evidence provides minimal demarcation between gay and straight men, and almost nothing about their respective behaviours.\n \nLet me take you to my chief bone-of-contention: Gay men are not masculine, or as is counter-implicitly: Stereotypical notions of manhood clash with stereotypical notions of homosexuality. I say this: Fuck you. We are all not those alleged pansies that are the butt of jock-jokes, fluttering from cock to cock like some polychromatic feather boa-ed eye-shadowed high-pitched-and-heeled cat-fighting limp-wristed Glee-loving butterfly who would prefer to paint their nails and prance around twinkle-toed to *It\u2019s Raining Men* with all their BFF gal pals than work on their automobiles while headbanging to some *Judas Priest* and watch cricket matches with their straight buddies. Let me reiterate: Fuck you. The florid stereotype, ironically as *gay* as the description of it, does bear kernels of truth: There are such gay men, and while they are not to be maligned for their choice of expression, are not to be mistaken for the whole. There are entire subsets that are completely ignored because they so inconspicuously blend into heteronormativity. It is a sad state of affairs that men who are typically masculine as well as gay are more afraid of coming out for fear of change in their social system than those who are open and overly expressive of it. Call them MSMs, as they are widely classified.\n \nThere is, however, a very small subset of these MSMs, who  are manly and gay and proud of being both. We call ourselves BLBs (Boys-who-like-boys), for the lack of a better term. We are men first, and gay second. Call us *straight-acting* with all the intent of a striking cobra: It means naught for we are men and deafeningly proud of it. We work with our hands; we engage in outdoor activities; we laugh from the belly up; we live in filth and are acceptably embarrassed by our inability to not smell like musk-deer carcasses; we burp, sneeze, yawn, fart, piss in public with not the slightest shame; we afford ourselves all the comforts of the typical male, with the following addendum: Only if our life depended on it would we be forced to see, touch, smell, taste (and that order we will take with increasing torture) the female genitalia. We even refrain from mentioning the gory and terrifyingly-descriptive names our straight counterparts have suggested for the aforementioned organs. Boobs are fine. Or not, depending on personal choice or context. I speak for myself. \n \nBut we want boys. We like people with boy bits and body hair and muscular chests and strong jaws. If that makes us pussy-boys, then we challenge you sexually-unconfident straight men to a contest on your own terms. Let\u2019s see how you fat hideous balding pigs, who sit at home all day jerking off to lesbians doing each other in case, god forbid, you glimpse a penis in your masturbatory marathons and lose your mood because, let\u2019s come out and say it, that\u2019s really what makes a man, handle us in a physical confrontation. Losers are downgraded to nothing but vagina for the rest of their lives.\n \n*initiate sequence of chest-thumping*\n\n**EDIT:** I honestly did not mean to portray anyone or anything other than stereotypes in a bad light. I just like being what I am; I did not mean to suggest that everyone who isn't what I am are in the wrong. I understand that it is all about stereotypes at the end of the day, and I would rather fit into stereotypes that *actually* match my behaviour and qualities than ones that don't.",

It exists as an event to encourage openness and freedom, have a celebratory atmosphere, boost self-esteem for those involved, and also campaign for [increased or sustained] civil rights.\n\nThat aspect of pride isn't inherently gay. It is inherently about having been marginalized and afraid, and about [committing to] being more open, more connected, and less afraid.\n\nSo, back to wearing less clothing:\n\nIt isn't always sexual.

It symbolically can represent not having to hide, being visible on purpose as a participant of pride.\n\nWhen it is about being sexy, I honestly think being unafraid of having a sexuality, [despite not being straight, and therefore not conforming to some of society's expectations,] is again still in the spirit of the event. Within reason, being sexual demonstrates that we have that right. Sexuality is kind of part of being a person, if you are not asexual. Many LGBT folks have trouble finding acceptance to be as openly sexual as straight is people can be in public, and pride is a place to counterbalance society at large's expectations.\n\nLastly, some people just like to be sexy in public, regardless of the context, and having permission to do that makes it a more enjoyable event for those people. Don't know how I feel about that, but sometimes you can't tell which is which. It's okay to want to celebrate sexuality in-and-of itself, right? That is honestly the more controversial part of nearly-naked people at Pride as far as I can tell. Kinda similar: Public nudity is \"radical,\" too, not just in an explicitly LGBT-related way. \n\nEDIT: I'm hoping I don't try too hard to explain things. I just wanted to point out why we have pride the way we do, how we got here. Nakedness is indeed a fairly common thing at parades, so take my post with that in mind. It is definitely not just a gay thing, not just an LGBT thing.",

I mean come on, who wants to live with no changes, what kinda life is that. What basis would there be for innovation. Now, if they were libertarians they would feel government should have no say *what-so-ever* for hetero or homo marriages. Or for a lot of things the government has control/say over.\n\nIt's sad that people feel the need to choose a party. Especially, one that takes away are civil liberties or doesn't recognize them in the first place. Isn't it our duty to have a party that represents the people furthermore the person? In this case (your life) the person is a gay man. Agreed that's not the center of your life, which is ok, for most I would say it isn't. But the problem is, if Republicans did have their way; you wouldn't be able to have the same rights every hetero does. You believe in a strong military, but one you couldn't serve in. A foreign policy that enacts their same views on other *independant* countries. Laws would be established  on the views of the religion that manipulates the moral view of the individual. \n\nSo It's ok to be Republican, If that's how you feel. If that best fits you then go for it. Just think what you're giving up by doing so though. I'm not saying the Dems are better, they aren't by much.

I mean the GOP praises itself on it's economic decisions yet is relentlessness when it comes to starting a war.",

There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding here, which is that masculine gay guys act that way because they're deliberately trying to repress their sexuality, or something similarly idiotic. The whole point of that guy's comment, short of the moronic Fred Phelps jab, is that you should do things because you enjoy them. Guess what? Maybe, just *maybe*, some masculine gay guys act masculine because they enjoy doing masculine things - not because they're \"manly\" activities but because *they enjoy doing those things*.\n\nI consider myself to be masculine because the activities I enjoy are masculine - **not** the other way around. Consequently, I want to be able to have relationships with men who behave similarly, because I have more in common with a guy who likes sports and plays video games than a party queen who loves musicals and wants to be a fashion designer. The source of my greatest anxiety about my sexuality is the simple fact that I feel mostly alone in my identity. The gay guys I know are practically all stereotypically gay, and - as a high school student who really hasn't had contact with a very diverse gay population - I experience a variety of intermittent anxiety and, perhaps, depression because it feels like I'm going to grow old and never meet another guy who doesn't bother to express his sexuality in ways unrelated to sex. Obviously that's not true, but it's incredibly discouraging to have to go through life being the invisible queer who constantly has to explain that, yes, I am gay and no, I don't want to go shopping or clubbing with you and, no, I'm not interested in the \"hot boy candy\" you can hook me up with and can you please stop treating me like I'm gay and nothing else, because guess what, the moment you condense the entirety of my being to \"gay\" is the moment you figure out why mass murder and genocide are so *fucking* easy.\n\nThe whole \"logic\" of that type of person that you quoted is exactly the reason I struggled with my sexuality for such a long time. There's this huge myth that you can't simultaneously be gay and just a \"normal guy.\" It's like to be gay you have to love musicals and be flamboyant and want to be a fashion designer and party hard or whatever other stereotypical bullshit there is and you don't have a choice, because doing anything else makes you a stereotypical male and god forbid you act like a \"regular dude\" and also enjoy sucking dick. I know that's not exactly what the person you quoted is saying, but it expresses that same infuriating sentiment and I *hate it*. I just want to be a guy, that's it. I don't give a fuck about gender roles or being a manly man or whatever. I want to be able to do whatever the hell I want and not have people give a shit if I go from listening to gangsta rap to watching Eddie Izzard to playing *Grand Theft Auto* to making out with another dude, but it's people like the guy you quoted who assert that, unless I explicitly say I'm listening to gangsta rap and playing *Grand Theft Auto* because I enjoy it and not because it's \"manly\" or whatever, then clearly I'm just doing it to try and reinforce whatever little heteronormalcy I have left and am a bigoted self-hating faggot who wishes he were straight.\n\nAnd don't tell me this is over my head, because I used to be a major heteronormativity hack and, to be honest, I still think heteronormativity is some bullshit, but there's a difference between being deliberately heteronormative in an effort to avoid \"seeming gay\" or dumb shit like that and behaving in a seemingly heteronormative way because *that's how you act*.

I'm very similar to snyper7 in that I don't like being called \"babe\" or \"honey\" or similar names, but specifically I feel that way because I think \"babe\" and \"honey\" are diminutive and infantilizing. Since snyper7 hasn't responded, I can't say why he feels the way he feels about those terms, but I dislike them because I feel that they're disempowering. \"Bro\" or \"dude\" or whatever else isn't disempowering because it's an equalizer. Calling someone \"bro\" doesn't disempower them. In fact, if the person being spoken to feels disempowered, being called \"bro\" is more likely to make them feel more empowered because they're being acknowledge as an equal. On the other hand, if someone already feels disempowered (or insecure) and then is called \"baby\" or \"honey,\" that's likely to make them feel even more disempowered because it reestablishes their low status.",

I'll do my best to break it down for you. \n\nSexual orientation (being gay, straight, bisexual, etc.) is all about who you want to date/snuggle/bang. In this context, it's easier to look at it as being attracted to men, women, or both (this ignores some complex gender identity stuff, but don't worry about that right now). The terms we use compare who we are attracted to with the gender with which we identity, but that doesn't really have anything to do with it. Let's assume you are a man who is interested in women. If you woke up tomorrow somehow magically in a woman's body, you would still be attracted to women, because that's what gets you going. Knowing what sort of gender you're attracted to is usually pretty simple. \n\nGender identity is more complicated. Let's go back to you waking up one day as a woman (or as a man if you are a woman). You would still be you, but your body would just be...wrong. Like wearing shoes that don't fit. You just know that this body isn't your body and it isn't right. Being trans is kind of like that, except you've always had the wrong body. If you had never worn shoes, but I have you a pair that was way too small, you would know that something wasn't right. Similarly, trans people always feel uncomfortable in their own skin. It's not always as simple as going from boy to girl or girl to boy and it can be really difficult to figure out what the problem is, exactly, but the feeling of wrongness is always there. This is called body dysmorphia, by the way. \n\nYou can actually be a trans lady (that's a person who was assigned the identity of male at birth, but self-identifies as a woman. Always refer to an out trans person as their preferred gender. You did a great job with pronouns above!) Who is attracted to ladies. So, that person seemed like a straight man, but is actually a lesbian woman. Her gender transitioned, but her attraction stayed the same, so it was never in question. \n\nAs a disclaimer, this is waaaay simplified, everyone's experience is different, and I don't speak for the LGBT community as a whole. But I hope this helps! ",

I would hazard a guess that many bi people push back on anti-choice rhetoric precisely because it denies their experiences. \n\nOf course, this isn't to say that the correct answer is to go to the opposite extreme, but it might help to explain where your friend is coming from.\n\n>If that was true... it would actually make all lgbt+ a mental disorder. \n\nThat does not follow. *X* being a choice does not imply that choosing *X* is a mental disorder. If I choose to, say, meditate in the morning that doesn't make meditation a mental disorder.\n\nAnyway, the real point is that even if sexuality is a choice, it's a valid choice to make. Nothing about the morality of bisexuality/homosexuality/etc. is contingent upon it being 'natural' or not a choice. Society shouldn't punish someone for making the 'wrong' choice by denying them equal rights and protection.

At least that's what I've been told. Point being that a developing brain and a developed brain aren't the same. It could be that environmental factors influence the growing brain in a number of irreversible ways.

However, I think it fucks with bisexual minds a bit differently because our experience so often is a constant ebb and flow between same sex and opposite sex attractions.  When some religious conservative spouts off that even if we can't control our attractions we can nevertheless control our decision to act on those attractions, it can be really hard as a bisexual to reject that premise outright because we, in theory at least, can choose not to act on our same sex attractions and still have meaningful sexual relationships.  \n\nOur passing privilege, then, becomes fertile breeding ground for internalized homophobia.  In trying to make sense of that, it's not uncommon, I think, for bisexuals to come to believe that being bi or asexual is the human default.  ",

This is all what I am thinking right now, I don't know though.\n",

The company owns and runs a church as well, though nothing like Westboro, still very much far right.  So, they are far right and probably suspected me a little bit before and maybe this friend request is them, because they just got my email recently as I've been talking with them about starting work again and never did make my friends list private.  So if they did decide to have a look at my Facebook, they would have seen my friends, many of which are obviously gay.\n\nI don't know this is happening at the moment, but I need this job so bad and I can just see this being them spying on me and then not hire me.

The job was easy and I made really great money.  The environment was so conservative that if they knew that I was gay they'd find a way to fire me.  I'm straight acting so I think they never suspected.  Then the recession came along and I lost that job just due to layoffs.\n\nNow, about two years later, broke and hard up for work, suddenly the job is happening again and I'm going to go out there to work.  But then I get this Facebook request from someone with no friends and no info and just an smooth ab profile picture, like really gay looking, cliche gay photo.  Well, I just after two years started talking by email with my old, conservative employer so they have my email and then I get this Facebook request and something tells me it's them.\n\nThey are really conservative, and I just noticed that I never hid my Facebook friends, many of which are obviously gay.  So, I get this friend request out of the blue after just talking with my employer and for some reason I just know it's my old boss.  After we started talking about work again he must have plugged my email into Facebook and got my profile and looked and my friends and decided to make a fake gay looking profile and do a friend request to see if I'd accept it to confirm I'm gay so to not let me back to work.\n\nI am not for being in the closest at all, but I need this job, bad.  I guess I'll just go about it like nothing happened and see if they end up giving me my old job back or not.  Of course it might not be them; anyone know how to figure out like where a Facebook profile is from at least or anything?",

I'm a trans woman. Last year I was at a show dancing with a dude who obviously read me as a woman, and things seemed great, until someone I know came up and drunkenly outed me. The dude who'd been dancing with me stopped abruptly, gave me a look of surprise and disgust, and just walked away. Felt like shit, but the point is, I went from attractive enough to dance with to unattractive and even disgusting, all because he found out I was trans (plus his prejudices mixed with what must've been a whole slew of assumptions about what that meant). He literally saw me differently based on new information about me.\n\nTake that scenario and replace \"trans\" with \"jew\" or \"hispanic\" or whatever, and it should be easy to understand that that's racist. That's finding out after the fact, but our unconscious (or conscious) prejudices can *also* alter who we're attracted to before ever meeting someone.\n\nFortunately, we are not helpless to our own prejudices, because we can alter our brains through learning and change our perceptions of people.",

I'd recommend reading up on this very interesting subject a little more, so as to more effectively use these kinds of arguments. My last sentence was just my effort to put in my 2\u00a2 worth on the original post.\n\nPaul is credited with writing some of the non-Gospel parts of the New Testament. Some of these are almost certainly not authored by Paul. Nonetheless, much of what we think about as fundamental to Christianity is rooted in these writings and not in the words attributed to Jesus.\n\nYou're right that the Torah, the \"Five Books of Moses\", of which Leviticus is one, are traditionally attributed to Moses, but this is clearly not the case, as the death of Moses and subsequent \"history\" are recounted here. Besides which, modern archeology finds no evidence of the Biblical Exodus, and Moses, bearing all the hallmarks of a mythic culture hero, probably never existed. \n\nWhat we know of as the Torah was probably cobbled together from older written and oral sources by Jewish elites either during the Babylonian exile, or upon their return to Judea after the Persian triumph over the Babylonians. The Prophet Ezra, who \"found\" the \"Book of the Law\" in the reconsecrated Temple is a likely suspect for authorship (or more likely, a committee led by Ezra.) \n\nChristians tend to interpret the Old Testament as a prelude and introduction to the advent of Jesus Christ, the messiah. This is of course not the intent of the authors and editors of the older work. Ezra was more concerned about firmly (re-?)establishing the cult of JHVH with it's priestly center in Jerusalem, and suppressing the native polytheism that continued to flourish among the common folk, as can be seen from the polemic against these practices in the Old Testament, and modern archeological investigations.",

Evidence seems to show that it was only Paul who was outspoken about the acceptance of slavery and homosexuality being a sin. Since Jesus himself never said that homosexuality was wrong, is it not therefore reasonable to assume that the part about homosexuality being a sin is probably from Paul's letters?\n\nMy point is, there are plenty of reasons why we shouldn't necessarily (and in reality we already don't) take the bible explicitly as a final word on how to define what is moral and good and what is immoral and bad. It's the ultimate act of hypocrisy to make specific behaviors and acts illegal, or excuse intolerance of certain behaviors and acts, by citing the bible only when it suits your purposes as the majority. We don't hear any of them calling for a ban against divorce or shellfish or women's rights, which is also in the bible. And do you know why? Simply because these are things the majority of people don't feel they should be denied. People will stop going to their churches if they insisted on punishing and alienating people for defying everything in the bible, so they don't even bother. That's why the clergy are so worried about being persecuted; the more people they allow to sympathize with homosexuals and start demanding equal rights, the more their homophobia drives away parishioners, thus continuing to reduce their ability to exert their influence and power over the people. And that's why in another generation or so, I'm confident that homophobia will be all but gone, and hopefully transphobia with it.",

This is just what I've learned recently and is the theological interpretation of one of my professors.\n\nThe passages in Leviticus that you refer to are also pretty shaky because of the translation of the word \"abomination.\" The word abomination, in the context of the Old Testament, means something more along the lines of \"against tradition\" or \"not commonly practiced.\" When translated from Hebrew, this phrase/word may have been misconstrued. Many of the Leviticus verses are sort of recommendations on how to live or rules to follow. At the time, it was \"not customary\" for Hebrews to engage in same-sex relations, that's all. It may have been suggested to avoid homosexual relationships because at the time, the Hebrew nation (or however you'd like to refer to that group of people) was very small and marginalized. It has been speculated that the book of Leviticus was giving guidelines on how to live properly, safely, and reproduce, because their numbers were small. Basically, (as we all know) homosex=no babies, so that practice would have been discouraged. Same thing with eating shellfish and pork-- they discouraged those practices because no one at that time knew how to clean shellfish or prepare pork (it was an \"unclean\" animal) and so eating them could make you ill.\n\nCrazy how one little word, translated in a certain way, hinges on our modern society's beliefs and politics. \n\nAgain, my prof said that many biblical scholars hold this interpretation to be pretty misleading. Translations can be all over the place, because Hebrew and Greek are tricky. \n\n/college student scripture lesson",

Likewise, I don't persecute people simply for believing in God. I condemn those that hate us because they think it's okay to do so \"because God said so\". Their hate and ignorance is validated with the thinking that, because specific verses in the bible said it was a sin, it is their right to be hateful people and discriminate against gay and trans folks.\n\nActually, it was only Paul, the favorite apostle, not God or Jesus, who wrote in Leviticus that a man lying with a man as with a woman is a sin. He also wrote that slaves and women should obey their masters and husbands. Does that make it right to be racist or sexist? Hell no. Did these same religious people who hate and discriminate against non-white people excuse their racism by citing this passage in the bible, and then also use it to justify male privilege in our society as well? Of course they did, but religious people don't claim that any more. Why? Because racism is *wrong* and sexism is *wrong*, just like discrimination against homosexuals is *wrong*, and Christianity as a religion stopped promoting racism and sexism when the clergy decided it was better to have have all those non-white or female people in their churches worshiping their God beside them than it was to continue alienating them as rebellious slaves who refused to accept their rightful place as second-class citizens in our society. The way the clergy are treating homosexuals and the transgendered right now is no different at all, and it's wrong to make us into second-class citizens simply because you think your religion makes you entitled to privilege over us.\n\nAccept it: no one is forcing you to choose between your religion and universal freedom and liberty except the clergy who are propagating hate as part of their religion. If you want religion without all the hate, join a different church that preaches tolerance and forgiveness instead of hate, and I would happily show you all the respect you deserve.",

Personally I wouldnt bother with highschool friends trying to understand sexuality, just wait until college. (You also have to remember, that people in highschool arent exactly 'learned' of the world, and are essentially--for the most part--amalgamations of whatever their parents bigotries are. Most wont start questioning 'their beliefs' for a little while longer, which means coming out later to them generally heightens the chances of accepting you.)\n\nBuuuut, thats just what I **would** have told myself, had I been able to go back in time.",

I'm partially closeted 20 year-old man and very much bisexual.\n\nAs far as coming out, I really like the the guy on youtube with the user name \"AreYouSurprised.\" He says coming out is a lot like throwing up. You'll know when its time, Its vastly uncomfortable doing it, and after you're done you feel a lot better regardless of how it turns out. You don't have to come out unless you're ready, and if you don't want people to know, you can hide it as long as you want.\n\nI'm a little bit hurt right now too. A guy, that I'm good friends with and was getting reading to vomit up my dark secret to, turned out to be really homophobic. He's a good friend, and now I know I'll never be able to tell him, because he'd never look at me or interact with me one-on-one again if he knew. I didn't know quite how to react at the time, but I think now i'm just going to be stalled in the road.\n\nComing out to my mom has been the hardest so far. She knew something was wrong with me, so I tried pretending to be asexual. Didn't work out so well... I eventually had to tell her I was interested in both. She told me I wasn't really attracted to guys. It was just me noticing good looks. Then three months later we had the vomit moment. I came home, I was talking about coming out to dad. She then asks me how I know I'm bisexual. I say \"same way you know you're strait.\" then she asks if I've ever had an encounter with another man. I'm frustrated because she doesn't understand and I lose my cool and blurt out that I've made out with another man. I shock her. We have a great three-day conversation. She sort of accepts it now, but she loves me the same. My dad still doesn't know. A few of my good friends know.\n\nI guess, in summary, it sucks being closeted sometimes. It sucks when you have to come out sometimes. The good new is though, that people like us have all the time in the world (as long as we're not dragged out of the closet.) So don't tell them if you're not ready. Nobody should ever rush you. Don't tell them if you don't want to, or you're scared of them rejecting you. I go on reddit all the time to talk about this and read about this, because this is the only place I'm completely public and accepted for being bisexual right now.",

I am also a closeted bisexual, except for to like 3 people who are close to me. Tonight I was hanging out with a bunch of other close friends at a friendly's house, and we were doing typical teenager stuff. Spin the bottle. Truth or dare. Ya know...\n\nAnyways, it was a guys turn and it the bottle landed on another guy. There was a good laugh had, and this brought up the topic of gay people, or just guys liking guys. One of my good friends made a comment on how she was afraid uncomfortable around gay people and many friends chimed in, agreeing. You have to understand that it's only been this past year, 2011, that I've come to accept and embrace who I am, personally. So it kinda stung. But I dealt. \n\nLater on we just got into discussing our deepest darkest secrets. One of my friends saw a relative die. Another admitted that she was constantly depressed for the last year. My deepest secret ( I dont know wether to be happy that this is the deepest it gets for me, or sad) is my bisexuality. But based on what had happened when the bottle was spun, I realized I couldn't tell them. I mean I could, but it would just make them uncomfortable around me. It also made me realize that I can't tell so many people who are close to me for the same reason. My mom. My dad. My family. All of them wouldn't understand. \n\nI feel like my only two choices are telling them and assuredly made out to be \"wrong\" or \"he's just confused\" or something, or not telling anyone and remaining in this funk for a long time. And I cannot come out. Not in the near future at least. So please don't try to convince me of that. And please don't say \"They're not your true friends if they cant accept you.\" Many of them are indeed people who I have the honor to call best friends. So just moving on is not an option. This while thing, it sucks, and I'm just so damned depressed about it. It really hurts. \n",

Today in America, nearly 65 percent of LGBT individuals report experiencing discrimination in their daily lives. LGBT youth are nearly twice as likely as their peers to be physically assaulted at school, and 74 percent of LGBT students say they\u2019ve been verbally harassed for their sexual orientation. And a recent study found that nearly 50 percent of of LGBT elders experienced discrimination when applying for senior housing. Despite this discrimination, 31 states do not have fully inclusive LGBT non-discrimination laws. Hillary will work with Congress to pass the Equality Act, continue President Obama\u2019s LGBT equality executive actions, and support efforts to clarify that sex discrimination includes discrimination on the basis of \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201csexual orientation.\u201d\n\n>Support LGBT youth, parents, and elders. Hillary will end LGBT conversion therapy for minors; combat youth homelessness by ensuring adequate funding, and safe and welcoming shelter, for youth; protect LGBT elders against discrimination; improve school climate by working to pass the Safe Schools Improvement Act and the Student Non-Discrimination Act; and collect national data that will help us better serve LGBT individuals and families.\n\n>Honor the military service of LGBT people. Every day, LGBT service members valiantly fight for our country around the world. Hillary believes we should honor their service and ensure they receive the benefits they have earned. As commander in chief, Hillary will upgrade service records of LGBT veterans dismissed due to their sexual orientation and support efforts to allow transgender personnel to serve openly.\n\n>Secure affordable treatment for people living with HIV and AIDS. While the United States has made great progress in the treatment and prevention of HIV and AIDS, our job is not done. As secretary of state, Hillary began an ambitious campaign to usher in an AIDS-free generation. As president, she will continue to drive towards that goal by calling on all Republican governors to extend Medicaid coverage to provide life-saving health care to people living with HIV, capping out-of pocket expenses for people with HIV/AIDS, and expanding the utilization of HIV prevention medications, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).\n\n>Protect transgender rights. We must do more to end discrimination against the transgender community. Hillary believes no one should be held back from fully participating in our society because of their gender identity. As secretary of state, Hillary made it possible for transgender Americans to have their true identity reflected on their passports. As president, she will work to protect transgender individuals from violence by directing the government to collect better data regarding crime victims and seeking to improve reporting of hate crimes; streamline identity documents to remove barriers to transgender Americans changing their gender marker on identification documents; and invest in law enforcement training focused on fair and impartial policing, including in interactions with LGBT individuals. Hillary will invest in law enforcement training that focuses on issues such as implicit bias, use of force, and de-escalation, as well as fair and impartial policing including in their interactions with the LGBT community, in particular transgender individuals. It will also focus on educating police officers on correctly identifying bias-motivated crimes.\n\n>Promote human rights of LGBT people around the world. As secretary of state, Hillary stood before the United Nations Human Rights Council and and told the world's leaders, \"Gay rights are human rights.\" Hillary will continue to promote LGBT human rights and ensure America\u2019s foreign policy is inclusive of LGBT people around the world, including increasing our investment in the Global Equality Fund to advance the human rights of LGBT people around the world.",

You have to take into account that DADT banned active investigations into a person's sexuality, actually allowed LGBT soldiers to enlist, and prohibited discrimination on the grounds of sexuality. Sanders voted against this.\n\n>In 1996, Sanders argued against DOMA, which is great, but not because of LGBT rights but because of state rights.\n\n>In 2006, he was against gay marriage in Vermont, favoring civil unions because he was more \"comfortable\" with the latter.\n\n>Sanders hasn't explicitly had a position on gay marriage till 2009.

        "body": "I'm sort of getting frustrated with the level of dismissiveness with Hillary Clinton when it comes to LGBT issues, I don't think she gets the credit or justice she deserves for her work on these issues. Often when citing her achievements and efforts in advancing the LGBT cause, people provide the link of the video of her saying \"marriage is between one man and one woman.\" Let's start by establishing that her opposition to same-sex marriage over a decade ago does not nullify the progress she has made on these issues. Let's also establish that **gay rights aren't limited to marriage, there is more to the cause of LGBT rights than just marriage.**\n\nLet's start by getting this out of the way: [*Yes Hillary Clinton did oppose marriage equality, as most people in her age group did at that time, and also evolved on the issue*](http://www.vox.com/2015/4/12/8384397/hillary-clinton-lgbt-issues).\n\nPresident Obama and other politicians have evolved on same-sex marriage, and Obama has been hailed as a hero for the advancement of LGBT rights, and rightfully so. Why is this double standard applied only to Hillary Clinton? Other people evolved because of the people that they love came out, because their close friends, their family, their sons and daughters, they all took a stand. This made people change their minds, it made people evolve on this issue, as did the blood, sweat, and tears of LGBT activists. \n\nSomehow the evolution of any regular person or politician Clinton's age is absolutely normal and fine - we should welcome it! But if Hillary Clinton jumps on board, she's just calculating and manipulative. She is greedy and only cares about herself - screw LGBT people! \n\n[It should also be noted that Hillary tried to help the marriage equality effort in Maryland in 2012 as Secretary of State behind the scenes.](http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/12/31/email-reveals-clinton-sought-to-help-with-md-marriage-effort/) For all we know she supported marriage equality a lot sooner than 2013, but she couldn't weigh in on domestic policy because she was Secretary of State, and doing so would undermine the administration she was serving in.\n\nYou can see how this view is harmful to the community and counter to the idea of making progress by shaming politicians who have evolved. We should encourage it. \n\nNow that is out of the way let me outline some of the things she has done for the LGBT community going as far back as First Lady. \n\n* As First Lady, her staff [actively tried to torpedo anti-gay legislation as seen in recently released emails.](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/clinton-white-house-gay-rights-hillary-clinton-staff-116859)\n\n* She was the first First Lady to march in a gay pride parade.\n\nAs a Senator:\n\n* She voted for LGBT anti-hate crime bills\n\n* She voted for the right of gay couples to be able to adopt.\n\n* She also **opposed** the amendment proposed by the Bush administration which would have constitutionally banned same-sex marriage.\n\nAs Secretary of State:\n\n* She put LGBT issues at the forefront of American foreign policy for the first time.\n\n* She made it easier for Transgender people to change their passports.\n\n* She made sure gay State Department employees received the same benefits as their straight counterparts.\n\n* She **LED THE FIRST EVER RESOLUTION IN THE UNITED NATIONS** declaring that *gay rights are human rights and human rights are gay rights.* [(NOTE: She said this \"in front of an audience filled with representatives from Arab and African countries, from places where homosexuality is a crime, even one punishable by death, and declared that gay rights and human rights \"are one and the same.\" Gay people, she explained, deserve equality simply because everyone does.\")](http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/30/opinion/ghitis-hillary-clinton-lgbt-rights/)\n\nThis article right before she left office as Secretary of State sums up her legacy on LGBT rights: [*\"As Hillary Clinton makes a whirlwind round of appearances in her last days as secretary of state, one groundbreaking aspect of her work deserves a moment in the spotlight: In a bold departure with tradition, Clinton made the promotion of equality for gay people a core value of U.S. foreign policy.\"*](http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/30/opinion/ghitis-hillary-clinton-lgbt-rights/)\n\n[*\"Clinton moved the issue of equality for members of the LGBT community to the front of America's diplomatic agenda; in the process, she gave a boost to human rights for all and a considerable nudge to the inexorable progress of freedom. Let's hope her successor doesn't let up.\"*](http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/30/opinion/ghitis-hillary-clinton-lgbt-rights/)\n\nLet's give Clinton credit where credit is due. She has reached out to LGBT voters in the past, and has laid out a bold and comprehensive plan for addressing LGBT rights as President, some of which consist of completely new ideas such as:\n\n* Cutting federal funding for adoption agencies who discriminate against gay couples.\n\n* Collect national data about LGBT in US Census reports and data to find out important information about LGBT people such as poverty rates and so on.\n\n* Upgrade the records of military people who were kicked out for being gay.\n\nAnd some ideas other candidates don't have in their platforms but aren't relatively new:\n\n* Addressing the crisis of LGBT youth homelessness.\n\n* Banning conversion therapy for LGBT youth.\n\nHillary has also been vocal, more than anyone else, when it comes to Transgender people on the campaign trail stating: \"We've got to address the crisis of transphobic violence,\u201d she said. \u201c2015 has seen the murder of at least 19 transgender women, primarily women of color. And nobody knows how much violence goes unreported or ignored. And we need to say, with one voice, that transgender people are valued, they are loved, they are us, they desire to be treated fairly and equally.\"\n\nSo in short, she deserves a lot more credit than she's getting for LGBT rights, especially on this sub. LGBT people don't only care about LGBT causes, that's true, but we need to stop the ignorant denial in the face of the facts of everything that she has done for LGBT people. She has done a lot. Especially in terms of global LGBT rights. She also went beyond domestic agenda and focused American foreign policy on the advancement of LGBT rights. LGBT rights also  matter outside of just the United States.\n\nI hope I could enlighten some of you when it comes to her record on LGBT rights, and [her current proposals go much further than any other candidate on LGBT rights in history, and they are very detailed and comprehensive.](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/12/17/fighting-for-full-equality/) She deserves credit where it's due. I'm not campaigning, but it does disservice to all of us to be ignorant about her record and what she has done for the community, especially when it comes to the spread of misinformation.\n\nSound bites and videos of her saying marriage is between one man and one woman over a decade ago do not nullify her record. Also let's not pretend that gay rights are limited to marriage.",

I can understand being gay, but why does this necessitate being effeminate or speaking with a lisp?\n\nWhy a person behaves the way they do isn't always easy to explain.  This could be partly due to social groups - acting differently when you're around various groups (parents, chess club, sports team).  It might be a conscious choice, but I'd suspect it's also a natural way to fit in with that group.  It could also be a person's natural (or \"default\", if you will) mannerisms, however they're developed.\n\nBeing flamboyant also increases visibility.  It makes it easier to identify other gay/bi men, for example (to an extent - being flamboyant or effeminate is not confined to gay men).  Others have mentioned this might be especially strong after coming out, as a reaction to finally being free.\n\n\n>Like it or not, mannerisms come into play when I decide my friends. If someone is constantly making a scene, acting as an effeminate male, and always begging for attention, this is really not a person that I have any interest in being friends with.\n\nYou mention three things here.  One of those stands out.  \"Acting as an effeminate male\" seems out of place with \"constantly making a scene\" and \"always begging for attention.\"  They can overlap, but I think it's unfair to associate being an effeminate male with attention-seeking.\n\n> I just find ultra flamboyantly gay individuals to be annoying and detrimental to the gay rights movement as a whole.\n\nGLBT rights are about equality and acceptance for all orientations and gender identities.  Along with that includes mannerisms, gender roles.  It's not reasonable for someone to have to hide, or constrain how they present themselves in order to gain that equality.  Acceptance of glbt people involves breaking societal norms.  Flamboyance and effeminancy amongst men (not the same thing) is a part of that.\n\n----\n\nDoes it bother you that some men are effeminate?  How do you perceive non-gay/bi effeminate men?  Do you consider being effeminate with being flamboyant?  Why would this affect gaining equal rights?  Is there something wrong with flamboyancy or a man being effeminate?",

This can be an attempt to feel out their level of comfort and self-identity after making a dramatic change in their life (coming out), this can be an attempt sub-consciously to test whether friends and family REALLY support their decision, this can be \"making up for lost time\", or it can be youthful immaturity.  Or a combination of the above.  As has also already been mentioned, most people grow out of the obnoxious levels of loudness, just as most obnoxious loud young straight people eventually calibrate a level of social propriety.\n\n**Effeminate = flamboyant**:  Since you specifically point out gay men acting effeminately and not butch lesbians (or other variations of social gender-variant behavior) I would suggest that your discomfort is with femininity and not flamboyance.  (\"Femininity\" being used in this case to specifically reference the behaviors and attitudes commonly associated with females, not referencing the female sex as a whole.)  You wouldn't be alone in this discomfort - masculinity is often depicted as authentic, minimalist, strong and true... \"take it like a man\", \"man up\", \"be a man\" (and tell the truth), etc.  Femininity is perceived as artificial, deceptive, weak, etc etc etc... \"feminine wiles,\" \"putting her face on\", \"just like a woman\", etc etc etc.\n\nThe thing is, there are always male-identified people who are going to act \"feminine\", and there are female-identified people who are going to act \"masculine\" - and those men acting feminine are going to be assumed to be gay, whether they are or not.  What needs to happen, moreso than feminine behaviors being vilified and flamboyant gay men being told to \"act more straight\" is a learned acceptance of femininity as neither superior nor inferior to masculinity, but simply a different expression of self.  If you're curious about the demonization of femininity, I suggest reading _Whipping Girl_ by Julia Serano.",

How homosexuality is inherited/develops is not fully understood at this point so there really is no clear cut answer, and with most nature/nurture questions, it's probably hella complicated.\n\nJust accept the fact that they are acting in a way that they are comfortable, and that's that.",

              "body": "For me (as a gay male myself), I find flamboyance in an individual to be one of two things:  A persona, constructed for a purpose because of its qualities, or an actual part of someone's real personality that they are born with despite societal influence.\n\nIf it's the first, I usually question the person's use of such a persona.  Are they trying to grab attention?  Do they know they're purporting the stereotype that most/all homosexuals act this way?  Are they doing it to make fun of our own?  The examples and questions go on, but my point here is that there's usually a reason and it's not usually a good one...  And I usually don't respect that person that much because they're using flamboyancy out of it's natural context which is typically seen in a negative light in society due to society's mentality of \"men should act like men and women should act like women.\"\n\nWhich brings me to the latter explanation of it actually being part of someone's personality.  We've all seen it before, or experienced it first hand.  This is when a man acts in an effeminate manner all the time, from a young age and into adulthood.  I want to express that this is a natural occurrence and should just be seen as another facet of how personality, sexuality, gender roles and identity exists in our world.  And just how there are men who are predominantly effeminate there are females who are predominantly masculine.  To me, personally, I have no problems with gay guys who are like this.  I've actually dated guys on all sides of the spectrum (overly str8 acting [high masculine], super-flaming [high feminine], androgynous [high levels of masculine AND feminine qualities], and not masculine or feminine at all [this is actually called asexual or 'without sex/gender']).  To me it doesn't matter because there are so many other important qualities that matter to me waaay more and I can really relate to both masculine and feminine characteristics myself.\n\nSo in examining your question and coming up with my answer, I'd like to put my own spin on it.\n\nWe can see that a lot of people share this lack of understanding as to why some gay men act in a way that is seen as \"overly effeminate.\"  This thread is kind of a testament to that.  So instead of trying to understand why some homosexual men act this way, why don't we ask ourselves why our society (I'm talking American/European societies/cultures as many other cultures embrace this behavior and don't even have set gender roles) views this as a behavior that is not 'normal'?\n\nOur society is one that is deeply invested in building, maintaining, and assuming gender roles.  What is a gender role?  A gender role is a construct of social attitudes and behaviors that are considered to be the 'norm' within a given society.  Our society's example is how boys are brought up to embody masculine qualities while girls are brought up have feminine qualities, both of which our own society has already planned out for both sexes.  The hardship of falling outside these stereotypical societal 'norms' is seen when an individual (male or female) does not embody their expected role (masculine and feminine, respectively).  Society begins to criticize, criminalize, discriminate, and even physically/emotionally punish these individuals for just being who they are.  To me, this is where the real misunderstanding is.  And this is where the change and understanding needs to happen.  You gotta think, these gender role boxes don't just hurt the lgbt people, they hurt all men and women who feel like stepping out of their gender roles.  This discrimination and misunderstanding happens whenever a man feels like talking about how he's feeling rather than just \"getting over it\" and \"manning up.\"  It's not homosexual to want to talk about what's happening in your life or how you're feeling.  It is homophobic to think that it is, though...\n\nTo sum it up:  Instead of asking yourself, \"Why does that person act that way?\" try asking yourself, \"Why does the society that I live in today see that person's natural behavior as not normal, and why do I have to feel awkward or uncomfortable about that particular individual's personality and behavior?\"  Really, you'll come to see that it's not the individual who is wrong in the way that he or she acts, it's the way we, as a society, were programmed to see them as 'not normal' that is.\n\nWhew!",

I love cock. In the classic sense, yes, I do consider myself to be a masculine gay man. I am my own man, though. \n\nI am not considered to be a masculine gay by both communities... People like yourself in the gay community discriminate against me because I am not \"gay\" enough. Straight guys discriminate against me because I do not share their passion for sports... So I can't be a real man because I find sports boring as hell. I am not pandering to either side... I could not care less if straight guys accept me or if \"flamer\" gay guys accept me... But I don't understand the hypocrisy. \n\nWhy can there not be a spectrum like there is in the straight community? Men in the straight community can be as butch or as sensitive as they want but their orientation is not questioned as much by their peers, I am sure of it. Why can't it be that way in the gay community? Well, I have a wake call... it is that way in the gay community. We are here, we are queer, and we aren't going anywhere, dammit. ",

Just like some men are attracted to blond/surfer guys and some are attracted to brunette/sensitive guys. (No correlation between hair color..just an example) I am attracted to the masculinity of man. I always have been. That is partly why women are not attractive to me...not to mention the ugliness of a vagina...but the daintiness of a woman I am not attracted to... The body type of a woman I am not attracted to.  So of course the femininity of a man is a factor for me. Not because I am a self-loathing homophobic, as you put it, but it is simply because it is not my type.

                          "body": "Dannylandulf pegged it but let me try to approach it differently.\n\nALL societal behaviour is artificial. A society tends to say \"this is how our tribe acts\". This allows for identification of non-members. \"He has a beard??? He's a barbarian! Kill him!!!\".\n\nIf you take a hard look at the dominant groups in a society, you can see how stupid and artificial the 'rules' are. For example, wearing of ties. There's no function for a tie other than to send the signal \"Hey there! I am just like you!\". It's purely for that purpose. Likewise, men wearing suits when it's 100\u00b0 out. Stupid. But, again, it sends a signal.\n\nNow let's look at \"liberation\". \"Liberation\" is all too often a one way street: \"You can now look and act like a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant male! How LUCKY you are!\". As historical examples, women were 'allowed' to wear trousers and wear mannish suits. Likewise, blacks were 'allowed' to drop their accents (learned as part of being in another 'tribe' or societal group, and could now, legally, act like WASP males without being mocked.\"\n\nOf course, this is all bullshit. \n\nLiberation means you can act however you wish to. If women were truly liberated, men would start wearing women's clothing. WASPs would speak with black accents. O! Wait! Men started wearing earrings! And not just in one ear. Turn on Jerry Springer or hang out in some parts of your town, and you can hear white kids talking 'black'. Men wear pink. (Interesting note, originally, the colours for male and female were the *opposite* of what they are today: men wore pink and women wore blue.\n\nThis process is, historically, takes a very long time to happen. And, it's stupid. We are gifted with this incredible brain that is built to detect patterns (\"Are you part of my tribe?\") but is also capable of this wonderful thing called intelligence.\n\nOnce you realize the tribal nature of societal norms and how artificial they are, we can now use our intelligence to make this incredible leap: \"Hey! It doesn't matter what someone looks like or how they talk or how they dress or the colour of their skin or \u2026 - ALL that matters is what a person DOES.\"\n\nIt doesn't matter if your male boss likes to put on a dress and hang out in bars insisting to be called Mrs. Haversham (thank you Scrubs). What matters is does your boss produce results. In fact, it doesn't matter (here's where Scrubs fell short) if your male boss wears a dress to work and insists on being called Mrs. Haversham. All that matters is if your boss gets the work done.\n\nAnytime you think: \"Why can't they just act like me?\", the problem is with you not 'them'. You're still using the outdated but historically useful in an evolutionary sense part of your brain that identifies if the caveman you see is part of your tribe or not. \n\nYou say: \"The flamboyance comes off as annoying, childish, and unintelligent.\". See, tribal mind at work. That's exactly the same thing as saying: \"Blacks should do what I tell them to or I get to beat them\" or \"Why can't women be happy taking care of babies and the house.\" \n\nWhen you find your tribe mind at work, give it a cookie and put it back in bed where it belongs. Take the time to see if you're expecting other people to act like you do. Ask yourself whether it matters one iota how they act or speak. \n\nAnd use the tests I've given above to test whether you are doing simply 'pattern recognition' or actually using your intelligence to rationally compare. Here are some more tribal things that are outdated: Men used to show their wealth by being portly: \"Look, I make so much I can consume more than others. Food prices aren't worth my worry.\". Likewise, it used to be very unfashionable to have a tan: \"Look how pale I am! *I* don't work in the fields!\".\n\nI am not picking on you, translatepure. I am picking on all of us. We tend to take false pride in having the ability to recognise patterns. We tend to not use our intellect to truly analyse. \n\nTo recap: Ask yourself if you're using Mr. Lizard Brain or all of the beautiful grey matter that we've since overlaid on Mr. Lizard Brain. If you're bleeding to death does it matter if your doctor is someone wears a tutu or has a tattoo on their forehead that says \"Look at me! I'm intelligent!\" or says \"Hey, girlfriend!\" whenever they wish or even wears a three-piece suit and tie? Would you say \"No, let me bleed to death, you're too strange!\" or would you cry out: \"Help me?\". Sometimes it takes an extreme example to realise how stupid Mr. Lizard Brain really is.\n\nThere is a final, albeit apocryphal, example: the black doctor who invented blood transfusion was grievously injured when the automobile he was driving went out of control and turned over. Drew suffered extensive massive injuries was denied a blood transfusion by an all-White hospital. And he died before he could get to a 'black' hospital. \n\nIt didn't really happen that way (sorry, MASH) but the story is illustrative.\n\nHave fun!",

I don't have links to the papers on hand, but there have been case studies on the personalities of identical twins over time, determining how environment affects two individuals with the same genetic makeup.  Some were separated at birth, some identified with different groups, etc, but the ultimate conclusion was that there were some similar traits exhibited by the two regardless of outside influence and, as expected, peer groups and other outside influences also determined differences in behavior.\n\nDo people choose to have a speech impediment? I doubt it, and this problem isn't isolated to the gay community.  But do some gay people choose to act effeminate if they identify more with others who are flamboyantly gay? Perhaps.  Is it also linked with hormone levels? Maybe.  Do some females choose to act effeminate due to societal expectations or identity with girly-girls?  Perhaps.  Is it also linked with estrogen levels?  Quite possibly.  Do some straight men choose to act masculine if they identify with more macho peer groups?  Maybe.  Does it have to do with testosterone levels?  Perhaps.  You can probably see where I'm going with this.\n\nIn any case, many ultra conservatives don't even consider sexuality or gender-identity to be a result of genetics.  In some of their minds, it can be considered a moot point how effeminate vs. less obvious behavior came about in certain individuals since a gay person chooses to be gay, therefore all behavior would be by choice.  I don't think it would help the LGBT community one way or the other if flamboyantly gay individuals decided to cover up their personalities under a macho facade.",

Actually \"fag\" is sometimes, and in that sense it does not offend me. It's a word. Why doesn't the word couch bother me when so many people have been raped on couches? Because it's a word that in and of itself has nothing to do with badness or evil. The badness or evil comes in context - if someone gets mad at me and calls me a \"fag\" or \"kike\" as a result, you best believe they'll get a punch to the face for it. But if someone doesn't like a movie and they say that's gay? That doesn't mean it's homosexual. Just like if they call some guy who cuts them off in traffic a \"moron\" they're not slighting people who are mentally-handicapped (which is what that word means) and when they say Nickelback is lame they're not disparaging people with physical disabilities. It's just a word.\n\nHeteronormative may not be a bad word, but the LGBT community has declared it a bad word. Like \"gay\". When they're pissed off at something that goes wrong in their lives, they declare it a crime of the \"Heteronormative\" culture they happen to be stuck in. And this bothers me for many reasons, but mostly the same reason that I'm annoyed by that woman who calls Joss Whedon a rapist - because actual rapists exist, and they worked really hard to get that title. Using a power word like that diminishes a young boy being beaten by his father for liking other boys against the backdrop of someone complaining about a douchebag frat boy who doesn't know not to call the music at the party \"gay\".

For example I consider a wild difference between transgender/gay slurs and transphobia/gayphobia, as those who use slurs aren't necessarily hateful or phobic and might actually use sexist and racial slurs as well(in jest).\n\nNow, another thing I would like to mention is that the word heternormative doesn't hold any special power. Accepting yourself(if that is the case) as heteronormative doesn't make you a bad guy, a rapist, a hate crime bully, or anything else. It just means you are a heterosexual male. The word just means the normal of a given group(this group being humanity) and has no inherently negative connotations unless you apply them. It is just to establish a baseline from where you are coming from.\n\nThe reason why people do get upset over the word gay being thrown it is the same reason people get upset over the n and j word which are racial slurs. You might think there is a wild difference between the two subjects, but the fact is a lot of gay and transgender people have been killed through the centuries. There have been persecutions and outright torture so there is a lot of pain behind these words. You might consider the pain insubstantial, even pedantic, but then you must at the same time consider any group's attitude towards a word pedantic, whether it be nigger, jap, kike, fag, or tranny.\n\nSo is all use of the word heteronormative justified?

This also gives that same message to the next door neighbor who beats him up at school.  \n\nSame with a transexual girl who grows up not allowed to express her true gender or is teased at school for presenting a certain way, or watches how transgendered people are depicted in the tv and media, as people who are somehow lying about who they are.\n\nWhen you laugh when your best friend says fag you may know what he really means but the homophobe listening to your conversation may not know...  Do you see what I am saying?  On a level you are conveying that being a fag is wrong, and is acceptable for use as an insult. Regardless, of your connotation of the word, that is how it will inevitably be taken by some, and even by you on a certain level.\n\nYou need to understand that it is all correlated",

I'm not saying websites shouldn't add a third gender or that guy at work shouldn't stop using \"gay\" as a reflex word for things he doesn't like. What I AM saying is that not everything is a fight, not everyone is trying to offend you, and not all homophobia is equal. And \"Heteronormative\" pretends that it is. It pretends that the circumstances of some straight guy jokingly calling his best friend a \"fag\" are the exact same thing as Matthew Shepard being beaten and left to die.

If the latter, I have to wonder why. What is the purpose of defending your pansexuality so vehemently? It seems hardly worth the time and effort to explain to those who probably won't understand. Pansexual does mean attracted to all in the gender spectrum, but all that exists in the gender spectrum is male, female, and various blends of the two. It seems to me like someone who does identify as bisexual can just as easily be attracted to everyone you are. \n\nI guess what I'm really trying to ask is why do you care if people don't understand? You're still you whether they get it or not. I may be being insensitive here and, if so, I apologize. I'm transsexual and I reached a point a few years ago where I stopped requiring those around me to understand what I am and why I am what I am. Some people will never understand and I don't require them to. \n\nOnce again, please don't think that I'm dismissing your post or sexuality. The reason I ask is that I've known several people in my life who go out of their way to engage in disputes over sexuality in an attempt to force comprehension and understanding on others. To me this always seemed like insecure behavior, using others as a conduit to reinforce to themselves what they feel they are. I'm **not** accusing you of this but, for those who do behave this way, I have to wonder what the point is. \n\nBe you, do you, and don't worry about what others think is what I say :)\n\nBut I could be wrong.

To some, yes, it means \"I just want non trans, cisgendered/sexed males and females, and that's it,\" but to many, it just means \"I don't just like boys/just like girls.\"\n\nSo, yes, if we're being completely PC, they're two absolutely completely different things. But, people who are bisexual aren't intending to discount the gender identities or physical sexes of those outside the binary spectrum, in most cases. I do think many self identified pansexuals can be TOO aggressive in defending/arguing for their sexuality, and I think that most pansexual folk shouldn't be so quick to jump on bisexuals (which does often happen) about being 'close minded' and whathaveyou.",

It feels like shit to admit sometimes, but yes, I understand what you're saying. Sometimes it's not so much the adversity you'll face for being in a homosexual relationship, but simply missing out on all of the \"normal-ness\" you could get from a heterosexual relationship. \n\nI guess this is where I start speaking out of my ass - the truth is, I don't know what it's like to be in love. I have no idea what it's like to actually be with someone, and have that kind of relationship that people strive for. Real, true love, I guess. But my theory is that if you're with someone you really, truly love... those things won't matter. Sure, you'd miss the normalcy, but you wouldn't be envious, because you also wouldn't give up what you have with that person for anything. That's my theory about what it's like to really be in love, at least. \n\nMaybe, if you look at it like that, the real issue is that after two years you're starting to realize that you don't love this guy enough to see an enduring future with him. Maybe you're problem isn't necessarily that you need to be with a woman and have that normalcy, but rather that you need to be with someone that you love so much that you don't care anymore about stuff like that and couldn't imagine being happier despite their gender, male or female.\n\nOf course, I'm also wholly open to the idea that someone could come along and say \"This guy has no idea what relationships are about. That's not an obtainable thing, love is about something else entirely\" and that would be that. But that's one thing to think about.\n",

From that bit of your post, it sounds more like your primary reason for wanting to do this is to not disappoint your family... which I'm sure I don't have to tell you is a little silly. \n\nIn either case, I'll say it anyway: Whatever you choose to do, whoever you choose to be with, your family needs to be the one who accommodates you. As your family, one of the few big responsibilities they have in terms of their relationship with you is to support you and your choices as long as they aren't hurting you. Making the decision of who to spend your life with based on what will be easiest for them to accept would be doing yourself a tremendous disservice.   \n\n",

We have a very 'gay' lifestyle of brunches, gay travels, gay clubs, events and vacations. \n\nBut I feel that as I'm getting older, it's time to 'settle down' so to speak. I come from an Italian family and I'm the only male to carry on the family name. All my siblings are girls and the other male heir died in a motorcycle accident a few years back.\n\nI want children. I have a strong need for a son or daughter. And more if God is willing. \n\nMy family is definitely okay with me being 'gay' with my boyfriend but they're implying that it had better be 'temporary' so to speak. Even heard my mother say 'let him have his fun for now'.\n\nAnd I think 'fun times' are over. I don't want to hurt my boyfriend but I have to start looking for a wife while I got some youth left in me. \n\nI've talked to my big sister and she thinks I'm a major asshole (she has a point) and that if I want kids I should just adopt or vitro.

Just as I was starting to realize that being gay could actually lead to a good, rewarding life, evidence presented on here screamed the opposite. Gay relationships fell apart and ended in misery for everyone. There isn\u2019t a single place I\u2019ll ever live where being gay is okay. Every gay person gets beaten up, shot, or set on fire. Countries are making laws left and right abridging our freedoms setting our cause back. I found it far from comforting. It felt like as I was just starting to get comfortable in a world I knew little about, it was becoming darker and scarier on every refresh. In fact, after reading a few too many posts about how \u201ceveryone hates the gays\u201d I asked /r/lgbt where good places for gays to live are, because it didn\u2019t really seem like there were any. I\u2019ve since come to find that being gay can be pretty great on my own, and I\u2019m much happier now than I ever have been, but just from reading /r/lgbt, the average person would likely doubt that \u201cit gets better.\u201d \n\nI discovered /r/gaymers a few months later and it felt like a wonderful breath of fresh air. People liked each other. People posted pictures of happy relationships. People had fun. It was nice. Being gay can be fun. It isn\u2019t all about doom-and-gloom. Yesterday I got a package in the mail containing a cool t-shirt, a really nice engineering pencil, a few other neat, fun items, and a nice heartfelt, handwritten card as part of the /r/gaymers gift exchange. Something like that would never happen on /r/lgbt. People are going to bash. It\u2019s inevitable. And I can understand the occasional post on /r/gaymers about how morose everything on /r/lgbt is because, in my experience, it\u2019s pretty damn gloomy.",

Gaymers is the first online community that actually makes me want to participate IRL.  There was a meetup near where I'm from (Boston), and I was legitimately disappointed that I missed it because I was away at school.  That is a feeling that [/r/lgbt](/r/lgbt) has never given me.

It's tiresome. Hell - *this* post is about something \"horrible\" happening to our community. Looking at the front page of /r/lgbt right now, there are four happy-ish posts and 21 unhappy posts.\n\nA response to the original post:\n\n>I'm not going to throw myself into the ring but from my (limited) observations:\n\n>/lgbt - LOOK HOW UNFORTUNATE AND MISTREATED WE ARE\n\n>/gaymers - LOOK HOW AWESOME AND FUN WE ARE\n\nIs pretty accurate.\n\n\nAnd let's be honest. This is not a community that takes any sort of criticism or dissent well. Anything that isn't obsequiously liberal or pro-gay-rights is raged to hell. I'm going to say it (at great risk to my account's karma): I'm a Republican (*gasp*, \"oh god, you self-loathing gay, you\" \"why do you hate all of us *so much*\" \"What's wrong with you? You're sick. You're 'worse than an ex-gay'\"), and I'm more pro-gay rights than most democrats. But a single mention of that turns me into some subterranean Bachmannesque troll-creature on this subreddit. Why? I have no idea. The LCR was pretty instrumental in the repeal of DADT and strongly supports OutServe. I usually feel like if you're anything short of occupying-everything-in-the-universe-liberal and \"everyone should be encouraged to do and be everything\" on this subreddit, you pretty much get flamed to hell.\n\nLike most things, I doubt /r/lgbt is going to change any time soon.

I come here to look, because occasionally there are gems of comedy and positivity, but you can't deny that this subreddit is by and large a serious place.  It is more about news and new laws and other such topics that are, generally, sobering in nature.\n\nYou also can't deny that some of people that post and comment here are self-righteous, set in their ways, and don't take criticism well.  I once got into a heated argument on here with two users who insisted that using the term \"Agnostic\" to describe my religious beliefs was wrong because it didn't give enough information about which side I lean towards.  They went on and on about how I should change the way that I talk about myself to a way that they deemed \"correct.\"  They refused to accept the fact that I was completely happy before they decided to correct me, and that I didn't, and don't, care enough about it to make my life more complicated for the sake of \"clarity.\"  It was juvenile.  \n\nI would also like to point out that the quote was posted in a thread on [/r/gaymers](/r/gaymers), a subreddit that is all about the happy lgbt stuff.  There are the occasional \"can you guys help me I want to come out\" posts, but by far it is mostly pictures of hot guys, videogames, fun, jokes, flirting, and sex tips.  It is in many ways the polar opposite of [/r/lgbt](/r/lgbt), and the users there tend to avoid this subreddit because it is too serious for their tastes.  The majority of gaymers, myself included, think of reddit as a place to have fun, and serious posts kind of break that.\n\n---\n\nThe unfortunate fact of the matter is that you are probably going to rage at me.  Looking at your recent posts, it appears that you have gotten in an argument over the merits and flaws of [/r/lgbt](/r/lgbt) in that thread on [/r/gaymers](/r/gaymers), and it looks like it has gotten the slightest bit out of hand.

Instead, I'll just point out that the condition of being Gay is one of those characteristics that do not define who we are as a group. You are gay, but for all I know you could be rich or poor, white or black or yellow or brown, liberal or conservative, religious or atheist, high-school dropout or Ph.D.-holding rocket scientist. So I think something needs to be said about respect and patience for each other in spite of disagreements or different ways of seeing things. Because, we're all stupid.\n\nEDIT: Downvote away! You're all dumb who do it.",

Being angry itself is not wrong or right. You can't be judged upon you're feeling towards something. Wrong or right in this context are concepts that deal with action. So as long as you don't let your anger drive you to beat up efeminate guys, or mistreat them in any other way, you're in the clear.\n\nI can advise you to do some soul searching as to why they make you angry. Most likely they make you angry, because how en who they are has certain consequenses for how you view yourself. And here we go off the tarmac of straight forward conceptual reasoning and on to the bumpy byroad of new age bullshit and Freudianism. I can't keep this shit up.\n\nI try to enjoy the overly efeminate guys I encounter (this goes as far as drag queens), because I myself would rather see people smile than frown when I express myself. At least they're making the most of their freedom and imagine how much more boring a gay pride would be without them.",

I just think the cross dressing and make-up part is ridiculous and I can't take it seriously. And I'm not alone in that, numerous of my straight mates think the same way. \n\nAnd thing is, there are exceptions to every rule. I know a guy who is an effeminate gay and he wears makeup from time to time. But he's a cool bloke so I let him do what he wants. I just take it as a tongue-in-cheek, crazy young guy thing probably because I know him to be quite a joker. But regardless, I'm cool with it. But when people try too hard it just annoys me. And annoys a lot of people. It's jarring and unnecessary. Nothing to do with the stereotype. I've said in the past, I couldn't care less how the rest of the community want to act. I've grown up to realize that people will take you for who you are. Once they know me they know I am not like that. Hell some people assume I still have a feminine side, and I don't care about that, just when they ask me to go clothes shopping or go for a dance I am like \"lol no, now leave me with my bros and my whiskey, we are discussing last night's match\".\n\nEDIT: I have deviated slightly. Back on track, basically I don't see the issue in people who DO feel somewhat oppressed by the stereotype, and therefore resenting the stereotype. No one likes stereotypes. I'm sure a lot of black people go out their way to make it clear that they aren't looking to steal bikes and mug you. Whether it is positive or negative I guess stereotypes aren't nice, and some people must hate that. Yes I see your point, you can't judge people for acting the way they act. However there are people like me who sincerely find that attitude and behavior obnoxious anyway. I am from a respectable family and I have learned to not try to stand out and seek attention. Dress down, casual or well-dressed, but simply not out-of-the-ordinary. Be respectful to those around you in public, don't be loud, don't be shouting out sexual obscenities, etc. These people, part of the stereotype or not, aren't so respectful to the passers by. They are displaying themselves in a flamboyant and in-your-face way. It's unpleasant. If I had my way it isn't as if I would pass a law to prevent them doing so, but in terms of an impulse, I don't particularly like it.",

There is also a desire to disprove this stereotype. We would like other people to know that we are not different and thus, should not be treated differently (at least, that is my personal analyses).\n\nThe first problem with the stereotype is, that it is part of basic human cognition to think in stereotypes of some kind. Call it conceptual schemes, designators, names, language game rules; it all comes down to a simplification of reality, by choosing the most common (or visual) occurence of a phenomenon. \n\nThe second problem is, there are cases where it fits. There are very efeminate gay guys and I think it is safe to say that there is a significantly higher percentage of efeminate gay men then efeminate straight men. \n\nThe third problem is, that we are discussion acts of a moral agent. Whithin the culture these situations most commonly arise, there is a fundamental believe that people should be able to act/behave the way they want to as long as they don't harm another. \n\nSo in conclusion: 1. People will have stereotypes and these are based upon the most visual occurence of a phenomenon, like the efeminate gay guy. 2. The stereotype is not (entirely) based upon fiction. There is a greater percentage of efeminate gay guys and through things like gay prides these people are more visible. 3. We can't really judge these people for how they act unless we are harmed by it, because they have the freedom to behave the way they want.\n\nWe would need to make a case, that efeminate gay people are harming us. In a way they are harming the emancipation of lgbt. But this would mean we are going to curb their freedom to act as they are, because we want to be able to be gay without having to suffer a stereotype.\n\nThe question is: are you willing to curb someones self-expression, because it means you have to deal with a stereotype? Will you tell people they shouldn't be gay the way they want, because you feel you can't be gay the way you want?\n\ntl-dr: You can't force someone not to be efeminate gay, because you want to be able to be masculine gay and fit in to the gay stereotype.",

On average, gay men are probably a little more feminine than straight guys (We are a spectrum of masculine/feminine behaviour so some gay guys are going to be more masculine and some are going to be more feminine). The area of the brain that governs sexual orientation also governs gendered behaviour. brain structure rarely act so completely in isolation. As such, differences in sexual orientation are going to often spill over into gendered behaviour.  (incidentally, this is why gaydar exists. )\n\nIt's not an act. It's who we/they are. You're letting your own confirmation bias (because the feminine gays stand out) fuel your internalized homophobia. And yes, it's internalized homophobia. You've accepted your own sexuality with a condition where \"As long as I'm masculine, having sex with guys is okay. I still measure up.\"\n\nIt's not enough that we simply accept that some people like their own gender. That's not the line in the sand. **The line in the sand is where everyone in the GSM community get to be and love as they choose.** \n\nLastly, remember, we/they are the front line. When some were hiding behind a veneer of \"straight acting\" when they were in the closet, the feminine gay boys were getting their ass kicked and paving the way of acceptance because they had no other option. They didn't choose it. They just did the best they could with what they were given.\n\nIt wasn't the gender-conformist protesters that changed things for the better. It was the drag queens at stonewall that had enough and rioted. **We owe gender-non-conformity our respect.**",

Simple disagreement is not oppression.   \n\nRemember when I said \n\n\"When someone calls for \"straight pride\" as a basic analog to \"LGBTETC pride\", they are either grossly trivializing the struggles of the LGBTFTW community or they are grossly exaggerating their own hardships as a cis straight person. \"? \n\nYou're doing that now. \n\n>Also, maybe you shouldn't assume heterosexuals wanting a hetero pride don't have solid reasons to claim such event. Ask those who thought about it, maybe they will have a valid reason. \n\nWhereas straight people aren't actually being oppressed anywhere, the only valid reason for holding a straight pride rally is because they feel like it. Which is fine; throw a damn party if you want one so bad and have a damn parade if you want one so bad. Don't think you have to justify it with a political message, especially when the purported  political message is just obvious made-up nonsense. \n\n",

Wartime atrocities (such as mass murder of civilians) are enabled by dehumanization; the more widespread sentiments of \"our enemies aren't really people\" are, the more you'll see those atrocities. Everyone who comments that \"those people\" deserve pain and death is contributing to the end result, but we wouldn't treat someone who expresses racist views exactly as you would the hypothetical racist KKK murderer; those people's words may have convinced the KKK guy that black people don't deserve to live (or deserve to live less than white people), but they didn't pull the trigger. I think most people would agree that telling someone who says \"black people aren't human\" or \"they're not capable of being civilized like we are\" to shut the fuck up is *obviously* different from responding to \"everyone deserves basic human rights\" with a solid STFU.\n\nIn some situations, it may be a moral requirement to tell someone to shut up. Doxxing is very often regarded as inappropriate behavior; if someone is shouting the personal information of another person on the street corner (or a digital equivalent, posting a person's full name, address, SSN, etc. on reddit), yelling over them might be a very justified response (or on reddit, getting that post deleted and the posting account banned).\n\nSo again, we can see that in many situations, it is perfectly proper to tell someone to shut up. If there is a reason to object to this behavior, it will be rooted in the context surrounding that behavior, not simply the behavior itself. (This is true even with extreme examples--murder is nearly universally seen as wrong, but we make exceptions in wartime for soldiers killing soldiers. Most would concede that it was moral for the allies to murder Nazi soldiers during battles in WW2.)\n\n>some speech is dangerous but only if it come out of the limits of opinions and it have repercussions on society in a agressive way\n\nDo you believe that opinions cannot have negative repercussions on society? What if that opinion were \"white men shouldn't have any legal rights\"? What if everyone held that opinion? Voicing your opinion in public is an action that carries consequences, even if they are only as small as other people thinking, \"Well that's completely stupid. Of course white men should have equal rights. This person is an idiot.\" But if a majority already believed that white men shouldn't have legal rights, this form of speech would be a lot more threatening--a lot more dangerous to white men.\n\n>[a person who] starts riots to kill all people he/she considers intolerant\n\nThis person is clearly in the wrong. But they're engaging in physical violence and murder, not simply what most people would consider censorship. (Although it's clearly true that you can't voice your opinion if you're dead, so in a way, it's the ultimate form of censorship.)\n\n>[a person who says] the exact same thing but waiting to get power through the choice of the people ...  because he/she didn't achieve his/her goal by violence\n\nI'm not sure I'm interpreting your words in a way that you mean them to be. Let me try to clarify.\n\nAre you saying that a person who says \"there shouldn't be racism\" and uses the democratic process to create laws the endorce that position, you're okay with this? With no other consideration? I doubt very much you'd approve of laws which say \"racists will be executed on sight.\"\n\nPerhaps you would be firmly opposed to laws which impose violence, but that's also very shaky ground--how exactly do we construe \"violence\"? Clearly a person applying physical force to cause damage (or death) to another person is violence, but what about locking them in jail? Most people don't consider that violent, but what if you lock them in jail and then refuse to feed them? You're causing them to die, but is this violence?\n\nWhat about official laws which restrict a group's legal rights? Does this kind of official legal caste system constitute violence against the oppressed group(s)? Is such a system morally defensible?\n\nHow about an *unofficial* caste system, one in which someone who belongs to a certain group doesn't actually have access to the same rights as the majority, even though the laws ostensibly apply to everyone? ([*De jure* equality but *de facto* inequality?](https://onlinelaw.wustl.edu/blog/legal-english-de-factode-jure/)) Is this kind of system morally defensible?\n\nIf one or both of those systems is morally defensible, is attempting to use the democratic process to create such a system morally defensible? Is *this* form of speech violence?\n\nNow of course, you might want to answer that these social structures may not be \"violence\" but are still immoral, but if you were on the receiving end of that inequality--if you felt the effects of such widespread discrimination every single day while watching other people benefit from this inequality--do you think you would see it in the same way you do now? Do you think you would perceive someone who advocates for *further* removal of your legal rights as engaging in a form of violence? Do you think you would agree that \"free speech\" should be interpreted to mean that someone should be allowed to argue with no consequences that you deserve to have your rights taken away? Do you think that you would approve of \"free speech\" being taken to mean that if you tried to tell this person to \"shut up\" that you were engaging in immoral censorship--that *you* were the one behaving immorally?",

For the KKK bigot, I'd say you are guilty because you're the cause of the harm. Even if this wasn't your intention, you clearly led to the death of that guy. For the other example, you're safe because you didn't told the man and it wasn't your intention to be heard by him.\n\nAnd yes, some speech is dangerous but only if it come out of the limits of opinions and it have repercussions on society in a agressive way. For example, betwwen a guy/girl saying \"there shouldnt be racism in our world\" and starts riots to kill all people he/she considers intolerant and a guy/girl saying the exact same thing but waiting to get power through the choice of the people, the second example is for me acceptable because he/she didn't achieve his/her goal by violence.

If there is no risk or threat of harm included, can something be considered censorship? When the government says \"you may not engage in Nazi propaganda,\" that carries with it a clear threat of incarceration--there is a visible consequence for espousing Nazi rhetoric, and choosing to do so results in jail time.

Based on what you've said, I infer you would interpret this as me directly causing harm to that man. You would assume that my intent was to get that racist to assault the other patron. You would, I assume, disapprove of my speech. You might even feel I should be put in jail for it.\n\nIf I were the sort of guy to enjoy airing other people's dirty laundry in public, and I had just watched a wife cheat on her husband, and I were to be laughing about this in a bar with my friends, and the husband happened to overhear it and then go home to murder his wife and whomever she was cheating on him with, I think it's safe to assume most people wouldn't expect me to be legally to blame for that (that is, people would generally think the husband should go to prison, and I should not).\n\nThere's a sliding scale of responsibility, and at some point on that scale--somewhere between these two examples--I think we would agree that words can create a context in which violence is likely to occur, even without the *intent* to create violence. Such speech actions are cause for concern even without the harm that results being \"direct\" or intended.\n\nUS law (you said you're French, so perhaps you have no familiarity with US law, but I'm from there, so it's what I know best) has [specific exceptions to the constitutionally-mandated category of free speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions), and I know that various other European countries apply stricter controls over this freedom. We take it as given that while free speech is vital to the functioning of a healthy democracy, some speech is actively *dangerous*. I am aware of no country on Earth in which words can never result in legal consequences, and there is certainly no social group in which words cannot result in *social* consequences. If our ideas of \"censorship\" do not account for this--if we construe literally *all* attempts to prevent *any* kind of speech as equivalent and immoral--then our ideas are flawed.",

It's important that we be able to have conversations about important issues, but discussions about whether or not certain groups deserve human rights aren't worth entertaining. They're *human* rights.\n\nThe extent to which a government should get involved in such discussions (e.g., by forbidding their discussion in public spaces, or by forbidding the advocacy of certain views) is a conversation worth having, but a lot of people don't seem interested in having an *honest* conversation about it. Countries like the UK construe free speech very differently from the US. Germany outright forbids Nazi rhetoric. The arguments about these things tend to be of the \"slippery slope\" variety (there's a reason that's the name of a logical fallacy), and it's *reasonable* to fear a government taking its powers too far, but it does not follow that a government being given the right to censor Nazi speeches must necessarily become totalitarian.\n\n>As long as they don't directly harm them, then it's tolerable\n\nThis is too vague. How do you construe \"direct\" harms? If dehumanizing speech becomes widespread, human rights violations often follow. A large part of wars involve dehumanizing one's opponents because when you've convinced your soldiers that their targets are just *too evil to live*, they don't hesitate to pull the trigger. Now obviously that's an extreme example, but we have more moderate examples, such as [this iconic pair](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v675/toxigal/yahoo1.jpg). Our reflexive views of people are shaped by social messaging; would the same news outlet really portray those two pictures with such wildly different captions in the absence of prejudice? Surely not.\n\n>I'm 99% sure heterophobes exist.\n\nConsidering the law of large numbers, statistically speaking, there must be at least one person out there who harbors some kind of violent intentions for all heterosexual people.

Changing the law and being accepted as they are by the population \n\nTo the extent that a lack of acceptance constitutes systemic disadvantages, sure. Though it's certainly conceivable to create social structures that remove these disadvantages without having universal social acceptance. (Affirmative action policies are one such attempt.)\n\nMore about social acceptance, though. Is it a good thing to accept everyone regardless of who they are and what they do? No. If someone advocates a position that you are inferior because of your identity, accepting that person's politics is harmful. Rejecting someone for embracing a harmful ideology is not equivalent to rejecting someone for a trait they were born with. Advocating \"tolerance\" while refusing to tolerate such a person is thus not hypocritical.\n\nI have no idea what the context is for your hypothetical \"lol heterosexuals\" thing, but saying that in response to a heterosexual person saying an ignorant or harmful thing doesn't endorse or create any system in which heterosexual people are deprived of equality.\n\nAs for that tweet, it looks identical to a homophobic message with \"homosexuals\" substituted with \"heterosexuals.\" Twitter's a pretty shitty medium for getting a point across without a context, so whether that person's trying to make some kind of political point, or a joke, I couldn't say. I have a very hard time imagining it being genuine when someone says all heterosexuals should commit suicide. Someone saying this seriously is an asshole, but society is still completely lacking in systemic disadvantages or social exclusion for heterosexuals, so they'd be an asshole without any sort of support for their opinions. Part of the harm in \"gays are gross\" sentiments is that they're widespread, directly reinforcing the disadvantages that already exist. Both positions might be distasteful, but they aren't equally harmful.",

For hundreds of years, if you weren't straight, you had to hide your sexuality because if people found out, you would be persecuted against.

That's weird.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI hope that by posting that, I'm not offending anyone. I genuinely want to know what you think. I also just want to say that I don't consider that everyone on this sub is part of the people that were tweeting the kind of tweets I mentioned above.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd if there're any grammar/spelling mistakes, sorry I'm french.",

Can a gay person call you something that would hurt your feelings because it ridiculed your sexual identity. \u201cCan\u2019t stand these breeders\u201d is as close as I have ever heard. However the power dynamic as a gay minority is different because they are oppressed by the majority in so many ways still today and often to the death. In some places labelling someone as \u201cgay\u201d is not just a joke or an insult. It is a death sentence and even a sentence to be ostracised by family and society. You may have used it in the past around gay people and frankly it may have been well timed and humorous. You shouldn\u2019t use it if you can\u2019t explain why it could be harmful or hurtful and if you can\u2019t expressly understand how it can harm or hurt others. I don\u2019t think we need to get rid of comedic wordplay for example how a faggot is a stick or a cigarette. This can be humorous to a point, but not if it\u2019s main push is to use it in a derogatory manner by labelling someone who is deficient in some way as being gay and that being gay is deficient or derogatory. It\u2019s all about what you mean and how you say it and the context of the situation. Thus u/133clouds response was perfect in its own way.",

This is not a judgemental post, just really curious of others opinions and experience? You have to wonder if people that post pictures in their underwear and offer to have web cam sex or meet others to hook up, like many do on here, would ever be capable of monogamy or being faihful? If that is a lifestyle habit they have developed, could they just be addicted to that type behaviour?

Try telling Stonewall veterans they should have tried to see the other side as human and they're the reason homophobia exists, because they won't be nice to people who wanted to deny them rights or let them die. It's respectability politics plain and simple. If we get angry (which for disabled, POC, etc queers literally existing can be interpreted as being angry) we don't deserve rights. If we're radical (anything more than very close to center left) we're to blame for the political divide. We can't win unless we're cis, abled, white, rich, centrists, etc and even then cishets (and a lot of other queer people tbh) will find something to pile on.\n\nSee also this quote from Anthony Oliveira: \"the queers who were nice/patient/gentle all got shot or bullied to death all that's left r me & the other pissed-off cockroach motherfuckers\". If cishets wanted nice queers they should've thought about that a long time ago.\n\nI'm rambling a bit but why is the onus on us to be nice? Why do I have to be nice to the guy who thinks it's a sin when I so much as look at another man and is not afraid to tell me? Why am I expected to put up with being called slurs? Why am I supposed to be kind and patient when someone says I should be killed? I've seen this on Tumblr a few times and my favorite response is that if they say they won't support us if we're angry then they wouldn't support us ever.\n\nWe forget where we come from and who we owe for our rights. I feel like as a community we need to remember our history, more than just \"the Stonewall riots happened\" and \"Black trans women started pride\". Our community has fought tooth and nail for everything we have and we need to appreciate that.\n\nEdit: everything in this thread is just r/EnlightenedCentrism",

Changing an anti-gay person's mind starts with gaining their respect - just like changing ANYONE'S mind about ANYTHING. If Ellen had been all bitchy and unfriendly to George W, what would he have thought? But she wasn't, she was friendly, and we saw him with a genuine smile on Ellen's video. \n\nSay he has more friendly encounters with gay people - maybe he already has. Over 12 years ago, Bush supported anti-gay laws, but would he today? If he continues to realize that gays are fun and friendly people, would he support those laws again? \n\nI can't be certain that he would change his mind, but I CAN be certain of one thing - if every LGBTQ person he meets is a dick to him, he'll never change.  \n\nNow take this, and scale it up. Think of all the homophobic people who saw Ellen and Bush getting along. Think how they may be one step closer to accepting Ellen as a cool, fun person, and not as \"that gay TV host.\" Think how this might change their stereotypes of the entire LGBTQ community. \n\nBeing friendly and nice isn't being silent. Sure, it's not fair. It's tough. But we're the ones fighting here, so we are the ones who have to gain the respect of the people whose minds we are trying to change. We're the ones that have to be kind. Being dicks won't get us anywhere.",

We'll kill you.\" Which makes sense considering the culture back then. A woman's bed belonged to her and only her, except occasionally when she allowed her husband in her bed. Even then, there were restrictions (See Leviticus 15).\n\nIn conclusion the verse does not forbid homosexuality (in fact it has little to do with homosexuality at all), but rather protects a woman's bed from people who aren't her trying to have sex in it, and I find that pretty reasonable...... except... ya know... the death part.\n\nquod erat demonstrandum\n\nSomeone correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Also LOTS of the other verses quoted in that site have this type of tone:   \"Maybe the people who wrote the Bible a word, so let's assume it was \"homosexual\" and run with that.\" And of course there are verses that are \"simply not\" open for interpretation. They've been interpreted and translated to English in a way that makes them very explicit. That's exactly what I'm arguing. However, if you can find a verse from the original Hebrew Bible that is clear and explicit in damnation of homosexuality, then that will be an interesting argument, something worth discussing.",

The Bible is not supposed to be the be all and end all of morality; its stories are supposed to serve as a path towards righteousness. \n\nJust because something is condemned solely within the context of pagan worship does not mean that it is morally acceptable -- for example, prostitution or incest. Faith does not excuse intellectual or moral laziness; we must also consider for ourselves whether our own ethical code (itself structured by our faith) finds these things acceptable. Does prostitution or incest cause harm? Arguably yes, in both cases. Does male same-sex sexual intercourse? No. In fact, it probably causes improvement in the lives of many.\n\nIn addition, whereas male same-sex intercourse is ostensibly condemned only in two passages within the context of prohibitions on pagan worship, many of these other prohibitions appear elsewhere. \n\n>but I do believe that it is likely that the authors of the bible were opposed to homosexuality.\n\nYou are conflating \"homosexuality\" and male same-sex sexual intercourse. It should be noted that at the time male same-sex intercourse was associated with the humiliation of the receptive partner (for example, anal rape was often used as a means of humiliating an enemy). It might be thus unsurprising that the authors of the Bible might have been disapproving of the prospect of treating another man \"as a woman.\" However, within the context of sexual acts between two equal partners, this is obviously not the case.

Words don't have single set meanings, so you can't simply say that some people are more correct than others.  The authorship of the Bible spans thousands of years and a vast array of literary genres, and no serious scholar will argue that it's internally consistent.  Hell, some groups (most notably Quakers) even believe that God continues to reveal new truths to humanity, and that sometimes this will involve radically reinterpreting or even discarding parts of the Bible.  But even if you don't subscribe to that sort of doctrine, any kind of Biblical exegesis involves a range of reading strategies that can very widely depending on the text, one's context, one's aims, one's audience, etc.  Margaret Mitchell, a New Testament scholar at the University of Chicago, has a wonderful article on this subject entitled [\"How Biblical is the Christian Right?\"](http://divinity.uchicago.edu/martycenter/publications/webforum/052006/commentary.shtml)  I'd recommend it to everyone here, as she thoroughly refutes the idea that the so-called Christian Right is some kind of authentic voice of what is truly Biblical or Christian.",

You don't have to spend your whole life worrying that you are doing something too much like the \"opposite sex.\" You just get to be you, wherever on the SPECTRUM of gender you fit.\n\nRainbow Flag.... Spectrum.... get it? It's not 1 color it's all the colors. It's not pink or blue it's both and everything else. And that's what the community is about. Just like the straight community we have traditionally feminine and masculine people, the difference is we acknowledge everyone else while they tend to be obsessed with promoting the dichotomy above representative reality.\n\nBut honestly, get over yourself. This isn't about the gay community, or the straight community, this is about you having issues being seen as feminine, even by association. \n\nIf the symbol of the gay community were more strictly masculine wouldn't that exclude the feminine men and women? But that would be ok because it's ok for girls to act more like boys right? This is latent sexism where feminine = bad and masculine = good. And don't give me bs about how it just \"doesn't represent you\" it's a Fing symbol, you get to decide what it means and what it represents. \n\nI see this symbol as being representative. To me it means diversity which means more than one thing. \n\nThe fact that as a symbol you are looking at it through the lens of a heteronormativity is really telling. The fact that you bring this question up the way you do is also telling. You're still trying to decide if you want to be associated with the gays. You're still wanting to be a straight guy who just has sex with guys. \n\nYou're 16, you're worried about gender perception, it's a little 12ish but ok everyone grows up on their own time. But you basically have a choice here, confront social stigma, or cow to it your whole life. Just be you no matter what combination of masculine/feminine you have, or spend every waking day trying to re-affirm and proclaim your masculinity by associating only with masculine stuff because you're terrified people won't validate you if you don't.\n\nBut put it this way, the gay community isn't going to say you can't be here because you're wearing a rainbow. Is there another group of people you know who might say that? If there is I know which group I would rather be a part of.\n\nRainbow's are about being who you are, whoever that is, the exact opposite of putting you in a box.",

Your perception on this matter will change as you grow familiar with it and its connotations.\n\nAnd when it comes to stereotypes, they are there for a reason. And most people understand that stereotypes doesn't apply to all people. You are who you are, and people you care about won't put you into stereotypical boxes.\n\nAbout feeling included in the LGBT community...

You seem to understand the history of it and what it's suppose to represent, but since that is not what you see it representing, it still bugs you. Is this a fair assessment or am I off?\n\nAnd I can see where you're coming from, when I first came out, I felt the majority of myself wasn't represented by what the rainbow represented. Yes there are aspects of me that fulfill the \"stereotype.\" I love musical theatre, I do like Lady Gaga, but I'm not sassy, I lack fashion sense, and I'm into science and video games (which never fit into what I viewed as gay, until I discovered Gaymers and such). However, after doing some thinking and soul searching, I came to the conclusion that this is why more people like me and like you should accept the flag and let others know.\n\nI came to this conclusion because I want others to realize that their view of the flag is wrong, that it portrays all of us. We are varied and don't fit into their narrowed views of the flag. That the more \"non-stereotypical\" people that come out and use the flag, the less it will only be perceived as the feminine gay.\n\nIt is probably because you are young still, and maybe you haven't had much exposure to the community, but when you do, you will see for sure, it is truly varied, and many of these people use the flag. There are lawyer's, doctors, factory workers, business men and women, construction men and women, and yes theatre people, fashion designers, and hairdressers. And when you see all of these people with a rainbow arm bracelet, a mini-flag pin, a rainbow flag, anything rainbow really, you start to realize, this doesn't mean what I thought it meant, and I want to contribute as well.

Just because stereotypes exist doesn't mean that you won't like the people. It's like saying that you hate being American because Americans are portrayed as ignorant fundamentalist Christians by many people. I'm a bit astounded with how you say you \"don't like the lgbt community\".\n\nI would suggest that you read the history of the gay pride flag first- the influence of hippie movement ( world peace, diversity, sexual freedom )is there.The rainbow flag is chosen not because of its feminine attribute, but because of the former symbols that I've mentioned earlier, due to the influence of the hippie movement back in the 60s. Should we change it? I still believe on its relevance- celebrating diversity is much more crucial now than ever, even. \n\nFurthermore, rainbow flag is not the only symbol used by the LGBT community. Do some research and you'll see that bisexuals, pansexuals, the bears and the S&M sub-community also have their own flags also. Also, the pink color is associated with the symbol Nazi soldiers attached to the gays sent in the concentration camps during the Holocaust. Adapting this painful memorabilia is to me a symbol of empowerment and connection to the past.\n\nSorry for the long comment.\n\nSincerely, \nA closeted gay Muslim born, raised and would still continue to live in my conservative, LGBT-repressive Muslim country . \n\n",

Put on a flag as a symbol, it represent the wide spectrum of LGBT people. Think of when you want to pick a colour in a computer program. They often have a colour wheel. You can choose any hue of of any colour. It's the same with the the rainblow flag and being LGBT. You can be any variety of LGBT, and the flag still is appropriate, since both are spectrums. If you want to be a super masculine gay male that only associates with other gay males that are just like you, that fits on the spectrum, as does a multitude of variations. So a bi person that dates only the opposite gender but has some attraction to the same gender can still fit.\n\nStereotypes generally come from the most visible, shocking, or just plain different things about a group. Some gay males aren't as visible, so instead the stereotypes form around the ones that are. Both are equally okay to be.",

Now before this discussion I was always pro gay adoption.\nBut my friend made some very interesting points and now my views have shifted a bit. \nI still believe that gay adoption should be allowed because having gay parents will be the same as, effectively having a single parent, which is of course legal and is quite common.\n\nBut neither are ideal, because with two fathers the child will be brought up with too much masculinity. With two mothers the child will be brought up with too much femininity. With a single parent of either sex, the same goes. As this friend said, you need all sides of the \"spectrum\" so-to-speak.\n\nThat being said, I read somewhere that this year there were only 50 adoptions (I can't remember if this was just UK or more countries), which is no matter which way you cut it... not much.\nSo I don't think we can in this day and age, be too fussy. If a person or couple seem suitable then they should not be denied. But my main view is that if there is a choice of allowing a child to be adopted by either a decent straight couple or a decent gay couple, I think the straight couple by default should have priority.\n------\nEDIT:\nOkay I see a lot of people are getting offended or pissed off with what I said. Hey people, this was just my opinion. I simply think a child needs both males and females in their life, particularly in the crucial part of growing up. If the situation is a girl getting adopted by two women or a boy getting adopted by two men, then I guess the situation is fine. Hell, I think it is fine for it to be the other way round. But in my opinion, if I had two mothers, as an example, I would not feel comfortable telling them some things. Many people need someone of the same gender to relate to in some situations. Now like I said, I am completely pro-adoption. And I made this thread to see differing views or mutual views, so cool. But damn it don't take this so seriously. At the end of the day I support gay adoption and think it is right and as normal as heterosexual adoption. I simply think heterosexual adoption has its advantages.",

It wasn't till I got my first computer with Internet access that I learned how profound both my atheism and bisexuality really are. Until then, I cannot describe the feelings of loneliness I got from both feelings. So yes, I think in many cases, though not all, coming out as atheist and coming out as gsm are very similar. With respect to gsm, there are multiple lgbt senators, actors, and other role models. With respect to atheism, I think I can count famous atheists that are alive today on one hand. \n\nQuite frankly I find it rather pathetic that you even found this necessary. You are squandering the good will of many over silly words or phrases. I know they can be offensive or incorrectly used quite often. With the case of \"faggot\" no self-respecting atheist who intends anything similar to good will towards the lgbt community would use it in a deragatory way, just like I dont mean illwill towards African-Americans when I use the word \"nigger\" when quoting music lyrics for example. As for coming out, often the intent is more of an empathy then some sort of pissing contest like you make it out to be. \n\nQuite simply, you are the one who gives these words or phrases power wether you take them in context or not. Do you get upset if a Jewish guy (presuming you are not Jewish) sincerely wishes you \"Happy Hanuka!\"? If so, I suggest you simply walk around with your fingers in your ears singing \"lalalalalala\" because 90% of what you hear from people, intended as an insult or not, will be pissing you off.",

It's not a big deal.\n\n> Never, ever compare your coming outs to our coming outs.\n\nFrankly, this strikes me as \"we're more oppressed than you are, shut up!\" I don't think this is productive or useful. Yes, overall, LGBT people have it a lot worse, and coming out as such, depending on your location, can be really, really difficult and traumatic. However, this does not change the fact that in some places it is also difficult to \"come out\" as an atheist. In some places it will get you jailed or killed.\n\nIs it as bad, or even comparable? Probably not. Getting upset over this because you somehow \"own\" the issue of \"coming out\" is not really going to achieve anything useful.\n\nI've noticed some reluctance to using the language of \"coming out\" in the context of non-belief, which I think is understandable. Personally I try not to make the comparison because I am not comfortable with it. On the other hand, some LGBT atheists do think it's ok. (Greta Christina wrote some really good stuff on this topic a while back, might be worth searching for.) Ultimately though I don't think this is a very important or productive topic.\n\n> Put your money where your mouth is. If you really support LGBT equality, you should be able to get through at least, like, one Zinnia Jones video without filling the comments with \"WHAT IS THAT?\" and \"WTF IS WITH THAT VOICE?\"\n\nHeh I don't even know what this means. :)\n\nAs far as putting my money where my mouth is, I am very vocal in my support for LGBT people and their rights, and very upfront with that, even on \"real name\" sites like facebook. Granted, that's relatively easy for me given that it's the generally accepted view where I live, but I'm not about to move to the bible belt.",

I don't care if someone jokingly calls me a faggot. Context and intent are more important than a silly word, and I can find things people say which don't include the word far more offensive than times when I've heard someone use the word as a joke. Obviously I avoid using the word except in a demonstrative context in a place like this subreddit, because there are people who do find it offensive, and I can respect that. But it's a bit disingenuous to make it look like every person under the lgbt spectrum gasps for air in offence when they hear that word. Similarly, I really, really doubt there are many atheists who would be sincerely offended at being called a \"Hellbound devil worshipper\" in an ironic context.\n\nSecondly, as someone who is both gay and an atheist (well, pantheist, technically), from a Catholic background, there are parallels. Direct comparisons are obviously inaccurate but telling people they shouldn't compare them at all stinks incredibly like ethnic minorities telling the LGBT movement not to compare their experiences with their own. It is far more alienating of potential allies than it needs to be. Take what you said here\n> \"It's about refraining from saying \"we have it just as bad as the gays\" or \"our experiences parallel the gays in a lot of ways\" without having any idea what it's like to be LGBT.\"\n\nand replace gay/LGBT with black.

Sounds like a joke I might use to greet a fellow atheist, like w the baby-eaters meme... \n\npoint 2 has been beaten to death in the other comments, but just to the add to general disagreements, I recognize absolutely nothing in your description about coming out gay; I never did find my gayness itself confusing or terrorizing, nor had some particular anxiety about being different from my staight family or friends. \n\nAnd just to note, coming out atheist was pretty simple for me in comparison to coming out gay - though I did hide it for a short while. Disbelief is not common here, but I haven't noticed hateful prejudices or active discrimination against atheists yet, while homophobia is rampant. Post communist heritage I guess...\n\nBut still, the only thing that bothered and bothers me about my sexual orientation or could bother me about atheism is - how ppl, esp ppl w some power over me, will react to finding out. \n\nSo it does seem more similar than different to me...\n\nBut in any case, while your post is otherwise on target, I think you're mostly demonstrating the consequences of abysmal quality of many submissions over at r/atheism.\n\nOn the other hand, what I'm seeing in this thread seems fairly worse to me - things like this getting 50 votes:\n\n> They've painted our struggle for civil rights not as a fight against bigotry but as a war of Queers vs. Christians, where one has to die for the other to survive. \n\nwell, as a gay atheist, I find this massively offensive (:P), coming from a place like r/lgbt which I though of as a supportive group. \n\nI consider atheists a discriminated religious minority, and our fight for equal rights (ie a secular state and societal tolerance where these aren't won - which would prob be almost everywhere on the planet), even if you happen to believe stuff we don't, should be something a person I care to even communicate with would support (just like I wouldn't care to even talk to a homophobe). \n\nYet here, atheists apparently wish Christians dead? WTF? Perhaps the intended meaning is - hope they'd change their mind, (though this is dubious - most prob. simply stop at hoping they'd stop imposing their opinions), but goodness is there a more aggressive language to describe what is a mere discussion?\n\nFurthermore, this planet doesn't end on the borders of the USA, and whatever the tactical situation might be there, I think I can safely guarantee you one thing - **the extent to which gays will be accepted in my bigoted little country is and will remain directly correlated to the lack of affiliation to institutionalized religions here. And its influence on the state, now quite extensive. Which is to say - exactly the fights atheists most directly care about.**\n\nPerhaps there are gay friendly religious denominations in the USA; there isn't and prob won't be any here. Beyond simply believing whatever, each in their own particular way ofc.\n\nBecause the catholic church here is quite a different beast from what I gather it is in the USA. And the country will hardly suddenly become mainline protestant or something. Yet the disinterest to what the church might want or think is pervasive enough for an openly agnostic guy to be directly elected president (fairly powerless post though) \n\n------\nso, before criticizing an admittedly low-quality subreddit for attempting to offer support, how about first clearing up the bigoted attitudes towards the plights of others here?\n\nI'll consider whether to continue following this disappointing subreddit at all.",

This is harsh on both sides. Both sides are bullied, ridiculed and spat on. We both have to fight to be accepted and loved for who we are. Yeah, so they atheists can get married legally but they will still be rejected by most preachers/pastors if their beliefs are public knowledge. It is a low comparison because the LGBT group needs to fight for their marriage at all but if you start making that case you become part of the masses saying \"but we have it worse.\" \n\nAtheists are trying to fight for science to not be overthrown or contaminated by religion and the LGBT group is fighting to make love legal.\n\nI am all for telling them what hurts us and how they can better support us but I also think we should show them that same support.

There **are** many parallels between growing up gay and growing up atheist in religious environments, and I'm very inclined to disagree when you state that the only similarity is the use of the term \"coming out\" to refer to being more open about your beliefs/sexuality.  \n  \nThe last thing you should be doing if you want acceptance is telling the people who are trying to sympathize with you that \"the terror that you're growing completely differently from your straight, cis family is completely different from living as an adolescent or adult with the knowledge that there are no gods.\" In fact that statement is very flawed in itself. You're separating yourself and making yourself different. And yeah, I guess you are different, but you don't need to start talking down to people who are trying to sympathize with you because there is apparently nothing worse or equal to the pain of growing up gay.  \n  \nI don't even really agree with how /r/atheism acts, but I am heterosexual and I am atheist, although I'm a supporter of equality among whatever sexuality, religion, gender, or anything that you choose to associate yourself with. According to your logic though, I shouldn't be trying to reach out to you or anything because my experiences are incomparable.  \n  \n**TL;DR: Separating yourself by claiming that your suffering is special isn't going to help you gain societal acceptance.**",

The person who made it and the people who voted it up were not attacking any LGBTQ people. They weren't even using the term 'fag' in their own, original text. They were using the phrase to make a point. If you made a similar philosorapter about atheists, to be quite honest, most of the people on r/atheism would probably find it humorous. Using a term for satire or to make a point is different than using it as an insult. If you can't handle the former then the problem is with you.\n\nOn your second point...really? Yes, a cisgender, heterosexual atheist does not know what an LGBTQ individual goes through when coming out. However, the same applies for a religious LGBTQ individual in reference to atheism. As someone who has to deal with both I can assure you that, while the feelings of gender dysphoria are generally not there, the feelings of sexual frustration and societal pressure are most definitely present. Your point is hypocritical and shows no respect for the people you are sending this note to.\n\nAnd, finally, your third point. The only truly valid one in the bunch. Though most atheists I know personally have a strong respect for LGBTQ individuals, I am aware that many do hold very shallow views on the subject. However, r/atheism and the atheist community in general has been working on fixing that fact. From very abrasive atheist personalities like TJ Kincaid (The Amazing Atheist) to the more contained like Greta Christina, most popular atheist have come out in favor of the LGBTQ community and actively support it. Browse r/atheism for a while and you will see this fact in abundance.\n\nPlease, think through your points more thoroughly next time before making a post addressing a group of nearly 900,000 people.",

I would have a different opinion though if the author were referring to religion in general.\n\nNumber 2 is painfully reminiscent of many anti-gay black people complaining that we're abusing the black civil rights movement by comparing some of our struggles with theirs. It should be obvious to any thinking person that they are not exactly the same fight, but valid parallels *can* be made. Personally, I had a much easier time coming out as an atheist than as gay, but that's just because I live in secular Canada, where even many of the homophobes are either non-religious or apathetic about it. Far too many atheists, especially in the Bible Belt, get shunned and disowned by their own families/friends. It is trivial and insensitive for the gay community to criticize them when some of their experiences very clearly resemble ours.\n\nI am in complete agreement with number 3.",

People, including family, might bully you about it.\n\nThese things could literally be said about Wiccans, Scientologists, people with Herpes, people who practice BDSM, and people who are multiracial.  There is no special defining similarity between LGBT people and atheists, and I'm saying this as both.  The only thing that seems to have given /r/atheism the impression that the two are similar is Dawkins' and others' insistence that they \"come out\" to increase visibility.  If he'd used literally any other phrase, I doubt the comparison ever would have come up.  The idea that they're at all similar seems to be a result of a terrible cognitive flaw.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that they should change what they call it, or that they can't have terrible experiences.  I've been chastised for being atheist by religious gay people and chastised for being gay by atheist straight people.  Depending on where I am and who I'm around, either could be worse than the other, but they're *always* a different set of realities.  \n\nFor example, when I go to the restaurant with my girlfriend, we're sure not getting stared at cause we're atheist!  Nobody asks us for a threesome or if they could watch because they love atheists.  Nobody ever got told they couldn't get married cause atheist.  There are currently 0 states voting on atheist marriage.  My girlfriend (Zinnia Jones) is trans.  Nobody ever comments on the way her voice sounds because she's atheist.  Nobody says \"it's a trap\" when they find out she's atheist.  The differences are far more significant than the similarities.\n\n",

I imagine many of us have experienced the same kind of treatment or have at least lived in fear of it.  \n\nI appeal to you to drop this point as it pours gas on the proverbial bridge that is perfectly functional, and if anything, needs just a little routine maintenance, not threat of burning.\n\nThis is not some sort of contest.  BOTH our groups know what it's like to experience rejection.  Our rejection isn't necessarily worse than theirs nor is theirs worse than ours.  They are different, yet intrinsically linked in ways that should promote EMPATHY, not what seems a little like self-righteous indignation.\n\n3.)  I'm with you on your points regarding Zinnia.  That being said, let me bracket that statement with this thought: I realize that non-hetero-normative expressions of gender and sexuality are a progressive and emerging aspects of mainstream social experience.  Ignorance toward these expressions should be, in my opinion, approached with compassion and patient instruction, even and ESPECIALLY in the light of violent rejection of that instruction.\n\nAs a (I like to think) progressive Christo-Deist, I completely understand how abrasive the continual beating of the dead horses that goes on in r/atheism can get, but these folks truly are our allies, and as such, deserve a RESPECTFUL and DIPLOMATIC request to re-evaluate the methods by which they support us.  Again, I re-emphasize my first statement here when I say that I strongly oppose the overall tone of this initial open letter and request that it be indexed in a less inflammatory tone.",

Over time, however, it became more and more difficult because some of the women I worked with would go on long rants about how I had no way of comprehending how bad they had it, and whenever I tried to find common grounds or explain that I have been followed and mugged before, they would scream at me for being misogynistic and not having a clue of how it felt to be vulnerable.\n\nAs I read your post, I came up with rational, logical reasons why I don't think your points are valid, and came up with some good explanations as to why they aren't.  But by the time I got to the end of it, I realized that if this was going to be another round of \"our suffering is greater than your suffering\", that I have nothing to say on that topic that could help bridge the gap, because your mind is already made up.\n\nI will continue to do what I can to advance equality for everyone IRL, but this post made me upset enough that I am unsubscribing from r/lgbt for a time to focus on people who don't want to make their hardships into a competition.  I'm sorry if this posts offends anyone.\n\nEdit: I see all your posts trying to say it's not about who has it worse, but I'm going to say that's not true.  If it's not about who has it worse, you should have zero problem with building bridges and making the comparison, because in reality the struggle IS quite similar. ",

I think the stories can be very similar. If you have close immediate family that are hyper religious and you are risking being beaten or kicked out of the house because you disagree with your parent's beliefs, then there are strong similarities to the intolerances that gay people face. It is more important to recognize the common bonds we share than the differences. \n\nThe only thing that I'd suggest that /r/atheism needs to recognize is that not all LGBT people are atheists.\n\n\n\n",

There are plenty of religious people who support LGBT rights.\n\nOne would think that since the principal argument against LGBT-ers is religious, that atheists would be more welcoming.

That is not to make those issues seem less important by any means! It's just that, minorities and women were easier to spot. LGBT-ers have the audacity to look and act **just like normal people** while at once containing a perversion that we could/would inflict on the poor, unsuspecting populous.\n\nI think we need a lot of support, but I think that solely attaching ourselves to r/atheism would be loudly proclaiming that this is a religious issue. And while it is to some degree, it's mostly that people find us \"gross\".\n\nIf more and more people are telling polls that they are less believing, then why are more and more people using religion as a defense against LGBT rights? It's because they want to be PC - in a manner of speaking - and not come out and say it: They think we're disgusting and subhuman.\n\nSorry, I'm ranting.

Just like a straight, cis person has no idea what it's like to be LGBT, a religious LGBT person in a religious community has no idea what it's like to be atheist in a religious community. The experiences *are* similar. That said, I don't agree with statements like \"we have it just as bad as the gays\" for exactly the reason you give: in general, atheists *don't* know how bad it is for gays. But that doesn't mean that their situation isn't simliar (it's just not **the same**).  Besides, what's the difference between being ridiculed, beaten up, or removed from your family for being gay and being ridiculed, beaten up, or removed from your family for being atheist? The result is the same. It's still traumatizing.\n\nI respectfully disagree that this is something that is \"a good project to improve reddit and our cause.\" In fact, I think it is actually something that could *negatively* impact \"our cause.\" None of these are serious, community-wide issues.

While they may not hold beliefs as strong as the extremists and may be easier to convert, they should be praised for their open-mindedness at the very least.

And that reason is what has become known as \"the armor of God.\" It's a common refrain around reddit that if there wasn't religion homophobes would just find other reasons to hate on gay people and so it's a non-issue. Like most reddit platitudes, it has a grain of truth in it, but it's utter nonsense at bottom.\n\nWhile it's undeniably true that there are non-religious arguments against gay marriage there remains a unique insidiousness when it comes to the religious ones. You can argue that homosexuality is \"against\" evolution or biology all you like, actually researching the subject explodes that argument easy as pie. The problem with the religious arguments against homosexuality is that there neutral arbiter of empiricism isn't there. You can have your interpretation of the Bible and I can have mine, but there's no way to settle our disputes once and for all. An uncomfortable truth about theology is that there's no way to really *prove* that Shelby Spong is more right than Pat Robertson is more right than Fred Phelps.\n\nWhat cutting religion out of the equation does is force everyone onto the same playing field. All of a sudden a person's subjective experience of spirituality doesn't carry weight. All of a sudden we're all beholden to the harsh mistress that is empirical evidence. I understand it hurts people's feelings, but the time has long past to dispense with this kind of distraction, especially when it comes to civil rights issues.\n\nIncidentally, this is a major reason why anti-gay rhetoric works at the ballot box and takes a nosedive in court.

Th. 9.7.3) was issued in 342 AD by the Christian emperors Constantius II and Constans, which prohibited same-sex marriage in ancient Rome and ordered that those who were so married were to be executed.\n\nAlso, I find it hard to separate religion from the people in charge of it, since religion is basically created by those people, it's not something pure and friendly that spiritual leaders corrupted. The Popes and the theologians shaped Christianity throughout history, starting from the very first centuries after Christ (the [council of Nicaea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea) in 325 AD comes to my mind).\n\nSo the different interpretations given to different parts of the Bible ARE the Christian religion.

Let me leave you with this great quote by Kant, written in 1784, (full text [here](http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/CCREAD/etscc/kant.html), boldface is mine)\n\n>What Is Enlightenment? Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed nonage. Nonage is the inability to use one's own understanding without another's guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one's own mind without another's guidance. Dare to know! (*Sapere aude.*) \"**Have the courage to use your own understanding**,\" is therefore the motto of the enlightenment.\n\n>Laziness and cowardice are the reasons why such a large part of mankind gladly remain minors all their lives, long after nature has freed them from external guidance. [...] **It is so comfortable to be a minor.** If I have a book that thinks for me, a pastor who acts as my conscience, a physician who prescribes my diet, and so on--then I have no need to exert myself.\n\n>[...]   \n\n>Dogmas and formulas, these mechanical tools designed for reasonable use--or rather abuse--of his natural gifts, are the fetters of an everlasting nonage.",

The fact that r/atheism is supporting us in the first places shows their good intentions. All you're doing is showing us to be ungrateful, and ostracising them.

It's similar (but obviously not the same) to when Mark Twain used racial slurs in Huckleberry Finn, it's to make a point that those words are not okay to use and pretty ridiculous.

Sure I don't like it either when people use offensive language in an offensive way. I get just as angry as all of you when I see the signs saying 'god hates fags'. But censorship is the root of making words offensive. Words are just that, words, and their meanings changed. My dad says 'fag' because he doesn't think it's offensive. But doesn't like 'gay' because when he was growing up THAT was the offensive word.  Words don't mean anything, it's what the person saying them means by it. If the person doesn't mean it offensively and means it in a satirical manner in mimicry of Westboro Baptist then don't get offended.

I have spoken up for the gay community here, on r/Atheism and probably several other subreddits over the past few years. \n\nI have encountered people on r/Atheism i can't agree with (especially those expressing hatred for the Muslim Faith simply because i can't tell the difference between them and \"Christians\" spouting the same hatred), but i have apparently missed much of what you have encountered. I have, however, Argued for the continued support of gay rights by Atheists even though someone felt a need to question why r/atheism even talks about the subject of Gay Rights.\n\nHuman Rights are Human Rights and the very fact that those opposed to Gay Rights use religion as the basis of their argument is exactly why every Atheist should stand shoulder to shoulder with the Gay Community.\n\nBut even more so, every human being should be on your side fighting for your rights. I don't want to live in a world where there is no one to stand up for my rights and i refuse to ignore the bullshit and prejudice other people have to go through.\n\nYou have my full support and you always will.",

That being said:  I've seen people lose their careers due to their sexuality.

There were a few atheists who called me a faggot just as there were a few Christians who said I would burn in Hell. I guess my point is one of coming together as a society instead of picking alliances against other factions in that society.

        "body": "In spite of my reputation, I do usually like to give people who would like to show the LGBT community support the benefit of the doubt, so I'm going to assume that /r/atheism does actually want to be fully and properly supportive of the LGBT community and that they're simply unaware of how some of the things they post, comment, and upvote are actually quite hurtful to us.  Rather than fill more posts with furious comments, I've decided to go out of character for once and make a helpful list of suggestions.  I thought that /r/lgbt might like to help me with this project.  Here are some things I've got for a starting off point:\n\n1. Unless you are gay, don't assume you know how to use the word fag/faggot without being completely offensive.  [This one is near the top of /r/atheism today](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/vdb6q/something_that_i_had_been_wondering_for_a_while/).  I know you're paraphrasing the Westboro Baptist Church, but how silly would it be if we decided to support atheism by saying \"why hate all the hellbound devil-worshippers?\"  Not cool, right?  Well, Westboro Baptist Church is using that word because it's so hateful and so offensive to gay people and because it's been used by people who have wanted to beat and kill gay people for a very long time.  In your support of us, do not use the same foul pejoratives we've had flung at us by bullies all our lives.  \n\n2. Never, ever compare your coming outs to our coming outs.  The words you're using to describe it are where the similarities end.  Living as an adolescent with knowledge of your attraction to the same sex or gender dysphoria, the terror that you're growing completely differently from your straight, cis family is completely different from living as an adolescent or adult with the knowledge that there are no gods. When you compare the two things as though there are no differences, or the differences are small, you are demonstrating that you have no understanding of LGBT experiences and no desire to acquire one.\n**edit: I'm not saying this because I think they shouldn't use the words \"coming out.\"  I'm saying that the words \"coming out\" are where the similarities end.  Yes, even if they got ridiculed or beat up or taken out of their families.  It's not about who has it better or worse.  It's about respecting the fact that as a straight, cis person you don't know what it is like to be LGBT.  It's about refraining from saying \"we have it just as bad as the gays\" or \"our experiences parallel the gays in a lot of ways\" without having any idea what it's like to be LGBT.**\n\n3. Put your money where your mouth is.  If you really support LGBT equality, you should be able to get through at least, like, one Zinnia Jones video without filling the comments with \"WHAT IS THAT?\" and \"WTF IS WITH THAT VOICE?\"  \n\n[example 1 lone comment \"surprised the shit out of me that the speaker was female\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/onel7/jesus_was_more_like_me_than_you_is_a_pointless/)   [example 2 featuring \"I'm not gay but I'd totally spoon with him/her\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/oujkm/so_you_hate_religion_but_you_worship_god_and_go/)   [example 3 featuring \"Some of his videos are spot on but... I'm subscribed to his channel is because of the 'shock value', not because I want to hear her rabble about the most arbitrary matters.\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/qfjs3/my_face_of_atheism_on_jesus/)   [example 4  \"DUDE, THAT'S A DUDE??? Fuck! Up to today, I thought she just spoke funny. And yes, I thought she was hot. Fuck.\n\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/d05qr/am_i_the_only_straight_guy_who_find_zinnia_jones/)\n\nIn fact, start with this one.  Start actually treating us like people before you start acting like you're our champions.\n\n\nOkay, r/lgbt.  Add your anger/tips/whatever and if/when we gather enough material, we'll x-post over in r/atheism.  I think this is a good project to improve reddit and our cause.  ",

Nobody in their right mind tries to believe in something or not to believe in it, what you should do is try and find the truth.\n\nI don't think you can directly choose your beliefs (you do have much more influence on it than sexuality though), but it is different than sexuality. It seems obvious to me that you should believe what is true based on the best available reason and evidence, whereas sexuality is derived simply from biology.",

I am not going to try to counter this giant mother of a wall, but hopefully give you some insight on why it is easy for a (more radical) Christian to use the \"Hate the sin not the sinner\" concept, and why another (modern) Christian can look past it. \n\n* Christianity is about loving God, and salvation of the soul. This universe is huge. It is wonderful. Everything happened at the right time to produce magnificent beauty. Christians credit this miraculous miracle to God. \n\n* God then gave the world. He created an eco system, animals, humans. Everything in perfect harmony to sustain an entire planet and system.\n\n* God then gave us the most precious gift - a soul! A wonderful soul that is us! \n\n* The Christian churches first purpose is **salvation of the soul**. It is to protect our most precious thing. Our link between this world and God. It does this by instilling positive moral values in people all over the world. Countless charities, goods, and services. (Believe it or not, the church is one of the biggest donators on this planet, in both goods, and literal services [yes, despite the big gold throne]). The wonderful church inspired marvelous people - Mother Theresa, Pope John Paul II, and many more. These people have done so much good for mankind, and they credit it to the Church and to God. \n\n* Now there is sexuality. Some people like the same sex? The current church is an old dog, and new tricks do not come easy. Sexuality, **on the grand scale of things, is insignificant**. Sexuality is nothing compared to helping others, or the status of your soul. People support this church because it does so much good for the world - they do not see sexuality *as a big deal*. That is why they continue to support the church, knowing that some of their views do not fit modern times. \n\n* This does not mean that they endorse a hate-filled institution. Simple acts - apologies, holding a poster, wearing a rainbow braclet - show that they believe in the LGBT cause. \n\n* Despite all of this, the church is moving in a modern direction. Just at a slower pace. Understandable, because this institution is almost 2000 years old, and run by people near that age. Nobody claims it to be perfect, but you cannot expect quick solutions to old problems. \n\n**Disclaimer** : This post is not meant to \"convert\" anybody, justify any actions of hate, or insult any group. The point here is to try to help people understand more about the Christian mindset for a calmer, and more productive discussion. ",

Remember that in the Catholic church, sex is meant for making kids, so if there is ZERO chance of making kids you shouldn't be having sex. It's slightly more nuanced than that, but there's the basic point.\n\nThis is absolutely correct.  But I guess if I've had sex with a girl on birth control, oral sex, or masturbated, that makes me a bad Catholic.\n\n>2) Regarding homosexual marriage: marriage in the Catholic church is defined as the union of a man and a woman for the purposes of makin behbehs, plain and simple, so obviously homosexual \"marriages\" are opposed. Note: Homoseual UNIONS on the other hand have no opposition in catholic doctrine.\n\nOf course homosexual marriages are opposed by the church, and as a religious organization, this is completely within their rights.  As far as homosexual unions go, it is frowned upon, and to think that any diocese would support such a union is absurd.\n\n>3) Regarding homosexual urges: these are a test from god, a temptation of the flesh, like wanting to bone your friend's wife. It is natural, yes but to be suppressed. Furthermore, someone with homosexual feelings should NOT be hated anymore than someone with a desire to steal, or murder.\n\nYes, it's completely rational to hate homosexuals on the same level (but no more, mind you) as thieves and murderers.\n\n>So you see, though the catholic DOCTRINE (ie. the actual written RULES of the church, fundamental beliefs) is not the most gay-friendly or sensitive, it is FAR from hateful. The DOGMA (ie. things that develop from individual biases of sects or individuals, common but not esential) of hatred for gays may be widespread, but does NOT reflect the core values of the Catholic church. A TRUE and PROPER catholic, though he/she may disapprove of homosexual sex and marriage, would NOT act hatefully toward them or condone such hatred. Stop saying that the church is inherently anti-gay because that's simply untrue. Certainly the church has done shitty things to gays, but so have most institutions to be quite honest.\n\nDoctrine influences dogma.  After 2000 years, it's safe to say that both terms can be used interchangeably.  By virtue of this, the dogma does reflect the core values of the Catholic church.  That doesn't mean that everyone who claims Catholicism as a religion believes all of the dogma, but as an institution it is inherently flawed.\n\n>Look at it this way, for much of history most European nations had laws forbidding gay sex, obviously a pretty hateful thing to do. Would you condemn citizens of the UK for supporting an institution (the british government) which was ONCE hateful towards gays? Of course not.\n\nI wouldn't condemn individual citizens.  There are plenty of things that the U.S. does that I disagree with, but I vote.  Governments, just like any other institution, only have power when its citizens are willing to allow a government to have such power.\n\n>Furthermore, why the huge focus on Christianity, hm? What about Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, shamanic faiths etc? Are these HATEful institutions too? No, you only bring up Christianity, because just like every other anti-theist you assume that YOUR individual experience with it characterizes not only the ENTIRE religion, but ALL religions.\n\nI focus on Christianity because the majority of reddit users reside in the United States and Europe, two geographic regions that are familiar with Christianity.  Also, many LGBT apologists come from Christian backgrounds.  Islam and Judaism, when you look at their core values, are just as bad, if not worse, than the Christian stance on homosexuality.  Buggery may have been illegal in the U.K. for a long time, but an Islamic country like Saudi Arabia still puts people to death who are found guilty of homosexual acts.  Buddhism is more of a philosophy than a religion per se; I have neither encountered nor heard of a Buddhist extremist, so it's really not pertinent to bring Buddhism into this argument.\n\n>I am not a Christian, and I'm certainly open to homosexual sex personally, but this sort of thing offends me as a human being. Being attacked by bigoted people does not excuse your own bigoted behaviour. You're attack an institution that you really don't know jack shit about. Do some research before you make such ridiculous and offensive claims.\n\nYou have every right to be offended.  But to accuse me of bigotry is ludicrous.  I don't hate Catholics, Muslims, Baptists, or Pagans.  What I find detestable are the hollow apologies from some churchgoers.  Some people are trying to make a change to these institutions from within, but the majority of them do not.  It's their way of removing personal guilt from themselves and placing it on the institutions they actively or passively support.  And this is supposed to make me feel better?  Furthermore, I do not understand how any self-respecting member of the LGBT community would vehemently defend a religion that promotes hateful sentiment.  The whole 'hate the sin, love the sinner' mentality is even more sickening, and people are so blinded by their faith they don't even see the hypocrisy in this.  I equate it to a black man trying to defend the actions of the Ku Klux Klan.  It just doesn't make any sense.\n\n\n",

The only problem is that, in Catholic doctrine, you are not permitted to have anything other than vanilla vaginal sex, a form of sex which, for obvious reasons, is not an option for gay couples.\n\nAnd that prohibition leads to advocacy against gay marriage. You know marriage, that thing people do to show a loving commitment to one another.\n\nExcept that the prohibition makes no sense on the ground you espoused (\"making babehs\", as you put it). And I KNOW there are a bunch of restrictions on couples (ex-Catholic here), I'm just not addressing them in this post because I don't have enough time to go into the inanity of Catholicism's fucked up view of sexuality (imagine, if you will, the guilt heaped upon a young boy growing up whenever he masturbates, know he's performing a \"mortal sin\" and is placing his soul in danger of hell. That's a sick teaching right there, but it's not the focus of my diatribe.)\n\nIt's also irrelevant because many, many gay relationships DO have sexual elements to them and are deeply loving. Catholic doctrine shits on them because of its own conceited views.\n\nYou're right that there's nowhere in Catholic doctrine to hate sinners. That's not the point of what I'm describing here. Do you think the Bishops in Minnesota actually hate gays? What about the Bishops in Nigeria? Or were they just defending morality *according to their own damn faith*?\n\n> I am not defending Catholics or Catholic administrators, only the faith of Catholicism\n\nYou should spend more time going the other way around, at least for lay Catholics. Lay Catholics are far, far more likely to approve of gay marriage compared to other mainstream Christian groups, *in direct defiance of their own articles of faith*.\n\n**EDIT**: looking up the idea of cohabiting, sexually abstinent gay couples. While there I can't find doctrine outright condemning such arrangements, [it seems there's no consensus either that it's permissable](http://forums.catholic.com/showthread.php?t=642006). As that thread states, the Church urges chastity with the help of *disinterested* friendship as assistance. Doing otherwise leads to two problems: it places the practitioners in an [occasion of sin](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11196a.htm) which the faithful are called to avoid, and it gives rise to [scandal](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13506d.htm), which is a sin in and of itself. This makes sense given the Church's position that [\"homosexual inclinations\" are, as it states, \"objectively disordered\"](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a6.htm#2358).\n\nSo I don't think you're justified in saying the doctrine of the Church allows for chaste gay couples either, at least not in any meaningful sense. From what I see, the only possible way it may be permitted is if the two gay men or women in question absolutely had no attraction for one another, either sexual or romantic: on such an occasion they would be similar to two straight men living together.",

If you actually read the websites you post, you'll understand that restrictions are placed on all couples, not to say that all or even most Catholic couples adhere to them. Furthermore, there is nowhere in the Catholic doctrine that advocates hatred for sinners. Everyone sins at some point, no one is clean.

The local Churches don't all constantly report back to the pope to ask how they should act.

The vast majority of people who support the church do not fear hell, if they did it would be evident in their behavior.

If you say otherwise, you are absolutely lying to yourself and have never been in a situation that called for this sort of judgment.\n\nSimilarly with Christians, the threat of eternal damnation in hell is very real, always looming overhead, and defying the church is the fastest way to get you there. Your sins don't really matter; they can all be forgiven. What matters is your relationship with Christ, which you can improve by supporting and attending church.\n\nHell may not seem like that big of a deal to you, but it is to Christians. Imagine that a place exists where you will be tortured for eternity if you defy the church. Does the threat of being tortured for eternity sound good to you? If that were something I believed in, I would probably try to avoid that too. Let me paraphrase this in all caps with bold and italics, since this is the point you're not getting. ***THE THREAT OF HELL IS VERY REAL TO CHRISTIANS AND DEFYING THE CHURCH IS NOT AN OPTION, EVEN IF IT MEANS SUPPORTING SOME VALUES THEY DON'T AGREE WITH***\n\nIf you really believe that these people alone are responsible for the power the church has over society (they're not), you should work at converting them away from Christianity, rather than condemning and blaming them outright.

If I did imply that, it was an error and I will gladly edit my post to clarify what I meant. Regardless, it should be clear now that it is not my position that supporters of the church are the worst people on earth.\n\n>In your other post, you say they're supporting bigots and rapists by supporting the church. REALLY??? That's such an enormous leap.\n\nIt is a central doctrine of the church that people deserve to burn in hell for having gay sex. The church is explicitly and unrepentant bigoted. The Catholic church is even worse than most churches because their policy for dealing with child rape by their priests is to keep it a secret and not tell the authorities. This isn't something that just happens, it is an actual policy, one which the current pope was involved in enforcing.\n\nThe organisation is bigoted and protects rapists, if you support the organisation, you are supporting bigotry and the protection of rapists, as well as directly supporting the rapists by paying their salaries. This is not an enormous leap, it is not a leap at all.\n\n>The church has plenty of legitimate purposes that appeal to your average every day person, who most likely is blissfully ignorant to much of the corruption and many of the on-goings in the higher levels of the church.\n\nCan you name one legitimate purpose that the catholic Church provides that could not be provided by another organisation?\n\nAnd I agree that some people are legitimately ignorant of what goes on, and I don't find much fault with those people. But the fact that the church is bigoted is extremely clear, so to remain blissfully ignorant, they must remain willfully ignorant. Anyone with any sense can see that there are issues that need to be investigated, and if they avoid that investigation they are taking responsibility for the consequences.\n\n>Because that's what they've been taught to do and they don't know any other way.\n\nBullshit. They know that there are other churches, they  know that there are churches that don't condemn homosexuals. Maybe a few are so insulated or so stupid that they don't realize there are other options, but I doubt there are many.\n\n>If you're a God fearing individual, forming a relationship with him is a necessity.\n\nThere are many churches, and if you feel that your particular need for a church is not met, you can start your own. You could start a church that preaches the exact same things as Catholicism, but remove the bigotry and refuse to do business with the corrupt Catholic church.\n\nThis is without mentioning the fact that nobody in the Catholic church actually forms a relationship with God.\n\n> Especially in Catholicism, where you burn in hell for eternity if you fail to do this. You may think that sounds silly, but there are many people who genuinely believe this.\n\nYou will also burn in hell for eating shellfish according to the Muslim religion, and according to Joponofu, a god I just made up, you will burn in hell for all eternity if you fail to cover your left eye and give me all of your money. The threat of hell is not justification for believing something or supporting an organisation. And I think you severely overestimate the number of people who seriously believe they will burn in hell. If they truly thought that, they would be in church all the time, at confession constantly. Hell, they would all be nuns or priests.\n\nAnd even if they have been convinced that they will burn for leaving the church, the counterargument is present and available. If you decide to avoid examining the consequences of your actions, then you decide to accept them whatever they are.\n\n> Leaving the church and no longer supporting it is not an option for them, no matter how much you want it to be.\n\nLeaving is always an option. Even in the face of eternal damnation, you can stand for what is right.\n\n>Ehh... not really.\n\nReally. If you believe that everything the pope says is morally right, your sense of morality is inadequate. If you believe that people deserve to be punished eternally for crimes with finite consequences, your sense of morality is inadequate.\n\n>I do feel some degree of pity for Christians, but to hold all people like this accountable for the actions of a few assholes is just insane.\n\nWell its a good thing I don't do that then. I am fine any Christian who either supports a moderate church, or does not support any church at all. I can also live with people who fight within a bigoted church to end the bad practices.\n\nThe thing I have a problem with is the people who support an immoral church even though they know it is immoral, or have enough information that they should suspect it is immoral, and refuse to investigate.",

Not all of them believe in homophobia and not all of them are in total agreeance with the values of their church. To condemn someone despite this is extremely immature and, quite frankly, it makes you, who I assume identify with the LGBT community, no better than the Christians who condemn us.\n\nEDIT:\n\n>Believing Christ is their lord and savior is just silly, it takes a bit more than that to be a bad person.\n\nYeah, according to you, it takes attending mass and putting 25 cents on a collection tray every Sunday to be a bad person. In addition to believing in Christ, of course. I don't think these people as examples of human beings could be anymore disgusting.

The general idea of Christianity is to be a good person and be loving and understanding, not \"cruel and unforgiving\". Generalizing groups of people never works because there are good people and bad people, and when your sample size is in the millions, you can't assume they're all one or the other.",

Others don't hold too much stock in the old testament.  Others still accept and welcome LGBT with open arms.  \nI know it's worse in USA (i'm aussie) but we have the same issues here, but telling them to jam their thanks and go start fights with their fellow believers is just odd...  It's like spitting in their faces when really they've overcome a big hurdle in their belief system to apologise and accept homosexuals.\n\nI for one am grateful for each and every time and it makes me smile, these are the people that want to be on our side, but you want to kick gay sand in their face?  That is being a bit of a dick (your words).. Maybe you should just calm down and accept people are slowly coming around - you can't expect a religion to admit they're wrong and accept homosexuality overnight - these things take time and it is happeneing.  Remember it wasn't so long ago homosexuals were bashed in the street for being who we are.\n\nTL;DR - Not all christians are the same, churches won't change overnight and apologising is a good thing..",

However, I will state and stand by it that, to me it seems, a lot of what ticks in communism *as it was/is practiced in those states* has a common thread with religion, at least if you go by Marx's writing. Marx's theory of history strikes me as having major parallels with Christian mythology of there being a \"fall from a state of grace\", so to speak, a grace which may be reobtained in the future via implementation of socialism (similar to Christian eschatology). The Marxian concept of \"false consciousnesses\" also has parallels with the concept of \"original sin\".",

They're the same people who like to show up and say *\"I'm straight but I totally support gay rights!\"*\n\nThese type of posts are blunt, slightly ham-fisted first steps into a larger world. It takes time to learn to be an effective and eloquent ally. And a good number of those awkward kids are probably actually gay themselves, but it will take time before they can really deal with that.\n\nThink of it as kind of like \"newly out syndrome,\" that period of time when some people who have just come out as gay are also rather awkward. It can get annoying, but it's a stage they have to go through. They'll learn to be out (as gay, or as a straight ally) gracefully with time and experience.",

Here are some thoughts I would like to share with you.\nIn my experience I have also been frustrated by religious thoughts because it can operate so fully outside the reason that I like to have access too. Religions like Christianity can seem really silly when you don't understand them too much. And then you can be like, \"what the fuck are you serious?\" I mean I grew up in a Christian society and these Christian ideas seem not super bizarre to me, even if I'm not sure where I stand on all of it. But something like Islam, I never could get it, it was just so bizarre and nonsensical to me, until I sat down with some Muslim friends of mine, and they told me the story and the reasons for their belief. I appreciated it and learned very much from talking with them.\n\nI can look at your words, and I can easily replace certain words with queerphobic words, and I would not know what the difference is. Yes, I'm not straight, but the point for me is not that I am not straight and now I'm fighting against the oppressors, but that we look back and appreciate our humanity and not have a back and forth of rage.\n\nAnger, rage, and indignation can get a bad rap sometimes, as if these emotions ought to be restrained. However your feelings are your feelings and indignation anger or rage can be inspirational and transformative, so I do not want to say don't be angry, in fact please experience it fully. To me the point is not whatever belief system you hold but how we can work together on not being dicks to each other.\n\nI also think that for every moderate Christian doing this, it is not like it is the same moderate Christian reposting it over and over again, it is a different individual coming to say it personally each time, and I'm grateful for every one of them. \n\nSometimes I use words like insane and crazy. But sometimes I have also been called insane and crazy. One of the most marginalized groups in the world are those people struggling with mental illness, and I myself have been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons and the stigma of words like insane, crazy, and batshit really hurt. Historically diagnoses of madness were given to people who did not follow social norms or acted non normatively. Calling people with different views than you crazy or insane, is sort of a way of policing various mindsets and thought patterns, much like how gay slurs can police sexuality and gender norms. \n\n",

But unfortunately that's neither unique to religious communities and LGBTQ rights, or an uncommon response to observing injustice.\n\nLots of people complain about the US's various wars here on Reddit, but how many of us are actively causing problems for our government in any meaningful way? We passively support our government and go about our lives, our \"activism\" is just meaningless complaint. We express opposition to racism and inequality, but very few actually do anything to damage the system that keeps it in place. We passively support that system by living in it and (if we're white) benefiting from it. We object to the banks looting our country, but how many of us have actually withdrawn our money from them? We object to unjust laws, but how many actually risk arrest to fight them? We complain about our government, but almost all of us are going to continue to passively support it rather than actually emigrate to another country.\n\nMost of the ham-fisted *\"I'm Christian but I totally support you guys!\"* posts are probably from people who are isolated, young, and awkward. They're clueless, and not in a position to start a crusade against the community they live in. That's advanced activism - they're beginners. They probably don't even have much direct contact with people they know are LGBTQ. Most will improve at least a bit. Some will become the advanced activists, but they need time and experience first.\n\nIt's actually quite a remarkable change that's happening in fundamentalist communities - even among the most isolated and devout, young people aren't really comfortable with overt homophobia anymore. They express that discomfort awkwardly and half-heartedly, but it's amazing that they express it at all. They realize it's wrong, they're embaressed to be associated with it.

I could be married as a man, to a man, at the Virginian church I grew up at, by the priest who baptized me. My church will recognize the legitimacy and value of both my marriage and my identity as a man even when the state won't. My church has been one of my strongest allies in fighting for recognition from my state.\n\nI could marry a man and then be ordained and serve as a priest, and neither being gay nor trans are impediments to this. Hell, the Episcopal chaplain at Harvard is a trans man. He accompanied the Bishop of Massachusetts and 135 other clergy when they appealed to the MA state legislature to save the trans anti-discrimination bill last year.\n\nI'm not \"apologizing\" for a fucking thing. Yes the Episcopal church has its historical faults, like any organization that has existed for more than 50 years, but it has done a damn good job of recognizing its faults and correcting them. \n\nOur enemies *are theocrats.* They insert themselves into public political debate *because they want to use the law to impose their doctrine on everybody.* They are loud and beligerent and very, very visible.\n\nOur allies are *not* theocrats. They respect and defend the secular government that protects us all, and avoid direct political involvement. You won't see a progressive Episcopalian or Lutheran or United Church of Christ politician thumping a Bible from the podium, *because that would be inappropriate.* The work of progressive Christians, their advocacy and theology and dedication to human dignity and rights, stays on the level of denomination and academia and community. And then other progressives, like yourself, *actively work to ignore us while treating the theocrats as if they're the mouthpiece of Christianity.*\n\nSo what exactly are we fucking supposed to do here?

Sure, there are subtle differences between Catholics, Protestants, and the Eastern Orthodox sect.  But it's all based on the same book.  Every time you walk into a church you are giving credence to an archaic value system that really has no place in modern society.\n\nYes, I'm being a dick.  But someone needed to call this out.  You may not be assaulting gay men in the street or blowing up abortion clinics, but you're supporting a belief system that allows this kind of behavior to take place and simultaneously condemning these actions justified by God or scripture.  So next time, don't apologize.  Call the church out on its bullshit.  The problem with the so-called moderates is that they rarely ever speak up.  This is exactly why Rick Santorum is a serious contender for president of a developed nation.\n\nTL;DR: Everyone knows the evangelicals are bat shit insane, but religious moderates do further damage (and not just to LGBT people) without even realizing it.\n\n**EDIT:** Whoa!  I was not expecting all of these responses.  I don't agree with everyone, but thank you for keeping the discussion going and giving me a different perspective on this matter.",

Not only that, I've *never* in my entire existence heard that phrase. I've heard \"gyped,\" but that's because historically, gypsies who were not in their native country were harlems and thieves. The rooting for the term is much farther into history than \"jewed,\" which I can only assume was very late into history itself (feel free to correct me if you know the origin of this context).\n\nI've never heard \"Stop being so black\" or other variations either. \"Black\" has a meaning that goes farther back than you can imagine and has been associated with many different things on many different levels. Black can refer to dark magic, evil, satan-worship, darkness, etc. etc. etc.. The list goes on and on and on. It doesn't relate to black-skinned individuals. In fact, the slang term for black people is \"negro,\" and it's not even offensive. Gooooo figure. We could get into other slang terms, like nigger/ comparisons to monkeys, but those are intentionally insulting and again they are very deep rooted. I disagree with their use since the inception of the word in that context, or the comparison in question was *designed* to insult people.\n\nNot only that, I didn't dictate anyone's feelings. I simply said I don't *care* how they feel. If you take offense, cool. Go right ahead and tell me. I'll probably apologize and then continue right the fuck on like a civilized individual. You're young and you stand up for your rights as an equal, you feel as though you need to be pampered, cool. That's fantastic. If you want English speakers to stop saying \"gay,\" you bet the gay community has to stop calling heterosexuals \"straighties,\" \"breeders,\" \"carriers,\" etc. etc. etc.\n\nYou know what's really strange? Instead of asking for validation for my reasoning, or pming me, or holding a civilized discussion, you twisted my words and brought up new arguments when you realized the previous ones were failing. This is tactless and attempting to shift the attention to my argument without providing substance for your own is a terrible method of persuasion.\n\nI'd be happy to discuss this with you in greater detail if you pre-plan your argument and bring to me an engaging post.

The mass stupidity over the words gay & fag however, is not an example of anything more than a retarded society (I mean that literally) that can't be bothered to learn either the history/meaning of the words they're saying, nor any more fitting adjective to use in place of them.\n\nJust to educate here, so that we're all clear on this: the word fag is used to describe homosexuals because back when Americans were burning witches at the stake, they burned gay people too. Only it was thought that the stake was too good for them so they were just left at the bottom with all the kindling - the faggots. That's where that word comes from. That's what that means when you're using it to describe someone - that they are to be tied up and burned to death at the bottom of the pile while people watch and cheer. How lovely.\n\nNow you may use these words simply because your friends do, but when someone identifies with them and they have power in a person's mind, hearing someone using them in a negative way may cause them to feel hurt. They don't choose to feel that way (who would?) but the solution is not aggression against them for feeling hurt. You may actually have to change this one undesirable facet of your personality in order to fix the problem.\n\n...

        "body": "[This image](http://i.imgur.com/EX5v4.jpg) posted in /r/atheism got me thinking about the \"don't say gay/don't say fag\" debate that rages in these parts. It succinctly expresses an idea that I've had for a while but was never able to put into words. Here's a transcript:\n\n\"It's now very common to hear people say \"I'm rather offended by that\" as if that gives them them certain rights. It's actually nothing more... It's simply a whine. It's no more than a whine. \"I find that offensive,\" it has no meaning, it has no purpose, it has no reason to be respected as a phrase. \"I am offended by that,\" well so fucking what?!\"\n\nIt's up to the individual whether or not something offends them. Sometimes it's *hard* not to get offended and it might sound harsh to say this, but that's their problem and nobody else's. Taking offense accomplishes nothing. Instead, grow a pair of gonads and brush it off. It's far better to take a breath and let it go than allow someone to manipulate your emotions.\n\nIt makes even less sense to get offended *when the person speaking doesn't even have homosexuality in mind*. Again, if someone decides to find a meaning in words that wasn't there, then gets offended by that meaning, that's completely on them.\n\nAs for instances where offense *is* intended, where some arsehole is verbally abusing someone for their percieved sexual orientation, that arsehole can fuck right off. But once more, taking offense doesn't help. For one, that's exactly what this arsehole wants. Don't play into their hands. Don't give them the satisfaction. For two, words like gay or fag are just words. Words used by bigots to express their bigotted attitudes. Even if you stop them using those words, their attitude remains unchanged. And for as long as that attitude prevails, we still have a problem. Regardless of what words are being used to express it.",

The reason it's unethical is because a demand is being made towards people, an expectation that they change, without a compelling reason why they should do so. It amounts to nothing but an unjustifiable imposition upon them. \"Not imposing a normalization scheme\" is, obviously, *not* imposing anything of the sort upon them. That's what makes it ethical. It's imposing something upon people for no reason, versus not imposing it upon them. The answer to why the latter is more acceptable is implicit in my original post.",

Sure, have pride parades, but make sure to include all the non-flamboyant, non-promiscuous gays, who I trust still make up the majority.

This is a genetic characteristic you can also find manifested is such features as being able to pick out dangerous looking things in a group and \"gaydar.\" (Not drawing a comparison there). It is a feature that all top-level animal predators share. Most people are heterosexual for a number of reasons pertaining to nature and nurture, and try as they may to remember that some people happen to like to have sex with members of the same sex exclusively (or at least, occasionally), some cultural features of the \"homosexual\" crowds that are typical of the bell-curve distribution of features common to those groups tend to stick out in the otherwise largely \"heterosexual\" culture that is prevalent, and heterosexual people take notice of these things being queer. Also, memories fade, while genetics do not.\n\nI put homosexual and heterosexual is quotations, because clearly all people who enjoy physical stimulation CAN enjoy that stimulation regardless of the sex of a person (or object?) that is creating the stimulation, all other things being equal. Thus all physically capable people are capable of enjoying sexual activity with any other person capable of engaging is said self-same activity - however, this does not mean people always WANT TO, for various and sundry reasons.\n\nBesides that, it simply is a matter of what is most convenient/safe for a person in their situation, and you can't very well criticize a person for doing what is most convenient/safe. Also, you can't very well criticize a person for something they have no control over (picking the odd things out).\n\nIs it a seeming conflict between the reasoning of people and their innate mental model? I would say yes. However, the reason for such a conflict has perfectly understandable reasons. I think one of the best things you can do is try to influence/convince/help people remember that having sex just for fun/pleasure/bonding is ok under healthy circumstances, especially when it has no real impact on others.\n\nAlso, note that false religious beliefs are the true enemy in alot of this.",

It affords us the ability to misinterpret what people say and assume the other means the worst.\n\nA) I have post secondary education as well (BSc in Comp Sci, I wondered when we'd start comparing penis size. You win. Whatever.) thus it affords me a little understanding of logic (understatement made with implied sarcasm). You're referring to a \"false dichotomy\". My argument revolves around the how society perceives behaviour as being \"feminine\" or \"masculine\" based on the social constructs. I don't care what  might *actually* constitute masculine or feminine. It's irrelevant. I taking about how cultures perceive it and how association can change something's value.  (Things associated with being effeminate are often considered of lesser value by those who are consciously or unconsciously misogynistic) \nB) It was my understanding that your use of the term \"schema\" is what I understood to be a \"prototype\" and that the act of stereotyping was failed prototyping. I can accept that I'm wrong but I'm aware of the concept even if I have the wrong terms.\nC) My reference to a study is an attempt to at least apply support for my argument. This is one of the tenants of a good academic conversation is it not?  I can lead an academic to citation, but I cannot make him read. It's entirely up to you. I thought it had relevance.\nD) I do believe that a correlation between \"gay\" accent and being gay is a strong possibility. (This one point is delving into the realm of speculation. Feel free to disregard. I'm exploring an idea) I think it would be odd to assume that sexual orientation only drives the motivations for sexual behaviour without it affecting surrounding behaviours. Unless you really believe that we so cleanly compartmentalize our behaviours? As you suggest, sexual orientation wouldn't affect the inflections we use.  Anecdotally, gaydar is subconscious schema development that surpasses cultural stereotypes about the gay community. Hence spending time around gay people improves you ability to identify sexual orientation. (I've read articles that cite studies that suggest that gaydar has some accuracy) I think it's possible that we pick up on the \"true gay behaviours\".  If it were affected, the stereotypes could reign one's behaviour. The identification subconscious subtle behaviours through repeated observation and practice would yield results. Where am i going with this... Gaydar lends legitimacy to the idea that our sexual orientation affects our every day behaviours. This could include innate aspects of the tone of our voice. \nE) I am not suggesting that all gay people have this accent. I was talking about how there is a subset of gay people who have this accent (and straight people for that matter) against whom you are discriminating. \n\nThe label applied is telling of it's root. There's a social association with the \"accent\" that it's gay and thus there are a lot of people who make that mental association to discriminate against individuals who have those accents. I'd argue that this makes the lion-share of individuals. There are too many bullies out there who would rag on any kid who has any sort of \"effeminate\" tone to his voice gay or straight. I doubt you would disagree that this is homophobic.\n\nHowever, you maintain that there are those who do not make the association that the accent is gay but that it is affected by those for some conscious motivation. A need to feel a part of a community? Being Camp? \n\nF) Regardless, You find it insincere. This suggests that you are questioning someone's intent. Worse, you're making assumptions about their intent. Rather than giving them the benefit of the doubt. You stated \"Discrimination happens when we dislike something before we understand it\".  This is my point. You have not made it plain that you understand where it comes from. That people affect it only because they are insincere.\n\nI would cite myself as an example of someone who's voice contains some qualities of a \"gay\" accent. I'm not entirely straight acting. I'm not entirely \"gay acting\" either. As an adult, I'm sure I have something of a gay accent depending on context of comfort. I would say that I am conscious of my speech when I'm around those who may not know I'm gay and I'm uncertain of their receptiveness. In this case, I probably affect a \"straight\" accent. This is corroborated by those who are surprised when I come out to them and then comment later how much more \"gay\" I act after coming out.\n\nHowever, A while ago a friend of mine showed me a video when I was in junior highschool. Keep in mind, this was before the internet. I had *no* exposure to the gay community. \"Jack\" in \"Three's A Company\" is as close to \"gay\" behaviour that I had ever known. During that time frame I was bullied pretty heavily. It wasn't a long clip but it was me chatting with my friends.  I enjoying my lunch and talking about nothing in particular. I had to concede that it was incredibly obvious that my speech patterns had a certain \"flare\" about them that many would perceive as a \"gay\" accent. \n\nSo, where in an a hostile environment with *no* contact with the gay community would I have the motivation to affect this accent? To apply logic, I will give you the key to defeating my point. Provide me a single reason why I would behave this way if it were affected or insincere? It's just takes one.\n\nI know that one example isn't enough to prove a point. My own experience provide the foundation for my point but I know enough gay people and I trust my perception of their behaviour. There is nothing insincere about how they speak. They are just being themselves. There is enough example in my life that it is worth questioning people's attitudes when they proclaim their dislike for it.\n\ni mean I have no doubt that people truly *affect* the \"gay\" accent. My friends joke about it. Play with it and then go back to acting themselves. But there are some that don't affect it. It's not a joke. It's not over exaggerated. It's just a part of who they are.  \n\nI would hazard to suggest that a lot of the conflict in this forum of discussion comes from a disconnect between those who perceive it as an \"affected accent\" vs those who perceive it as a innate one. Those who perceive it as affected likely would cite cases of exaggerated behaviour and \"camp\". Drag Queens performing and the like. The \"over the topness\" pride parades that comes from the community as an effective survival instinct born of a time where we yelled and screamed to be heard but now has lost its point. \n\nThose who perceive it as innate would cite personal cases or friends. Perhaps they are just being self-righteous for kicks?\n\nAt the risk of sounding self-righteous, It's shitty comments like \"Do you find the gay accent a 'turn off'\" that makes the \"innate ones\" self-concious about how they speak and make them question their own value. The straight ones may take it better than the gay ones but so many kids these days are committing suicide that haven't declared their sexual orientation to anyone. \n\nGay or straight, our own community shouldn't be ragging on people for how they talk. It contributes to a hostile environment that,  at the very least, has all appearances of being homophobic.\n\nI hope the fact that I've spent the last 3 hours writing this and it's almost 4am suggest that my convictions aren't troll-based. I can't imagine a troll wasting this much time on an issue. On an unrelated note, some of this may not be as coherent as I would like. Please give me some benefit of the doubt that I'm not be contrary for the fun of it.\n\nPS: As for the English thing, I was being tongue-in-cheek as well. Being Canadian, our culture is often subsumed by American culture. I was \"defending\" my own. We like our U's and our metric system. :) \n\n\n",

The \"If something isn't 'A' it must be 'B'.\" logic is simple and easy and usually wrong.  If it's not a dog, it's a cat.  If it's not black, it's white.  If someone doesn't like something that I characterize as an attribute of homosexuality, that must mean they hate homosexuals.  \nb) assuming that gender is linear\n\nThe fact you assumed that I was making the argument that this was a simple argument makes this quote, \"You know who else \"Simplifies\" issues? Tea-party republicans. Sometimes issues are complex and require consideration before deferring to one's knee-jerk reaction and the superficial response to it. The lack of self-awareness and critical thinking that I see these days is disheartening.\",  hilarious.  \n\nThe reason i place quotation marks around the term \"gay\" in the phrase \"'gay' accent\" is to try and communicate my internal separation of the ideas of the accent and homosexuals.  \"As such\", (http://www.law.louisville.edu/node/2554) to indicate that I do not believe that the accent is gay on it's own but rather an accent separate and unrequired in the notion of homosexuality.  The accent is about as gay as nice shoes, small dogs or any other unrelated trait that others feel the need to lump into the behaviors that ACTUALLY constitute homosexuality.  By assuming these traits are somehow related to a sexual behavior, a certain degree of, not homophobia, but sexism (I suppose) is reinforced and reiterated through bad rhetoric and laziness unto the next generation.  YOU are making it into an entire population.  YOU assume that the \"gay\" accent is in fact a gay accent by trying to link it solely to a population.   I am petitioning that each homosexual is a person and not so easily placed into such a small confined box, that disliking a single accent is on par with disliking an entire people!  There is no difference between a \"James Earl Jones\" accent and a \"gay\" accent in terms of classification.  They're accents, not people.  \n\n\n\nAs for the source of discrimination,  that's easy.  Human beings have a wonderful system of stereotyping built into their brains which allows them to process huge amounts of information quickly.  The scaffolding we use to build our ideas around are called schemas.  Sometimes our schemas get screwed up because we lack the ability to rework them and refine them or because we were given false information.  We add on to these schemas continuously throughout our lives and thoroughly depend on them to get through the most basic situations.  because we have schemas, we can make assumptions about the world without empirically testing every situation we are in.   We see a man with a gun and we know to assume he is trouble and not to be fucked with, we see a man with a gun and a police uniform and we know he will not randomly shoot us for our wallet.  When the sun goes down we don't worry about  if it will come back.  \nDiscrimination happens when we dislike something before we understand it.  You might assume that a black man is a mugger if the only time you've ever seen a black man he was mugging someone.  If the only asian you've ever seen was a doctor, you might assume that makoto, down the street is a doctor, when in fact he's a grocery clerk.  If all the gay men you've ever seen have a \"gay\" accent, a tiny dog and nice shoes you might assume that all gay men have those things or that somehow those traits are what defines a gay man.  This is the beginning of discrimination.  Do you see where I'm going with this?  \n\nAnd I don't lie the \"gay\" (note the quotes and what they mean) accent because it is nasal and the emphasis and unnecessary elongation of vowels makes it sound like everything is super emotional, even when it isn't, which is what I said earlier in our little debate.  I find it insincere.  \n\nEnglish lesson:  \"colour\" and \"color\" are both acceptable, as are \"favorite\" and \"favourite\" When i said that i \"Americaned up your quote.\" I was trying to say, playfully, that I misquoted you, because I used the spell check.  \"Colour\" and \"favourite\" are not in my computer's dictionary because they aren't standard american english.  \n\n\nI'm still not going to even pretend to read the article you've suggested, even if I was tempted to open it.  I've read a thousand fucking articles on sexuality and it's development.  (MA in psych, OSU)\n\nAlso, you write with a conviction and idealism of a high school kid.  you know, that age just after you discover post-conventional reasoning and you think you're the first one to do so, but just before you discover the endless and idealism-killing complexities of relativism.  \n",

The lack of self-awareness and critical thinking that I see these days is disheartening.  \n\nThe issue I'm having a problem with is that \"disliking gay accents\" is a generalization that is abhorrent. It's not your favourite colour (Suck it up. They have 'U's in them. It's called \"English\". Learn it. ;) ) It's about a group of people who may or may not have control over how they talk and you've lassoed them all and labelled them all with \"voices that I find annoying\". How is that not discrimination?\n\nAs such, if discrimination exists, it has a source. A motivation. You have not offered up an alternative that at all makes sense to me that avoids the classification of \"bigotry\". If you said that James Earl Jones had an annoying voice, I *might* respect that it's just your preference (although I would hope you wouldn't say it to his face). However, this is an entire classification of people.\n\nActually, I leave that in your court. What is this source of discrimination? Why do some people find the \"gay accent\" intolerable?\n",

And while it may seem like the \"gay accent\" is learned because it seems to appear after someone comes out, it may just be as a result of someone not bothering to affect a straight accent any longer. ANd in early childhood, there's such a strong transition in your speech as you come into adolescence that it's easily masked until you're conscious of implications and would desire to affect a straight accent so you're not bullied in school.\n\nAs for \"Disliking the gay accent\" equating to homophobia, you have to ask yourself *WHY* you dislike it. As I've said in another thread of this post,  \"It's really not a stretch to take an association of the accent with feminine behaviour to a place where gay guys who are culturalized by patriarchal oppression would view such an accent as an undesirable trait because exhibiting any behaviour possibly viewed as effeminate because they feel that they have to justify their own masculinity that is otherwise undermined by their sexual orientation. AKA internalized homophobia.\"\n\nThis is supported by a study that acknowledges that the \"gay accent\" exists and that it fits on a gender spectrum on the side that's associated with feminine behaviour. \nhttp://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~cla-acl/2002/Smyth_Rogers_2002.pdf\n\n",

Anthropological investigation suggests that gay specific language and effectations are related to typical \"male initiation.\"  Simply put, you must conform to your new tribes behavior or be ostracised.\n\nRead much much more about these studies by reading the Introduction section of [\"Out in Public: Reinventing Lesbian/Gay Anthropology in a Globalizing World.\"](http://www.scribd.com/doc/26625973/Lewin-Out-in-Public-Reinventing-Lesbian-Gay-Anthropology-in-a-Globalizing-World-1405191023)\n\nOne of the few comprehensive Linguistic studies of the Gay Affectation is [\"Phonetics, Gender, and Sexual Orientation.\"](http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~cla-acl/2002/Smyth_Rogers_2002.pdf)  It discusses the unconscious adoption of gay speech patterns; how this should be divided into young male children that adopted feminine characteristics vs teenage/adult gay males that learn the affectation culturaly.\n\nYou can read about \"Lavander Lexicons\" aka Gayspeak, Gay Slang and general gay idetified distintive language adoption and how it's not a function of being homosexual but a cultural survival tool.  [\"The Voice of Others: Identity, Alterity and Gener Normativity among Gay Men in Isreal.\"](http://webspace.qmul.ac.uk/dharbour/18-QMOPAL-Levon-Voice.pdf)\n\n*All three of those are online links to read the whole book/article.*\n\nI will skip any Historical texts because unlike the language study, there are thousands and thousands to pick from.  If you did go looking you\nmight disover that in additional to internaly adopting specific language\ntraits to reaffirm solitary inside the oppressed miniority, externally \nhomosexuals were forced to self identify per social mores.  In the more accepting privitve socities this meant being classified as a \"Third Gender\" or having to conform to the opposite generes roles (dress as a woman, speak as a woman, etc.).\n\n**TLDR: Recent studies seem to agree that it is a cultural identifier but one caused/originating from several sources.  Self Identification. Gender Role Adoption.  Protectionism - unity vs external ostracism.  Learned English language specific cultural behavior (first written about in Victorian London.)  Etc.

I think its kind of odd that everyone can recognize when people are relying on racial stereotypes, but when it comes to gay and lesbian stereotypes, its all of a sudden a different story.\n\nFor example, if anyone ever came out with an anti-racism video that exclaimed \"I love black people because they love fried chicken, are great at basketball, and can sing like Whitney Houston,\" there would be trouble, and rightfully so.  That being said, what's this chick's explanation?\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_fQVhM9CnY",

Yes forced, as in any gay person I've asked about it has told me they had to practice doing it for years until they didn't have to concentrate on doing it and just spoke that way. I have met straight people who do just naturally sound like they have a gay lisp, and it's fucking torture as yes, everyone does instantly think they're gay. Say what you want about societal pressures and  accepted heteronorms, you're not going to change it for the next 30 years and their life is more or less fucked until THEY change their voice to not have the typical lisp. (say what you like, but they cannot keep a girlfriend, as every single one that at first said they liked that lisp soon found it annoying and made them think they weren't a real guy, or were just in the closet when they're not.)\n\n I just find it to be so incredibly fake and shallow when gay men purposefully change their voice to do the stereotypical gay lisp that I just lose all respect for them, and feel sorry. Casualty of war though for those gays born sounding like that. You are the minority.\n\nIt always has been just a way to tell people you're gay. It's like wearing an ear-ring in just your right ear, or whatever other cultural marker you have where you live. If you weren't born sounding that way it is not who you are, in so much as the shirt you wear is not who you are. It is just another gimmick which I, personally, find unattractive.\n\nSorry.",

But I see guys like this all the time. There's an affected, inauthentic butchness, yet it also looks and feels kind of washed-up. I wish it weren't so easy to put some folks into categories, and I don't think most gay men are as easily pigeonholed. But some basically try too hard. \n\nThe guys I know/see who are the most authentically masculine (in a conventional sense): a) don't have to work that much at it, b) aren't so strongly put off by guys who are more feminine (in a conventional sense), and c) don't promote masculinity as a form of identity.\n\nEdited: for typos/clarity.",

It's like people who say \"Not to be racist, but...\", then you *know* they're about to say something racist.\n\nOP knows full well there are plenty of people who don't like effeminate guys, just look on gay.com/adam4adam/manhunt or whatever... 80% of the profiles will say \"no fems\". It isn't some obscure quirk that needs a DAE. OP is just looking for reaffirmation of his \"annoyance\" at fem guys. It really serves no other purpose, as no one is forcing anyone hook up with fem guys.\n\nThe only explanation I can see for this phenomenon is that people like OP are trying to (subconsciously or not) somehow separate and elevate themselves above people they (and society) view as lower in status - those who are obviously gay and stand out (read: conditioned internalized homophobia). But the super flamboyant ones were the ones who were at the forefront of gay rights *because* they couldn't hide behind a \"straight-acting\" facade. It's totally disingenuous to enjoy the fruits of the gay rights movement and then look down on them using the heteronormative perspective.\n\n/rant, and if it matters contextually, I pass for \"straight\"",

However, if you were to bring one other gay person around, it was like, \"OMG HELLLEWWWWWWWWWWWW HANNNEYYYY!\"  On the phone, in the house, in the food court - if there was an audience for his gayness, his voice would change remarkably. \n\nWe lost touch a few years back, but I can only assume he got over this as he got older, and just acted natural. I can hope. ",

They had a safety program for those with abusive relationships, and jack ass parents. \n\nMean I\u2019m Pagan. That community isn\u2019t exactly loved. \u201cDevil worshipers\u201d and \u201cblack magic\u201d got used a lot where I was from. And it is really scary for some. So scary that the Witch trials took many lives, abd it wasn\u2019t the only time people died just because they were suspected of not being a perfect (insert major religion of the time.) Do I get upset when someone isn\u2019t Pagan and acting it? No. \n\nI have a trauma disorder that constantly makes me afraid to tell people about it. More afraid than I have ever been about coming out of the closet. It\u2019s constantly stigmatized, and vilified in the media. Am I mad that the actor doesn\u2019t have it? No I\u2019m pissed the writers made a illness people actually have and made it evil, or comical like were a big joke. One of my tests to see if someone will accept me for it is to tell them about not being straight, and a few other things. I\u2019m always terrified they are gonna stick me on antipsychotics, even though it\u2019s proven to not be helpful. Or into a mad house.\n\nAm I mad when the actor has never been through depression? No.. though I think it may help them understand the roll better to put it across better. They don\u2019t have to be.\n\nMy husband is autism spectrum, yet he isn\u2019t mad when actors are not autistic playing the roll. He\u2019s mad when they are a joke prop.\n\nThe point is that whatever is invisible can be acted. If it\u2019s done well, and in a respectful manner I\u2019m ok with it. That is an act of love for me. To have someone take the time to get it right even if it\u2019s not who they are. I love that actually. Every single one of these examples can be painful. Can hurt careers and friendships. Have been stigmatized throughout society. There was a time when mental illness was met with a drill to the head to \u201cget the demons out\u201d now days they are putting bad practices like that on display as wrong. Do I care if the actor portraying the character strapped to a table getting painfully electrocuted actually has the disorder? No. They are showing the horrors of the past, and the horrors of what some places still do. They want a bad name to go to it. It means the world to me that they are standing up to show the world that for us.\n\nAlso it\u2019s invisible. Who are we to say they just aren\u2019t open about X invisible thing? No one. We\u2019re all hiding something for the world. The more anger you put into it honestly.. the more people feel they should hide.",

Even though the first relationship was straight, it would've been illegal in many places; even though the second relationship was gay, it would've been legally permissable - the government sees people as their assigned sex at birth even if that's inaccurate.\n\nAs for terminology, you can avoid the whole gay marriage vs same sex marriage deal by just calling it marriage equality.",

The proper course of behaviour depends on how heavy the moderation of the forum is, and I don't think it's appropriate to have it involve scarlet letters emblazoned wherever they go. If they are repeatedly saying things that are inappropriate, and the level of moderation is such that this is a forum where people get banned, then ban them.\n\n> However, if I say that you should be educating me right now, and if you aren't willing to then your unwillingness justifies my ignorance, then that is concern trolling.\n\nI don't agree with that, either. I consider one of the purposes of this forum to be education, and thus expect anyone engaging in conversation to be willing to educate the other person about their point of view. Transgender 101 is a nice resource, but it's really too dense in a lot of cases, and more informed people can be considerate and direct people in the correct direction. For example, I don't see any article that obviously would be discussing the difference between gender expression and gender identity, and that seems like a frequent topic of discussion because people are under the impression that gender is a social construct.\n\nThe OP actually mentions some specific examples, like \"doesn't butt sex hurt?\". I don't think that's an inappropriate question, and I think not asking it leads to a lot of misconceptions. Until I read something posted on this subreddit, I actually thought that anal sex was much more pervasive in the gay community than it is in actuality.",

But slapping a passive aggressive label on to try and ostracize the people in this reddit who are making it an unsafe place solves absolutely nothing.  Not a goddamn thing.  Those people are still here.  They will still post the same shit.  And they will still target the same people.\n\nIf there is a threat to the trans* members of this community, you ban them.  And if they make a new account, you ban that one too when they start attacking members again.  The argument \"oh they'll just make a multi\" is a piss poor excuse, since they can do the same bloody thing with an account you give the scarlet tag to.  As a moderator, you have to be ever vigilant if you are going to adopt an aggressive moderation policy.  That means heavily monitoring this reddit for these sorts of things, encouraging the use of the report function and the adding of additional moderators to the moderation team.  Two people cannot watch the postings of over 30,000 people and expect to properly moderate out the transphopic, homophopic, biphobic, etc. post made here.\n\nIf you want to make this reddit a safer place for trans* redditors, you need to fucking step up and get serious.  Lay out the rules.  Enforce them via warnings and bans. And get a mod team capable of ensuring that everyone here is watched out for and can post and share and do so without passive aggressive, high school bullshit from the moderators.",

He was given red flair for posts (according to rmuser, link within the post I linked here) debating with another user about whether it was our responsibility to educate other users. His red flair was something like \"needs to be educated. (paraphrase)\" It was a blatant misuse of the policy and shows that it won't be used in a good way. It wasn't a transphobic comment in any way whatsoever, it was a disagreement with a mod. I believe he was wrongfully given the red flair, which is why it was removed, because the mods eventually realized they wrongfully gave it to him as well. It's been abused once, it'll be abused again and should not be the policy of this subreddit. ",

I know that I would support going the way of r/fitness, and having the community engage in an \"LGBT FAQ\" to link above all posts (not just in the sidebar, no one reads that).\n\nI realize that there's a \"transgender 101\" link in the sidebar, but I do think that a community project that could be linked to any time someone makes those kinds of trans-unfriendly posts would make r/lgbt feel more like a cohesive group, and less like rabble that needs to be restricted from above.\n\nPeople on r/lgbt, generally, *want* to be educated, *want* to be sensitive.  We're already kinda an ingroup.  I think that if the response to subtle transphobia was consistently a link to the \"transgender FAQ\" section of something that we had put together as a community, people would just inherently be more likely to support the FAQ than the original comment, even if they wouldn't have recognized it as offensive in the first place.",

I was actually referring specifically to the particular link that ButterflySammy has posted over and over again.  Pointing out that the LG forgets about the T is not marginalizing cis people, and based on the constant reposts and the particular comment, it is extremely frustrating.\n\nI do not have a problem with people asking for clarification on things, but because it was brought up, in my experience (as a trans person) when I do explain the issue I'm having it's often ignored or downplayed by cis people anyway in favor of gay and lesbian issues, or people argue with me instead, largely with stuff like the word \"tranny\" which so many LGB people think they can use freely.  This shouldn't have to be something I need to explain, and if I say it's offensive it isn't something you should need clarification on.  Same reason a gay man should be able to tell me that I am being offensive if I use the word \"fag\" without me complaining that I'm a member of the community and therefore it should be OK or asking him whether or not considering it comparable to a racial slur is accurate.\n\nThose are small scale things that are really common at /r/LGBT and elsewhere.  Things that would be considered no-brainers if they related to LGB issues are treated like complex puzzles if they relate to the T, and they reflect bigger issues that trans people just get tired of.  I remember Joe Solmonese giving this big speech to Southern Comfort once about how they were totally in it all for us too, just months before the HRC dropped support for an inclusive ENDA in order to try shoving one through without trans protections.  And I know that the knee-jerk reaction to this is for people to say \"Hey, I'm not the HRC though, I didn't do that!\" or, to be topical, \"I can't be responsible for the failings of people before me!\"  But even on a small, modern scale people do this stuff all the time and then wonder why trans people are upset about it.\n\nThere is a point after which claiming ignorance is just no longer appropriate.  That's what the problem is, not that people ask questions.  I don't think a sincere question falls under this category at all, although in some cases I would advise Google.",

You could go to work and talk about Neil Patrick Harris's adopted kids and how cute you think his husband is.  You could discuss the girl that you had a crush on until she found out you were a lesbian and would no longer talk to you with the neighbors.  Maybe you could go on r/funny and tell them about how when you came out as bi, your mom said you were probably *really* just gay or mad at women/men.  \n\nBut you don't.  You come here, and the reason you come here is because you want your experiences to be heard and discussed with other people who have a cursory knowledge of homo/bi/pan sexuality and still see you as just anyone else.  You know that if you go somewhere else, you're likely to wade through a lot of excrement before you can discuss anything useful if you don't give up first, and that the wading will leave you feeling exhausted and dirty.  It might even be worse than that.  Maybe your neighbors run the homeowner's association and, since hearing that you're gay, want to propose insidious guidelines to force you out.  Perhaps somebody at work would decide that you might look at them in the bathroom and has told Human Resources about your \"sexual harassment\" or maybe everyone you know is mostly nice but just sometimes can't resist knocking the conversation off the rails with \"doesn't butt sex hurt?\" or \"who's the butch and who's the bitch?\"  Of course some of us have been very lucky to have relatively open-minded people in our surroundings, and with only a few months or weeks of patient gaysplaining, they no longer say stupid things, but they will still never fully understand what it's like to be 14 years old and wonder why they have crushes on their friends instead of the opposite sex the way they were taught it was supposed to happen, or what it's like just to want a family like everyone else and know that even the most basic aspects of achieving this, like finding a home together, will be riddled with sometimes insurmountable hurdles.\n\nAs a community, we take it for granted that the people here will understand these things and not make idiotic evolutionary or religious arguments about why we should consider that maybe the status quo is good for us.\n\nWhen rmuser and I instated the new guidelines, it was because we could no longer ignore the fact that the longstanding policy of community self-moderation had been effective *only* in creating this environment for LGBs.  Dozens upon dozens of trans people who badly wanted to feel like a part of our community had appealed to us.  For a long time, we simply insisted they downvote and for a long time, it worked.  However, as the community grew to over 36,000, this tactic lost effectiveness and the trans members of our community felt even more overwhelmed by yet another environment that had promised trans inclusiveness and delivered nothing but another cisnormative burden at their feet.  \n\nConsider how you would have felt if threads during the DADT repeal had been filled with appeals to consider the feelings of soldiers who don't wish to serve with gays or how you'd feel if threads about the Boy Scouts of America were filled with \"won't somebody please think of the straight children?\"  Most of us would have no problem identifying such sentiments as concern trolling.  However, when it happened to trans women in the Girl Scouts posts, many readers were quick to defend exactly these things with the mantra \"but it's just a different opinion!\"  Frankly, rmuser and I were disgusted to see the same minimizing, patronizing language that NOM, Exodus, and Fox News hide behind when they're being unapologetic homophobes *by our own and against our own*.\n\nThe red flair was an attempt to moderate and sidestep the inevitable influx of alt accounts.  It was meant to let our readers know that this person meant harm without silencing anyone.  We hate to silence people, and we really hate chasing down dozens of alt accounts.  We flaired 3 people out of 36,000 (that's 1 in 12,000).  One was talked to and agreed not to do it again.  His flair was removed.  There are now two people flaired (1 in 18,000).  They seem to be everywhere because they are two heavy commenters, but they are still only two.  We had hoped that was all we would have to do because this is a well-meaning community which, we hope, *wants* to extend the same comfortable environment to our trans members, but we suppose time will tell.\n\nWe know some don't like it, but we're sticking to our guns.  We will likely err on the side of allowing too much, and we know we will probably not achieve a completely safe space, but reporting will help us sort them out.  We will not back down.  This community *will* be moderated.\n\nThank you.\n",

Inclusivity isn't and shouldn't be a scarce resource.\n\nBDSM has been a part of the queer rights movement, historically, and a lot of us still participate in BDSM as well. Kink and polyamory struggles deserve to be recognized and resolved alongside our struggles.\n\nThe LGBT movement was actively slandered by the media as sexually deviant and promoting pedophilia throughout it's history. That didn't stop them from embracing the term \"queer liberation\" and it's not stopping the LGBT community right now, either.\n\nAnticipated possible, but not potential, futures are not a good reason for us to edit our self- identification. The increasing exclusivity of many of our local LGBT movements are pushing people like me to walk away and embrace a new acronym, so that we can find other like-minded and more inclusive community members (and eventually build a movement of our own).\n\nWe are not responsible for the way others see us. Those who see and treat us differently are the problem, not us. Not everything can be resolved through PR (social optics). It makes us more palatable, but it doesn't help fight oppression and discrimination.\n\nWe have a difference of opinion on some things. That's all.",

Personally I think that LGBT+ rights fit better under the GSRM umbrella. Each group under the umbrella has their own goals and may not identify with the movement that LGBT+ people strive for (queer liberation). A heterosexual dom and sub relationship has not much in common with us, but they would also be considered GSRM. Nothing wrong with that, but there\u2019s no guarantee that they are ally\u2019s to queer liberation either.\n\nI hope I\u2019m making enough sense here, as I just got back from a party and am a little tipsy. Someone please correct me if my interpretation is vastly off track. Much appreciated",

Despite this it is not useful to just start making a list of who is \"in\" as that naturally leads to gate keeping behavior and the constant posts we all see of young people questioning if they belong in the community. What we should be focused on and what truly ties us together as a community is that we are a ***minority***.

It was originally just POC, but at some point academics decided BIPOC was better to show that while all POC have faced obstacles due their race, black and indigenous people have faced a unique and harsher set of obstacles. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t diminish the other POC who don\u2019t have their own individual markers in the term and get lumped together under the POC part. \n\nFor a long time the L, G, B and T faced the brunt of then obstacles. The others mainly faced obstacles more for being mistaken for them. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the others don\u2019t belong or don\u2019t face obstacles, but that situations are not equal. \n\nIt\u2019s part of the issue with trying to present us as one unified community rather than what we actually are, a coalition of various communities that face oppression rooted in a common ideology. \n\nBut that\u2019s a whole different discussion. \n\nUltimately however I\u2019m still in favor of a neutral new , all inclusive term. I\u2019m just saying that the issue of not everyone having their own letter is a bit overstated. And not pointing that at you. In general. \n\n\nAll that is, however, academic argument. Interesting philosophically but doesn\u2019t solve the problem if peoples feelings on the issue. \n\nI\u2019m not invested really in defending LGBTQ as a term but more in opposing Queer as a blanket term. I do think LGBTQ is actually less problematic, but if that goes I\u2019m not upset by that. \n\nUltimately if we are going to insist on perfectly inclusive terminology then let\u2019s actually make it perfectly inclusive. \n\nI\u2019m open to suggestions if people don\u2019t like GSRM.",

You accept that you don't like being a part of queer, so I'm sure you sympathise with other people who don't get to have their own letter who don't empathise with queer. That's why I brought it up, not to judge you, but simply to point out a flaw.\n\nAnd my opinion is if we are to use a name that doesn't include everyone, why should we prioritise some marginalised groups over others? The current acronym is great for you, you're the second letter. And lots of people call us the Gays^(TM) anyway, but you can see how people who aren't gay might feel excluded, especially when other members of the community have excluded us from the community previously, in more significant ways.",

LGBTQ is \"lesbians, gays, bisexuals, trans folks, and everyone else\". People aren't gonna be thinking about the everyone else.",

I would literally prefer we say the gay community over the acronym since it is just so much easier and the fact that you aren\u2019t trying to stuff everyone in makes it legitimately feel more inclusive to me since i dont just get stuffed into a \u2018+\u2019.\n\nIf i had to choose a termthough i would go with queer, it has alth the benefits of just saying the gay community, and none of the downsides of either that or the acronym. Further queer is the accepted academic term in many places fromwhat i understand and we have been using it consistently since stonewall, so. ore thanhalf a century at this point. As for the whole \u201cqueer is a slur\u201d thing: so is literally every word we have. If one of our words isnt being used as a slur today its only because it isnt yet well know enough. For any word you find or make there is a whole army of people waiting to take that word and use it like a knife to open you up from stomach to throat.\n\nTerms like SAGA, GRSM, and MOGAI do also exist but they are just much less known and less used. Further frankely they are less inclusive. You get a cishet white christian guy who is a communist and paints his nails and does makeup every week? sure, he can be queer. For other terms though they just get lumped into \u201callies\u201d rather than being seen as properly part of the community and the struggle for freedom and i think thats kinda lame.",

All other sexual orientations fall into the spectrum between these points with a true pansexual being exactly halfway between the two.  Asexual people don\u2019t fall on the spectrum.  They are outside of it.  If you had to make a graph including asexuality and sexual orientations, you would end up with a 2D graph with one axis being their orientations and the other being the degree to which the person is sexually interested in people. Interestingly, a mostly asexual person can still fall on the straight-gay spectrum; however a truly asexual person would somehow not exist on the straight-gay axis at all.  I\u2019ve seen them classified as pansexual but uninterested, but is that really the case?  If they are fully asexual, where they would be on the other axis is completely unimportant, as they are removed from orientation entirely",

This bothers me because I feel like we A-spec people are pretty much invisible to the broader society (and also to the community). For example: We don't have good representation in Media. Many TV shows include gay and lesbian couples, sometimes also trans and bi people but a-spec identitys are almost nowhere to be seen. If we are not even mentioned in the acronym I feel like we are not even seen by the Community. \n\nI get it there are more identitys that are commonly left out and do not get enough representation: poly, pan, 2S... the acronym becomes really long and unpronouncable if we want to always include all possible letters. \nThat is the reason why I do not like the acronym. I prefer queer because I feel like it is way more inclusive. I get that it was used as a slur and some people do not like queer because of that. \nSo do you have preferences? Do you like the acronym?

If you're bisexual who thinks that other bisexuals who say \"everyone is bi!\" is just as ignorant as gay or straight people who say \"nobody is bi!' then my hat is off to you.\n\nHowever it annoys me to NO END when a bisexual complains that noone acknowledges that they are really bisexual....and then rambles off about the Kinsey Scale and that EVERYONE is actually bisexual.\n\nSo gay or straight people aren't allowed to deny or define your sexual orientation...but it's perfectly okay for a bisexual to say everyone is actually bisexual to a lesser or greater extent and that gay or straight people are actually rare or don't exist?\nHypocrisy at the very least.\n\nI am not a bisexual. Never had an interest in the opposite sex. Yet I have many bisexual friends who troll me and say that I 'could' be sexually or emotionally attracted to a woman if I 'found the right girl'. Or I'm really a bisexual with strong same sex attractions. Or that I'm Kinsey 5 (Predominantly homosexual, only incidentally heterosexual whether it has happened or not...) since Kinsey 6s are \"very rare\" or \"don't exist\".\n\nWhat gives bisexuals the right to cast all gay and straight people under THEIR sexual orientation and then complain that the very same gay or straight people say they don't exist?\nAnd the \"no labels\" schtick is just a cop out.\n\nIf there are 'no labels' then by that logic there are no 'gay' or 'straight' people. 'Gay' is a label. 'Straight' is a label. Why label yourself as either? You could be attracted to either one? People are attracted to people! Yadda Yadda.\n\n\"No Labels\" is just another phrase for \"Everyone is Bi!\"\n\nSo a purposed deal to bisexuals who think like this: Stop telling everyone else that they're all really bisexual like them and we'll stop telling you that you're confused, greedy or a closeted gay who refuses to call him or herself gay.",
