        "body": "Two weeks ago I had an self induced abortion at 9 weeks with only misoprostol pills that I bought via a close friend of my brother (I lied and said the pills were for another person I knew) and I ended up getting only four pills which didn't add up since I gave him a large sum of money which would have normally gotten me at least ten pills, but I ended up using the four pills anyway because I had no other choice other than telling my family about it (or the person I regularly had sex with, since we are just friends with benefits, so we're not in a actual relationship and we're not that close to the point i can trust him with this without being afraid he would be judgemental about it) which would have led to a huge ruckus and aborting would no longer be an option for me and I don't want to have a child right now and I know some people will say I wanted it but I usually use protection and when I  don't I make sure I take the emergency pills but I guess they didn't work this time since my circle is a mess and I never know when I'm actually ovulating. \n\nSo, I used the four pills I had, and had intense abdominal pain for nine days straight and on the first  day I passed a huge amount of clots and the next three days I passed clots but in a moderate amount and just bled for the remaining week and a half.\n\nWhat scares me is that I still feel nauseous, bloated, gassy, still experience mild cramps and my breasts still feel slightly tender sometimes like when I initially found out I was pregnant and I'm scared maybe I had more than one fetus and was only able to abort one and I can't go to a clinic to get an ultrasound since I live in a country in Africa where aborting intentionally could get you in jail.\n\nCan someone please advise me on this, I feel really stressed about this and I've been told I can't get a pregnancy test until three weeks after an abortion.\n\nUpdate; It's been some time but I got caught up in some things and forgot to update,).\n The pills worked!, which made me so happy and gave me the relief that I needed. I followed your advices and went to a gynecologist for an ultrasound and she found no presence of an existing pregnancy.\nI just want to thank everyone who helped give me advice and checked on me in my messages, may God bless you all. And for everyone who is going through or went through this situation I hope you're doing okay physically, emotionally and mentally and don't ever doubt yourself and blame yourself for making this decision. Sending all my love to each one of you \u2764",

If you can, it's a great idea to gather some supplies ahead of time including ibuprofen, menstrual pads, a heating pad or hot water bottle (for the cramps), comfortable clothes, and food that's easy to heat up and enjoy (best to avoid spicy, greasy, and fatty foods as you might be nauseated from the medication). People also like to get their space (bedroom and bathroom) clean and cozy and stock up on shows, movies, or books to keep your mind busy.\n\nSince you're working with a clinic for your MA, feel free to ask them what you can take for pain and nausea.

You may feel nausea - ask them for an anti-vomiting tablet. I'd taken the misoprostol at 7 pm and the cramping intense enough at 3-4 am that it woke me up from sleep. Unfortunately, it does take time for everything to pass :( I was in pain for about 2-3 days (aborted at 6 weeks), and the pain gradually abated with the blood [flow.](https://flow.It) The physical process from taking all tablets to stopping of bleeding was about one week, two days over my regular period. \n\nIf you can, get your friends to check on you, line up some TV shows, get some light soup, and any other comfort food you like (I got myself dark chocolate). Just try to eat a little light and in small portions cause you may already feel nauseous. Have someone sleepover if possible! Get as much sleep as you can.

This was also my first time doing something like this so please don't judge, I am already judging myself.\n\nAnyways, I told him about the situation last weekend too and that I'll be getting an abortion this weekend (which he was supportive of) and he said to let him know if I need anything along with sending me details of an abortion clinic etc \n\nMy issue is that he has not once texted me all week to check in/see how I'm doing. I've started MA process today and I'm so devastated that he has not said a word (knowing it starts today too)\n\nI know I'm not in a relationship with this person but it's breaking my heart that he didn't offer to meet me/call me about it/ is not offering any emotional support whatsoever. This, along with hormones and the sadness of going through an abortion in general is literally causing me to cry my eyes out everyday.\n\nI'm contemplating texting him about how I'm feeling but wondering if that would be a bad idea? Has anyone had a similar situation?",

Also, every abortion (and every reproductive experience)  is a unique experience and can be different from others, so it's not necessarily a bad sign that this abortion is taking longer than previous abortions.\n\n  \n1:\u00a0Swallow one 200mg pill of mifepristone with water.  \n2:\u00a0Wait 24-48 hours.  \n3:\u00a0Place 4 misoprostol pills (200 mcg each) under your tongue and hold them there for 30 minutes as they dissolve. You should not speak or eat for these 30 minutes, so it is good to be someplace quiet where you will not be disturbed. After 30 minutes, drink some water and swallow everything that is left of the pills. This is also a good time to take a painkiller like ibuprofen, as the cramping will start soon. You should begin bleeding and cramping within 3 hours of using the 4 misoprostol pills.  \n4:\u00a024 hours after taking the 4 misoprostol pills, if you didn\u2019t start to bleed, or if you are unsure that the abortion worked, place 4 more pills of misoprostol under your tongue. Hold them there for 30 minutes as they dissolve. After 30 minutes, drink some water and swallow everything that is left of the pills.\n\nJust to make sure your wife knows she is not alone in having more than one abortion, she can visit this website: 2+ Abortions Worldwide.

I took Tylenol and advil before and during and it helped a lot. I don\u2019t want to sugar coat it, it\u2019s not easy but it also is incredibly easy basically once you make the decision the process starts and it\u2019s over before you know it. Don\u2019t worry you aren\u2019t alone. Simply not being ready is a good reason simply not wanting kids is a good reason. It is your choice. It hurts me that other countries believe that it shouldn\u2019t be your choice. If you have any questions please don\u2019t hesitate to ask. I have not had the medical procedure abortion so I can\u2019t really give advice on that but I will give my support \u2665\ufe0f",

I then found out a week or so later that I was pregnant. This whole process lasted over a month of being sick. I got scans when I went in to organise an abortion and they could only see my pregnancy sac but no development so they said I was going to miscarry anyway but they didn\u2019t know when that would be, I just wanted to get it done with so that I didn\u2019t feel so sick and emotional all the time. \nI started the abortion last Thursday and then took the second dose of tablets on Saturday- I was in a lot of pain and ended up fainting in the hallway, I get bad periods from my PCOS and I knew the abortion would be painful but I haven\u2019t experienced pain that bad (and I don\u2019t want to scare people so I\u2019m just giving my experience because everyone\u2019s is different!!) I\u2019m still passing large clots today and I\u2019ve also flown home back to my parents that would be horrified if they found out I even got pregnant and even more if they knew I had the abortion as they are religious and very against it, so I can\u2019t tell them or get support from them. \n\nMy friends have helped me but they don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m going through which totally isn\u2019t their fault but I feel so alone and isolated. I\u2019ve had a horrible year, I got dumped and then a few weeks later raped (by someone else) in April, I went back to the guy I was talking to but it turns out he was using me for sex even though he knew how vulnerable I was from the rape, I changed uni courses so started again in September and have now missed a month and a half including three assessments, my mum (who I never got on with due to a lot of emotional abuse and neglect including causing my eating disorder) went into cardiac arrest in august and I had to give her cpr, then I had to care for all the family and constantly update her friends, family and work and do all the housework because my dad couldn\u2019t cope with anything (which I totally get wasn\u2019t his fault) and then went back to start uni three days later, I haven\u2019t been able to process anything because everything has literally happened one thing after another. I still get nightmares about the rape and flashbacks of how my mum looked and sounded when I was giving the cpr, and even how distraught my dad was. Ever since then, my mum has been a new person and has been so nice to me, which I also don\u2019t know how to process as I feel like I didn\u2019t have a mum all 22 years I\u2019ve lived, it\u2019s nice to have one but I get scared incase it won\u2019t last and I don\u2019t even know how to communicate to her as it\u2019s like talking to a completely different person. I feel like this abortion is a breaking point for me as I haven\u2019t been able to breathe and be upset about everything that\u2019s happened this year. \n\nI knew that I needed to have to abortion because I\u2019ve just restarted uni, I have no money at all and I\u2019m not mentally stable enough to have a child, but I\u2019ve always dreamed of having children so I feel so guilty and ungrateful even though it was going to end in miscarriage anyways (which also worries me incase I can\u2019t have children with my pcos). I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019m meant to process it all and get through it. In 2019 and 2020 my eating disorder was at its worst and I spent those two years suicidal and attempting a few times, I\u2019m not suicidal anymore but I still do struggle with depression and anxiety and I\u2019m just afraid that if I don\u2019t process these then I get just lower and end up back to where I was before. \n\nSorry for the mega long post but I just need help on how to deal with all of this or at least where to start!!",

An abortion is a chosen miscarriage -- something is not right \\*outside\\* the pregnant person's body in the context of their life, so the body's brain -- in its wisdom -- chooses to release the pregnancy. Whether chosen or not, pregnancy losses are deserving of respect, dignity and honor. \n\nNo matter what you decide to do, you can trust your inner wisdom much more than you can trust the silence, shame, stigma and cruel lies that surround abortion care. \n\nTo help you get more clarity, try going through this Pregnancy Options Workbook: [https://www.pregnancyoptions.info/](https://www.pregnancyoptions.info/)\n\nI used to think terrible thoughts about myself, too -- until I truly reflected on where that belief came from. I realized much of what I have learned through society and culture are the ideas of men, because men have been in charge of the world for centuries. They don't even have periods. \n\nI really regret ever thinking that men in religion or politics or elsewhere were legitimate authorities on anything to do with our bodies, our sexuality and our reproduction. \n\nAlso, I always notice that men are not in this forum (or anywhere) shaming themselves and punishing themselves and calling themselves pieces of shit, even though without them pregnancies don't happen. \n\nI send lots of love to you and hope you will trust yourself, no matter what you decide. And may your heart open wide to yourself with tenderness and love. That's what you deserve, whether you continue or end your pregnancy.",

I broke up with this person a few months after I turned 18, but it should have been the moment those words came out of their lips.\n\nIt's been 10 years since I had an abortion and that decision has stood the test of time. This person was permanently unemployed at the time and still is permanently unemployed. Now has four children with someone else and is still living in the same little town. And I thank my luck stars every day that I am not tied to this person for the rest of my life.

It can be a hard process, and it\u2019s one we don\u2019t go through everyday. It can be confusing. For me I was extremely anxious and upset before my abortion\u2026. Because I didn\u2019t want it and wanted to get it over with and move on. I kept pushing out thoughts of being sad at first because I was like, I don\u2019t want this rn so I\u2019m not allowed to be sad. WRONG. You are. You\u2019re allowed to feel whatever it is your feeling. There\u2019s no wrong feelings in this process. I was at the end of 14 weeks when I had my abortion and I had an ultrasound done a week before my appointment. I saw it and denied the pictures at first but a little while after the SA procedure I emailed where I had my ultrasound done and asked if I could have them. For me, I got them bc I realized I\u2019m allowed to feel and grieve how I need to. Some days I want to forget, some days I don\u2019t. At first all I felt was relief, but after a few days I felt alone (although having a supportive partner), felt like I was mourning a loss, and had trouble not thinking about it. It gets better with time. You just have to give yourself grace. For me, it helped finally telling my partner how I felt bc it felt like although he may not understand rn, I was releasing my feelings out loud. Talking to other women, ur partner, a therapist, or even people on here may help just because you can feel heard and express how YOURE feeling. Sending you love and support.

One of my biggest feelings was feeling like a failure. The goals life ripped away from me already made me sad, but then having to abort her/him mostly cause of the situation I was in made those \u2018failures\u2019 feel even bigger. The confliction you are feeling is normal. I used to study counselling so when I started to feel mixed emotions (relief and sorrow, like I made a choice but I didn\u2019t want to have to make it, not wanting to carry the weight of raising a child but missing getting to raise it, the list goes on) and I allowed myself to have the space to feel conflicting thing. I allow myself to feel such sorrow over my abortion even though I would do it again if I was forced to be in a time machine at that moment. \nNow for what I did to cope\n1. Took it day by after a few months the pain became less excruciating\n2. Connected with a friend who had been in my shoes. Her resonating with me brought me relief a lot of us understand each other more than you would think\n3. I read the stories on this sub and the links in the side bar to more stories of women in my shoes and their collective stories helped me process and feel not alone, not unique in this and gave me strength. \n4. i wrote. I am a poet as a hobby. So I would allow myself yo express and manifest my feelings if I needed to   \n5. Allow yourself space to do what you need to. I almost bought a necklace to remember the child I couldn\u2019t have. That on the surface can seem weird. But I told myself if the feelings didn\u2019t pass and I needed an object to manifest this feeling tangibly that i would allow myself to do that. (ended up moving past the feeling) but if you think of similar solutions you feel like your not \u2018societally \u2018 allowed to do, ignore society and listen to your heart.",

We weren't ready to start that chapter in our lives when we were planning on having children when we were 30-32, after having more life experience and traveling.\n\nI'm 26. It was the most devastating decision I have ever made in my life. I kept thinking, this is the age my mom had my brother and she turned out fine. Everyone I know is having children now and I felt selfish for making this decision at my age when people are trying to conceive. I cried every night for weeks, there was this overwhelming feeling of guilt that loomed over me every day. I felt guilty for moving on with my life and for having fun. I remember when I first took the pill, I kept saying sorry to my stomach on my drive to the Drs and on the way back. I listened to a podcast earlier today where woman were telling their stories on the aftermath of their abortion and something that caught my eye was that they said they were pro-choice and they felt guilty for feeling guilty about their decision since they made that choice. We chose to not move forward. And that hit me like a ton of bricks. I don't even feel like l'm able to feel this way because I consciously made this decision.\n\nI know that my partner is here for me and he's expressed that he's hurting as well but I can't help but feel alone in this situation. It feels like l'm the only one carrying this burden and that I have to act like everything is okay. I'm trying to move on but there's moments where my heart breaks all over again and I get even more upset with myself because want to just be normal. I feel more insecure about myself, like l'm a failure as a woman. I keep thinking that maybe if I had a higher income job I could have kept the baby and these thoughts create bigger insecurities towards myself and others. I'm comparing myself more and I keep thinking I'm not pretty enough, skinny enough, rich enough, good enough.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone ever felt this way after their abortion and how they coped? I've lived with depression and anxiety my whole life but I feel like l'm in a bigger hole than l've ever felt.\n\nThank you in advanced to those of you who\u2019ve gotten this far.",

Went and saw a doctor at a Christian hospital, she refused to abort which is understandable but then she told us that she wouldn't even do it at her private clinic and made very condescending remarks. She then referred us to another doctor who said the baby was at 14 weeks and she didn't want the hassle with the cops and so she refused too and referred us to another doctor who told us that we'd have to sign an affidavit with a lawyer stating that we're doing the abortion with our consent to prove that I haven't raped my girlfriend? (Who btw was there with me when he was saying all of this). He then told us it would cost around 40,000 INR which is way more than we could afford. Also, the hospital was really shady and we felt uncomfortable with how the doctor was behaving so we up and left. \n\nAfter struggling for a while and doing enormous research, thank fully, we found a place where they were willing to do the procedure for a lesser amount and they took good care of her and we were out in less than 5 hours and  now my girlfriend is recovering. \ud83e\udec0\n\nIf anyone else in Mumbai is facing issues with this, hit me up and I'd be happy to share the details because I wouldn't want y'all to go through what we went through. State safe and stay strong y'all. \u2764\ufe0f",

I went to a clinic yesterday under the impression I was fine to do a MA because last time I even bled was October 15th, when that occurred, it was only for like 2 days, and then I wasn't bleeding anymore. I considered it a cycle though. Especially because my periods are very much irregular and prior to the bleed, I hadn't had a period in about 2 months\n\nSo yesterday the Dr does the preliminary abdominal ultrasound, says he couldn't see anything, and needs to do a vaginal. From that he tells me I'm 11 weeks 6 days - over the legal limit of 11wks, so now I'm booked for an appt 2 weeks later, which will make me 14 weeks exactly. It's not adding up for me though. Could they possibly be wrong?\n\nAlso I kinda read up on some long term effects of a SA. Infertility if done incorrectly is a worry for me, because before this pregnancy, I always assumed I was infertile based off past experience with partners, not being on or using BC, and also having PCOS. Now that I've gotten pregnant, it's changed my view a little on wanting to have kids in the future. I guess what I'm asking for, are your experiences much later on with a SA? Are you experiencing complications? My mind is racing. Sorry if this is rambling, or all over the place.",

Doctor said everything went well but in the UK, checkups aren\u2019t really a thing you get unless you experience symptoms. It\u2019s advised that after 2/3 weeks you take a pregnancy test to make sure all the tissue is gone. I didn\u2019t take a test when I was meant to but started feeling a bit like I was pregnant the past couple of days. Cravings, headaches, fatigue, nausea. I just took a pregnancy test and it came up positive, faint, but positive. \n\nI was wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience. (I also got a copper coil put in after the procedure). \n\nGoing to call the doctor tomorrow but sort of in freak out mode currently.\n\nUPDATE:\nWent to the doctor today and they figured out that not all the tissue was removed during the abortion so that\u2019s why it was showing up positive.",

        "body": "Hi! So, on August i got assaulted and also got pregnant, couldn\u2019t tell anyone and started looking for ways to get an abortion which is illegal in my country. I managed to find a way, and got a surgical abortion. I kind of didn\u2019t have a choice but I wanted the pill since i was scared and I\u2019m young (19 yo), so I thought would be a little easily manageable, although now i think surgical abortions are more efficient and not that hard to deal with. My procedure was traumatic because I didn\u2019t have any type of numbing previous to it and I\u2019ve never been to a gynecologist, also was awake though the whole process. I didn\u2019t feel much pain from the suction or afterwards, i used hot pads to avoid severe pain and such, and also got prescribed ibuprofen for the possible cramps, antibiotics and contraception pills. I was at 5 weeks when i got the abortion but the prior 2 weeks or so i was pretty sick, i could barely eat without throwing up, so once i got it i tried to eat health and get my vitamins back which was oky at first ( I felt relieved and hungry and \u201cnormal\u201d), but the antibiotics kept making me sick so i was stuck at throwing up again and not eating of even drinking water ( i was throwing bile I guess) so I lost weight in all of that process. I overcame that situation and it\u2019s been almost 2 months and I haven\u2019t had my period or any bleeding since the little spotting after the procedure, i also didn\u2019t take the contraceptives because I don\u2019t be having sex ( since I\u2019m still processing all of that) and i already knew that contraceptives can delay your period, the period is not a real period, could cause nausea, and other so I didn\u2019t want to freak out with small things. But recently I\u2019ve noticed that my belly is bloated, which makes me scared on what it could be and no period. I also can\u2019t find any similar case and going to a health care provider wouldn\u2019t be so easy. Am I still pregnant? Did something go wrong? Am I just going back to my normal weight? Please someone help me because I don\u2019t think I could go thru all of that again or bear a child.\n\nP.s: I took a pregnancy test 4 weeks after the abortion and a faint line appeared.",

Endless thoughts, fears, questions, feelings.. I feel really panicked and dissociated. I feel scared and powerless.\n\nThere isnt much privacy back home at mom and dads, ill probably be living here again for a while. I dont currently have a job, as ive had to go on welfare payments recently due to mental health issues. I feel like such a loser, so small. \n \nI feel claustrophobic inside and claustrophobic even if i go outside. There is nothing for me to do but pace around and break down. Theres no relief or respite to be found. My body feels like its in shock, i feel sick. My life already was in really bad shape, struggling for many years, and now I dont see any way I can magically overcome this too at the same time. Ive never been able to overcome my problems, i dont believe i can do it. Theres so many things wrong with me, its so overwhelming about how can i possibly fix them. \n\nThank u for sharing those resources with me xxx i will look into them and get some extra support asap. Ive been rendered completely unable to function due to this, I cant function like a normal adult right now, I cant really help myself out of this it feels. Im trying to not think, but i cant stop these thoughts and feelings. \n\nI need some sort of saviour or guide to follow to get me out of this :-( \n\nI was really moved by your genuine care and kindness towards me and my crisis \u2665\ufe0f I feel trust in what you are saying, even if i cant feel it right now xxx  Thank u \u2665\ufe0f",

You are going through something incredibly difficult, and the person closest to you has betrayed and abandoned you. You don't deserve this pain, and I'm so heartbroken for you that you are experiencing it. But you're not alone. We see you. Many people in this subreddit have experienced the intersection of a difficult abortion, relationship problems, and mental health problems. These traumas multiply and echo into each other. But people who are experiencing them have value, are worthy of love and care. They can heal and rebuild. It might not feel like it right now, but you can have a beautiful future, and I want that for you.\n\nThese feelings of worthlessness will go away. When you're in a better place, you'll be able to see more clearly that it's not true that other women can be everything you couldn't be for him. Maybe it's true that there's someone out there who's a better match for him, but it's also true that there's someone who's a better match for you, who doesn't make you feel embarrassed and ashamed of anxiety and depression, which are normal problems that many of us struggle with and which don't make us unworthy of love.\n\nBut for now, how to get through this? You clearly need immediate help and support. I'd suggest telling your psychiatrist you're feeling this level of despair, and reaching out to a suicide hotline as soon as you can. If you're in the US, the [All-Options talkline](https://www.all-options.org/find-support/talkline/) might also be a good way to find someone to talk to about your abortion. From your post it wasn't super clear, but if the medical problems were issues with the fetus, there's also a [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/tfmr_support/) for those who had to terminate for medical reasons. And you're welcome to stay here and tell us more.\n\nWill be thinking of you. Sending lots of hugs.",

Hes done this twice before but i always knew we would get back together. But this time was different, this was very final. \n\nIm so traumatised about the abortion (i had to get it for medical issues). I feel so heartbroken and i cant take it. I saw the babies little heart beat on the ultrasound, saw his little feet. I could feel him moving around in my belly, and it was the most beautiful and amazing thing. I felt bonded to him. The process of a late term abortion is very grim and distressing, im completely traumatised. I also have lactating breasts, and it is reminding me of the heartbreak every day, i cant even look at my own body anymore without being triggered. The clinic gave me a card with his little footprints on it. They told me all the details about being 20 weeks pregnant, as well as how they do the abortion... They took him out of my womb and cremated him, all i can think of is his little hands and feet burning. They injected him with a substance that stopped his heart from beating. I keep thinking of me in the procedure room just crying and feeling him move around in my belly, and when i woke up from the anaesthetic, the baby was dead. My belly was still. I cant take this pain, this trauma. \n\nMy boyfriend left me the day after, it happened about 3 weeks ago. He was so cold about it, like it was nothing. Like i was nothing. I was crying and begging him not to leave me alone with this right now, because i wont survive this and im so scared. He push me away and said \"no i dont want this\". He told me i had to leave, i couldnt breathe, i was shaking and inconsolable. He was hostile and didnt comfort me, he was like a stranger, he wasnt even treating me like a friend. He was on his phone some of the time while i was crippled on the ground crying. He said he doesnt understand why im being like this, he said to get over it. He said when im gone he always feels better. He told me a hundred things he doesnt like about me, he said its just me, everything. All the things he said are playing over and over in my head. Things hes said in the past, our memories, songs, etc, and how he used to be towards me when we first got together. Flashes of the abortion keep tormenting me at the same time. \n\nI have had to move back to my parents. I have had depression and anxiety for a long time, i have been dysfunctional and let myself go, i dont have a job (im studying). I dont have any friends, i dont want to be around anyone anyway. I am alone. My self esteem and confidence are obliterated, all my insecurities and things i hate about myself, all the ways my depression and anxiety ruined the relationship, all the things he hates about me, have been now ripped to the surface of my mind, it just wont stop.\n\nI dont think i want to go on, because all that awaits me is darkness, at the worst time in my life. I dont want to do anything anymore, i dont care about anything, i cry all day and am terrified at nights. A million things playing over in my head and stabbing me in the heart over and over. I cant take this. \n\nIm already on a few different meds for my mental health and see a psychiatrist. Ive been doing this for years, it doesnt help how i am feeling right now. Nothing can help, i dont want to do anything, i cant even be alone without breaking down and feeling waves of darkness and trauma consume me. I cant stand looking at myself, all it reminds me of is everything he doesnt want. I feel old and that ill end up alone. I already struggle so much with my mental health. \n\nI feel trapped and suffocated. Panic attacks, grief. Everything reminds me of him.and the abortion. Im feeling like this, while he is carefree, feels better now im gone, and will start dating other girls and sleeping with them, checking them out, m thinking how much better they are than me, how much better he feels with them, he will be so much happier, and it will contrast even more how shit i am in his eyes. He will get back into porn again. Just so many things. Other girls will be all the things im not, and all the things he wants. I feel horrific thinking about it. He never wants me back. \n\nI feel so embarrassed, guilty, remorseful, ashamed, hatred, disgust towards myself. He saw me at my worst, he never got to see the non-depressed and non-anxious version of me. Ill never have another chance to show him. All he will know of me are these bad things. Im so embarrassed. \n\nI cant believe this nightmare is happening, its surreal. Im still in shock. I cant process the finality of it all. \n\nNothing means anything anymore, i have nothing to live for, i cant live with myself, i cant stand myself, i feel so worthless and broken. I dont care about meeting new people or dating, ill feel so much worse. No one will want me or love me for who i am anyway. I dont want to go through this ever again, i am going to stay single permanently. All i feel is his absence, and my babies absence. Im so alone. So many thoughts and feelings, i cant make it stop. I cant improve my life. All the things wrong with me are rubbed in my face everyday. \n\nThis is all i have to look forward to for a long time. I wish i had my baby in my belly still. This is going to kill me, i dont want to live anymore. I dont know what im supposed to do. \n\nPlease someone help me, please  make it stop \ud83d\udc94",

I am too young, and my boyfriend is currently incarcerated, the next day I found out I told my mom, and we scheduled an appointment, I am so glad my parents were supportive of me as well as my boyfriends, my mom and I had our ups and downs but we both understand why and worked through it. Monday was my appointment, she took a vaginal ultrasound and asked if I would like to see, I said yes. She asked if I was sure about my last period and I was. The doctor said the pregnancy was already leading to a miscarriage. Which in some way made me sad but also made the decision so much easier, It was nothing but a small dot. She guided me through how to take the pills and what symptoms I would have. She told me if my cramps were normally really bad that she could give me vicodin, I said yes. Later that day I took the first mifepristone. The next day I had to insert the 4 misoprostol as far as I could inside me. About 10 minutes later I had light cramping, I knew it would only get worse so I took the vicodin, then I started to get the worst and longest cramps of my life, I almost vomited. And went to the bathroom, my mom brought a heating pad and a pillow, I laid there groaning in pain for about 40 minutes, then the vicodin kicked in. I passed out on the floor for and hour, then finally went to the bathroom, and heard the blood clots come out, it was disgusting. I stayed on the floor for another hour, then had minimal cramping the rest of the night, but lots of bleeding. More passed throughout the night, and the next day now I have minimal bleeding and light cramps. Overall one of the most painful things i\u2019ve ever felt. But there is so much more relief I have as well of no morning sickness and sleepiness. And a wait off my shoulders.",

        "body": "I\u2019m 21 and found out I was pregnant 2 weeks ago. I\u2019m in college and have been with my boyfriend (22) for 2 years. We talked over our options but ultimately decided we could not support a child right now. I called a few days after i found out to schedule my appointment to get the pill. Leading up to the appointment I was VERY nervous so I went to the internet with any questions I had and to read other peoples experiences. 10/10 do not recommend doing this! All I read were horror stories about the abortion pill which made me even more nervous. So I would like to share my non horror story for those who are maybe like me and want to get an idea of what they might go through. \n\nThe day of my appointment I was nervous but knew everything would be ok. I went into the clinic and got checked in, they took my blood, did an ultrasound, and did vitals. I found out I was 7 weeks along. I then spoke to the dr and she gave me 800mg ibuprofen & promethazine prescription. I then took the first pill in office. The Dr said there would not be any side effects to the first pill but maybe a little spotting. I didn\u2019t have any side effects from the first pill until that night when I had cold sweats. I was instructed to take the next set of pills 24 hours after the first one. At 6:30 the next day I took the ibuprofen and promethazine (for nausea) I had eaten a small snack before this. I took the next set of pills at 7:00pm (misoprostol). I did not put them in my mouth and let them dissolve because I knew it would make me puke. I put the 4 pills up my vagina which is the other way you can take them. After about 30 minutes of inserting the pills I started having light cramps. About an hour in the cramps became painful. I felt like my stomach was very heavy and felt like I had to shit. I went to the bathroom to try but the cramps became very bad when i stood up. I threw up even though I had taken the anti nausea meds. I then didn\u2019t know what to do bc it was very painful so I sat in the shower with hot water. I got out and laid on the couch and felt like I was having contractions every 10 seconds (this was the worst part). after about 10 mins of this I finally felt a rush of blood. I ran to the bathroom and passed the tissue in the toilet I instantly felt SO much better. After passing the tissue I was completely fine just had a little back pain but nothing too bad. I went to bed after passing it. My experience was VERY quick, I was only in pain for an hour (8:00-9:00) then passed it and was completely fine. I think my experience was so quick because I put the pills up my vagina but i don\u2019t really know that just makes sense to me lol. I\u2019m still bleeding my not much anymore it\u2019s been a few days. I hope this helps people like me that are curious. My experience was not terrible like most you read on here. Comment if you have any questions!",

I ask this because I have really small fingers and am not sure if I can get the pills far enough. \n\nAlso, I have incredible anxiety over this. I\u2019ve never done this before and I will be by myself. Would it be ok to take a small dose of lorazepam (0.5 mg) to calm me down during this process? I don\u2019t want to interfere with the first/second drugs or the ibuprofen/ Dramamine.

I personally would recommend surgical, because you have that peace of mind that it's over', plus you're eligible for surgical since you're 8 weeks. it's 5 minutes, and it's more uncomfortable than painful, but that's my personal opinion. \n\nIf you do pills, plan to take a couple days off, due to cramping, possible nausea, all that fun stuff that comes with an extreme period pretty much. When you take the pills you have 2 options, oral, or vaginal, both have to sit in your system for a half hour. I heard the pills taste bad, so sitting for a half hour with 4 pills in my mouth was a no for me. If you do vsginal, you just insert them as far up as possible (I was told this method is more effective) and lay down for a half hour. After 3-4 hours you feel cramping, then you begin to pass clumps. They'll prescribe 800mg ibuprofen and anti nausea in case you need them too. \n\nPersonally, it feels like having a regular period, less like an abortion. I guess it's more intense the further along you are in pregnancy? However you have to wait 6 weeks before you take another test to confirm you're not pregnant, and there's a chance it can fail although it's rare. \n\nHope all goes well for you in whatever choice you make!

And have a friend or loved one with you if possible because it can be emotional at times. The surgical is over much quicker and like OP said you\u2019re under the care of medical professionals.

All I felt was a lot of pressure and some discomfort. The discomfort dissipated as soon as they removed the suction tool. At the worst part of the procedure I was only at a 5/10 on the pain scale. That 5/10 feeling only lasted for 30 seconds. When they removed the suction I immediately went down to a 1/10. After about 10 minutes it was a 0/10. And the recovery is a breeze, I was able to go back to normal activity immediately. There\u2019s only been slight bleeding with one day of passing clots. Cramps are very minimal, ibuprofen and heating pad makes them go away completely. Plus the nurses and doctor that were there with me were amazing, I felt so much better having them by my side and it was nice not to have to do it alone. \n\nI chose surgical over medical because logistically it was just better since I had to travel out of state and they were able to confirm it being successful before I even left the clinic. Didn\u2019t want to risk going home with pills and it not working and having to travel again. But I\u2019m so so glad it ended up that way, because after I experienced it and compared it to everything I\u2019ve read about the pill, I realized that it\u2019s absolutely the easier route physically (in my personal opinion at least). From what I\u2019ve read with the pills, you\u2019ll be in pretty bad crampy pain for at least a couple of hours. With surgical, if you experience bad pain it will be over within the span of 5 mins. But like I said, a lot of people don\u2019t even experience too much pain with the surgical anyways. \n\nAlso, planned parenthood has a financial aid program, I\u2019m not sure if you would qualify personally, but I was able to get my surgical abortion done completely for free through planned parenthood. They are amazing.\n\nETA: I see a lot of people saying that they were sedated through their SA and that\u2019s awesome, even more reason to potentially take that route if you want. But I just wanted to say that I wasn\u2019t sedated through mine (just numbed in my cervix area), and wanted to reassure you that it\u2019s totally possible to get through it without sedation and not feel too much pain still. But whatever you decide I\u2019m sure it will be the right decision for you! I have a post that goes in depth on how the procedure went in my post history if you\u2019d like to read it.

I went in fully prepared to just pick up the meds and then go experience the trauma at home, but then in the ultrasound the doctor was like oooh you\u2019re gonna have to do the SA. \n\nThe waiting on the day of the appointment (10 hours + 4 hours of commuting \ud83e\udd74) sucked but only because I live in a restricted state. It was still significantly shorter than the MA process would\u2019ve been. \n\nI did mild sedation with Ativan because my partner was available to drive me home, so still completely conscious just more relaxed. The procedure itself was very short probably 15 minutes max but I also had an embedded IUD they were trying to remove so it tacked on some time. It was very straight forward and they told me exactly what was happening (I asked for that). The pain itself was more \u201cuncomfortable\u201d than anything, waaaayyyy easier to handle than my IUD insertion was. The worst part was actually probably when they were tugging on my IUD (ended up having to get it removed surgically later). Plus they were gentle with me in a way that other doctors never had been before, both emotionally and physically. The clinic folks were also supportive and able to reassure me in ways that my partner\u2014somebody who\u2019d never had any type of experience with reproductive healthcare in the medical setting, let alone abortion procedures\u2014couldn\u2019t. \n\nAnd of course there was confirmation then and there that the termination was successful so I never had any anxiety about that aspect of it. The after effects were like a mild period with cramping and a little bit of spotting and a little bit of soreness but I think that was related to the IUD tugging. \n\nNo matter which route you choose, my heart is with you.

It\u2019s already a lot balancing 2 kids . I was terrified of 3 . You know last year when I was pregnant I thought I could handle 4 let alone just 2\u2026 now that I have 2 it\u2019s alot . I love being a mom I love being a stay at home but when will this chapter end right? I\u2019m officially ready to say okay let\u2019s focus on our girls now and live our life . I had my kids young .. I am growing up with them and I can\u2019t bring another in the picture and give everyone all my attention  shared it\u2019s just not possible I don\u2019t want my 10 month old to get the brunt of the stick because now I\u2019m dealing with another newborn\u2026 it\u2019s a lot to balance I give it to those super moms with 2+ kids . I just don\u2019t think I can give them the full quality life they deserve so I opted out. My fianc\u00e9 goes for a vasectomy soon it\u2019s the best decision for us. I was hurt about it I honestly didn\u2019t know what to feel but realistically everything gets more difficult my last pregnancy was hard I complained the whole time . I don\u2019t wanna put my body through that again . We would have to upgrade our vehicle and our place .. we have plans of travelling with our family and it\u2019s so much harder to do that with 3 kids let alone 2. It was a good decision for us I don\u2019t regret it. I\u2019d do it all over again if it happened again. I was hurt for a bit but then it went away because physically and mentally couldn\u2019t do it. My children deserve as much as I can give them and in our day and age I don\u2019t want to bring another child in this world I\u2019m already worried about what the future looks for them with how our world is right now. If in the near future when we have the white picket fence and a huge backyard and everything going well then I\u2019ll maybe look into adoption if I ever need the fulfillment of another little one . But right now this chapter is over . Do what is right for you. What can you handle? Is it gonna make life harder? Then do what you gotta do . Don\u2019t feel bad for it. We are human raising little humans and moulding them. Your hands are full. Don\u2019t feel guilty for a good decision that could be right for you.",

        "body": "Hey I\u2019m not sure where to start but recently I had an abortion about two weeks ago using the medication method. The process was very traumatizing for me emotionally and physically. Here\u2019s the backstory. On August 29th I found out my boyfriend (my first love) was cheating on me again and I decided to leave him for good. A week later I found he gave me and curable STI. A week after that I found out I was pregnant. At first I didn\u2019t want to keep my baby but then my feelings changed. I became happy that I was having a baby until I realized I am still in college away from family , I will be a single mom, and I am not financially ready. The feelings of being cheated on and betrayed also began to resurface. I don\u2019t want to go in to depth but he treated me horribly from the time we were together up until I had the abortion. He didn\u2019t even pay for it and he was not supportive at all like he said he would be. Today I am two weeks post procedure and while it has gotten easier to handle the emotional pain, I still think about my baby everyday and I suffer from grief. During the abortion I saw my baby in the toilet and that was one of the hardest things I have ever had to experience. In addition I have now been constantly seeing women happily announce their pregnancy on social media and I can\u2019t help to feel sad and resentful. I would have love to keep my baby but due to circumstances and the father being a complete jerk, I did not want to bring them into a situation that was not the best. These past few months have been very hard for me emotionally with the cheating,pregnancy, and abortion. My family has been by my side the whole time which I thank them for, but I still feel alone. The thought of him and how he treated me while I was pregnant is something I can\u2019t stop thinking about. I have anger towards him and how he will continue to live life just fine while I have been suffering for so long. I also hold a lingering pain in my heart from my baby no longer being with me. Any words of advice and encouragement would be appreciated.",

I was not allowed to eat or drink anything the night before and morning before.\n\nI was at the clinic for about 2 hours. It started by filling out some papers and signing some forms. Then soon after I was taken to a room to have my vitals taken. Then they performed a sonogram (it was not transvaginal). They asked if I wanted to see the embryo or have a picture and I declined. Then soon after I was taken to a different room where they gave me a painkiller and another medicine I believe was an antibiotic. Then I had to take my pants and underwear off, I put a cloth over me and then my feet in stirrups. There was a doctor, nurse, and my bf in the room. The doctor began but feeling my cervix and then they inserted a speculum. So far so good, no pain. Then they numbed my cervix a few times. That was an unpleasant pinch, probably a 4/10 on pain. It went away quickly. Then they dilated my cervix and that felt a little painful but not bad. \n\nAfter the dilation they started the vacuum. That was disturbing. If you have had a bad cramp, it felt just like that. But I was very uncomfortable and felt like I was going to poop and pee myself from pressure. The doctor vacuumed for probably less than a minute. I groaned in pain and I could feel my uterus pulsating. Once they took out the speculum I felt pretty good, but the entire thing but my body into like a shock. I went pale white and felt nauseous. I can assume this was the lack of food, water, and I had been experiencing a lot of nausea for being pregnant. I also got really hot and sweaty. Overall the pain was a 6.5/10 but it was extremely unpleasant. \n\nThen the doctor and nurse left to give me some time to recover. I just laid there trying not to feel so sick. After about 15 minutes I sat up and felt blood slide out of me. Then I felt even more sick. I threw up (not the pills, at least I didn't see them) and laid back down for longer. The nurse came back, gave me discharge instructions, checked vitals, and said I was free to leave whenever. I cleaned myself up, let more blood leak out, cleaned again, then put my pants and a pad on. I wobbled to the car and felt okay. No more pain but I did feel a bit funky. Eating helped that. \n\nIt's been about 8 hours since the procedure and I've been doing good. Minor cramping and bleeding. I just feel so relieved. I do feel some guilt, but I'm just here to tell you all about the physical process. I was glad to have to option of SA because I think MA would've been much more painful for a lot longer. \n\nI hope this helps someone. Remember, the pain doesn't last long. You have probably been through worse physical pain.",

Although I think maybe it\u2019s surgical only beyond 22 weeks. \n\nSo my experience: you take the 4 misop then 2 more every three hours. I had strong pain relief and just had to try sleep but couldn\u2019t really due to the contractions. At times I struggled to stand up/ sit down/ lie down and had to walk around hunched and the pain was real but I was kinda out of it because of the pain killers. I was also very sick. I had my first dose at 8:30am and didn\u2019t have any bleeding at all until 5pm when my water broke, it was all really fast from there and intense pain/ contractions but then the pregnancy was passed. I couldn\u2019t help but look even though they advise you not to and it honestly broke my heart. I haven\u2019t really been able to not think about it since. I then had to have an injection to help pass the placenta and then that happened super fast and then I was able to leave hospital after eating some food and walking around. The nurse I had was so so supportive and lovely that it made the whole thing so much easier as I was a complete wreck. I felt exhausted for 2 days after but then other than this severe breast pain I only have light bleeding and feel fine physically. You forget the physical pain of the procedure after so fast but I could never do that again unless there was serious reason. Had I not had the first earlier failed abortion and only found out at that later stage of the pregnancy I wouldn\u2019t have done it. The developmental risks and lack of studies done alongside the medical advise from the doctors made me go through the procedure again.",

In the week after my MA, I was feeling the same way as you, I experienced so many different emotions in that week that it felt like a month.. but as I was processing what I\u2019d just gone through and what I\u2019d done, I noticed that my brain kept trying to make the thoughts of me keeping the baby a fantasy almost. For example, my brain conveniently erased every single reason I made the decision in the first place from my thoughts surrounding \u201cif I had kept the baby\u201d what all of that would look like, it\u2019s like my mind had replaced reality with fantasy where everything would\u2019ve perfectly fallen into place and I would\u2019ve had my \u201cperfect child\u201d and been fulfilled and happy. It was only through talking it over with my mom that I was reminded what reality would\u2019ve been if I had kept it, and it wasn\u2019t good (just to keep my post short, I\u2019ll leave it at that). So, I do understand where you\u2019re coming from, there\u2019s so many emotions to process and it\u2019s okay to feel the way you do, be kind to yourself, you\u2019ve been through so much having to make such an extremely difficult decision. My advice is to process the grief, I wrote my almost little one a small letter and then got a necklace with their due date birth flower and I wear it everyday \ud83d\udc95. Allow yourself to process the grief, talk to a professional if you need to, and try not to let your mind create a fantasy of what could have been. I\u2019m willing to listen if you ever need to vent, I won\u2019t give any unwelcome advice \ud83d\ude0a. Hang in there, internet friend \ud83d\udc95 big hugs to you!",

We have steady careers and a good support system, but we are simply not ready to have children yet. The thought of starting this chapter of our lives right now filled us with dread and we decided to listen to those instincts. Some day, just not today. \n\nI received the medicine in the mail from Choix 5 days ago and decided I was going to take a sick day while my husband worked from home to help me throughout the day. \n\n9:45pm- I take a Zofran and the mifepristone tablet before bed. I plan to take the miso vaginally, so I can start that first thing in the morning. I woke up throughout the night tossing and turning. Could tell the medicine was doing something, but it didn\u2019t hurt- more just light full body tingles. Perhaps anxiety more than anything??\n\n8am- I set my \u201cout of office\u201d, drew the shades and turned on the tv in the bedroom, made enough room for my dogs on the bed (very important), plugged in my heat pad, and hubby set me up with a big ice water and some snacks for the day. I had a good anxiety cry with the fam and settled in. \n\n9am- i take an 800mg Ibuprofen and a 4mg Zofran to prepare for the miso. I decided to eat a bagel sandwich for breakfast because painkillers mess with my stomach, which has been very messed up now for 2 weeks due to pregnancy. Seemed to help.\n\n10am- took the misoprostol vaginally and sat in bed for 30 mins with no symptoms, then another hour with no symptoms. Decided to smoke a little marijuana in order to fall asleep for a while and ease the anxious anticipation. \n\n2pm- fully back awake with what I would describe as bad period pains, and I generally have very uncomfortable period cramps. They intensify quickly in waves and I relocate to the toilet to push some tissue and blood out. This was the worst of the cramps and they were a 8/10 on the pain/uncomfortable scale for someone who has really never had a significant medical procedure. Think of the worst gas or period cramp you\u2019ve ever had and hold it at the worst part for about 20-25 mins. I laid on the bathroom floor for a while to get cool and feel a small pop so I get back up and finally pass what I believe to be the fetus. \n\n3:30pm- another bad toilet-worthy cramp, about 7/10 and over in about 15 minutes. I pass just blood and start to feel more like myself around 4.\n\nIt\u2019s now 7pm and I\u2019m getting small waves of cramps, but I can walk around slowly with just some mild pain and bleeding. I feel very relieved to be past the worst and proud that I was strong enough to choose the path that was right for myself and my family right now. \n\nIf you\u2019re considering an MA, just know you can do it. You\u2019re allowed to be scared of the process and you\u2019re allowed to not enjoy it. Get yourself set up as best you can, reach out for support if you need it, and your body will handle the rest \u2764\ufe0f",

Then again, everybody has different pain tolerances\u2014 and different bodies. It all comes down to individual experience.\nBut in my experience, I was terrified until it actually happened.\nAt the clinic, I took mifepristone and waited 24 hours to insert the misoprostol. Within 30 minutes, I felt slight cramping, and I had taken 2 Tylenol (500 mg). \nAfter about 3 hours I started bleeding, and it just felt like a normal period. Yes I was cramping, and some cramps hurt, just like how periods hurt. And there was an excess amount of clots being passed in my pad but I was OKAY. \nThis whole time , I was cuddled up on the couch watching Netflix. \nSo for anybody out there who is afraid, I promise it is okay! All it takes is some self care, courage, and don\u2019t be afraid to dose up on the Tylenol.\nSending my love <3",

He gets to feel the way he feels, but he doesn't get to punish and manipulate you to get what he wants.\n\nYou have made a hard decision that shows an enormous amount of strength and self-awareness. I wish you much love and happiness in your future!",

I had an abortion two days ago when I was nearly 15 weeks. I had known I was pregnant for a couple weeks before I decided to terminate the pregnancy. For reference I am 20 years old and in university, also I was dating the \u2018father\u2019 for a couple months prior to the pregnancy. When I found out, my then bf insisted that I keep the pregnancy. He dropped out of high school but somehow managed to get a decent job. He promised to support us and insisted that I keep it because he suffered from depression and needed to feel happy. I wanted to terminate s the pregnancy since I have dreams and aspirations and I really want to finish my degree. Also I honestly didn\u2019t love the \u2018father\u2019 and I wanted to break up with him. When I told my parents they helped me arrange a termination and insisted that I stop contacting the man who impregnated me. I was so relieved but I received a message from him saying I was a selfish c*nt and I ruined his life. I feel so guilty and horrible. I guess I just want someone to let me know if I did the right thing??",

I'm sure you'll do great! it's a super quick procedure, especially at 7 weeks. sometimes the patients at my clinic spend longer waiting for the doctor to come in the operating room then the actual procedure itself takes.",

The start of my last menstrual period was on 03-Oct and the procedure will be on 21-Nov, so I\u2019ll be 7 weeks on the day. \n\nHow likely is it that something will show up on the ultrasound? I\u2019m so worried they\u2019ll turn me away and reschedule me to another day if nothing can be seen.\n\nAlso, I read that an ultrasound is performed before the procedure to determine gestation and viability, but what exactly are they looking for? For gestation, are they checking for the age of the fetus, gestational sac, yolk sac, and fetal pole? For viability, are they looking for a heart beat?",

I smoked and drank coffee before but coffee tasted literally like vomit and the smell of cigarettes was unbearably disgusting. my boyfriend would come in from the balcony and i could smell that he was smoking and it was awful to be to close to him. Also i was a lot just laying in bed not motivated to do anything. I really really hated it and could not imagine going though this for more 6 months. \nAdditionaly i had like almost 2 weeks of that urge to vomit but i hadnt have to. I always kinda thought pregnancy wasnt like in the movies but it totally was for me. I talked to other woman in the meantime and apparantly a lot hadnt any trouble with their pregnancy like i had so i guess it really varies. \n\nI like to think that my body didnt want it since i did not want the child nor did my significant other. \nI actually never saw a picture of my baby and the several doctors i visited either asked If i wanted to see it or knew about my decision and did not show me without asking. \nfriends told me that i might have changed my mind if i would have been seeing his/her beating heart.\n\nthis story is actually from germany so there where no legally difficulties. I am really glad that i actually had a choice and i dont regret my decision but its crazy to think that i could have gave birth this month if i wanted to. \nFurthemore im financially unstable still and i would like to have a debtfree life before giving birth.

Since then we've had 3 miscarriages and have struggled to get pregnant inbetween them all. This year in August I finally got double lines and we making it past dates that we hadn't before, ticking off the dreaded 13 weeks. We told the world about our rainbow baby and then we had troubles at the 20 weeks scan, we were told they just couldn't see anything and we should just go to a specialist to get a good look at bubs.\n\nWe thought nothing of it and honestly I was distracted with my mum being in the ICU, on the 6th of November, my mum passed away and I thought that I couldn't get any more bad news but four days later we had our specialist scan \n\nAt our scan we were told our little miracle baby had an extremely rare heart defect called hyperplastic left heart syndrome and had very little chance of survival even with surgery, as overall, it has no cure. After weeks of questions we came to the terrible decision of saying goodbye to our much wanted baby.\n\nLast week, I had to bury my mum and give birth to my stillborn son. \n\nI know grief does crazy things but I keep getting this overwhelming feeling that a baby needs me and catch myself looking for him; it's like my body and mind are reaching out desperately to hold my son but will never be able to. My question is if this is something people normally feel?\n\nI have a therapist appointment this week but just wanted some answers from people who have had to make the difficult choice of termination.\n\nTLDR: I terminated my baby and my body feels like it's desperately searching for him to hold; is this normal?",

It sounds like you're pretty sure of your choice, as you've outlined many good reasons why you planned the abortion in your post here. It's normal to be completely sure of an abortion and still think through some of those \"what-ifs\" or feel sad that this wasn't quite the right time for you to become a parent. Remember, going through with the pregnancy doesn't necessarily mean that it will be enjoyable, especially if you're unsure of whether now is a good time to be pregnant and then a parent. If it's your first abortion, you might also be experiencing some nerves about a new medical thing that's making your feelings murkier. If what I'm saying here resonates with you, I'd recommend just trying to get some rest tonight as best as you can. You'll get through tomorrow by remembering it's okay to have some of those \"what if?\" feelings but reminding yourself that you're confident in your decision and looking forward to a time where you can fully enjoy a pregnancy.\n\nThat said, if you feel very seriously on the fence or doubtful, perhaps try some exercises in the [Pregnancy Options Workbook](https://www.pregnancyoptions.info/pregnancy-options-workbook) this evening; it's designed to help pregnant people make a choice about the outcome of their pregnancy and can really be helpful.

It all seems so sketchy, sadly, thanks to the current climate. Does anyone know of a \\*trustworthy\\* company that sells abortion pills affordably? Extorting hundreds out of women who need this makes me sick. I have health insurance and an HSA account, and I know those pills' real value isn't worth the hundreds some are trying to ask for ($400+ was the highest I saw. The others were asking for $150+ to be paid by insecure means like Zelle, where I couldn't get my money back if they default on their end of the agreement). Thank you in advance.

              "body": "What kind of support do you have for your anxiety?  What are some strategies that help you?  I don't want to start to comfort you but do it in the wrong way.  I do want you to know that you are MORE THAN strong enough to feel all your feelings, both physical and emotional, when you're going through this MA.  \n\nHave you ever tried vagus nerve work?  Google it and try a few of the methods for calming your nervous system PHYSICALLY.  Things like humming, looking all the way over one shoulder, then the other, tapping your breastbone, massaging your gut.  You absolutely want to be extending your exhale if you're feeling anxious and breathing only through the nose. \n\nAnxiety is avoidance of the hardship you're in through illusion of control.  It's an escape route out of the present moment.  So if your response to pain or blood is \"GET ME OUT OF HERE!\" then Anxiety will HAPPILY step up and give you a way out.  Conversely, as soon as you're actually willing to be 100% IN the present moment of pain or blood or hardship without trying to control it or escape from it, anxiety will dissipate.  It is not needed if you're willing to be present.  This method  WORKS but it takes practice, time, trust.  I can't promise that you would be able to turn it on for the very first time when under duress.  That's why I recommend vagus work.  We can get at safety signals in the body without having to change mental habits.  It's easier. \n\nThe word \"surrender\" is extremely important to me when I'm in labor (and I consider MA an induced labor of miscarriage).  As far as your cervix, pelvis, and vagina are concerned, MA is NO BIG DEAL compared to laboring a birth, because they don't have to accomodate a full sized baby.  But as far as your uterus is concerned, a contraction is a contraction and so this part is very much like laboring at any stage.  If you've experienced bad period cramps, as I did when I was a teen, this will feel familiar.  It's physically intense.  And yeah, it hurts.  One thing that helps me when I'm in such intense sensation is to really understand that my body was built for it.  That I'm not in danger, I'm just in an intense moment, and this moment will end, but I'm right here now, so it's time to let my body do what it needs to do.  I experience this kind of pain FIRST as effort and SECOND as pain.  Have some curiosity and see if you can tease out the effort from the pain.  It might shift things for you. \n\nI used to regularly experience anxiety attacks before my abortion and I don't anymore.  The hardship that led to my abortion was extreme.  The sheer levels of catastrophe and fear re-calibrated my entire system.  Your MA may not be a worst-case scenario, and it may not be scary (but your anxiety is telling you it will be).  For many, many women, abortion is really not such a big deal.  But mine was.  And what I learned from that is that worst case scenario hardship can actually be transformative in a good and beautiful way.  Ten years since my loss, and I have not had one anxiety attack in this decade.  \n\nWould it help at all to re-imagine this MA as a rite of passage? \n\nIt's also 100% ok to be like: No way, Kate.  That would not help.  I want this to be as easy as possible.  I want to be fully distracted from any and all pain.  And if that's your desire, I wish you the easiest possible experience. \n\nEither way, super-easy or break-your-soul-wide-open-hard, this is finite.  It will be over soon.  You deserve to live the life you want to live without being beholden to an unintended pregnancy.  I hope your OB does provide this vital service so you don't have to run around looking for other options.  ALL OBs should do this.  I don't see GYNs who aren't abortion providers anymore.  Doesn't feel safe.  But as I mentioned, my journey has been a pretty extreme one. \n\nWishing you the best.  Check out vagus work and learn a few tricks.  It can't hurt.  You are plenty strong enough to have an MA and live a good life after it. When it's all over, maybe check out neurofeedback for your anxiety.  It's a modality I like for this problem.",

              "body": "Okay. I just completed a medical abortion today. I was also absolutely terrified about the pain, the clots, the taste, everything.\n\nSo I'll go over this with you and be as honest as I can about everything. \n\nI was 8 weeks, my fetus was a little bit bigger than a large pea. I was so scared, I had to hold my partner's hand to even get the medication in my mouth. He brought one of our cats in and we cuddled for a bit until I was ready. \n\nThirty minutes passed, the pain was supposed to come 2 to 4 hours after I took the medication, but it instead came instantaneously. I'd been having very painful cramps even before the MA, so I thought it was that.\n\nIt wasn't. The pain from the MA was instant. I felt like I had to poop, I sat on the toilet and cried for awhile. The pain kept ramping up and getting worse and worse. I wound up at first on the bathroom floor curled in a ball sobbing. Then I managed to move to my bed, where I cried and screamed so loudly my partner could hear me in the living room. It was constant pain for 45 minutes that just kept getting worse. The only thing that kept me sane was squeezing a stress ball, I was literally trying to break the thing with all my might, squeezing it, pushing on it, pulling it apart. My partner sat on the end of the bed with me while I screamed, he tried to hold me but I begged him not to touch me. He asked me if I wanted to be alone, I said I didn't know. He sat with me for the entire 45 minutes. I rolled around, I tried to massage my pelvis, some things helped slightly, but only gave minor relief.\n\nThen the pain suddenly stopped. I laid on the bed panting. The relief of being painless was enough to make me cry. Fifteen seconds later, the pain came back worse than before. I screamed into a pillow. Thirty seconds later, the pain was gone again. This pattern went on for an hour, I counted my contractions to keep myself sane, I had a timer on my phone that I just watched go higher and higher and higher. I knew the higher the number went, the closer I was to being done with the pain. I cried to my partner multiple times, \"I want it to stop. Please, please make it stop. I want this to STOP!\" \n\nHe left the room after a few minutes and came back to put my favorite anime on. During the few seconds of relief I had, I enjoyed my show. He left me alone after a while. There was nothing more he could do. It sounds crazy, but I knew that if I had just those few seconds of relief, I could get through it. The constant pain was far, far worse than the contractions. \n\nAfter an hour and 40 minutes, the contractions were farther apart and the pain spikes were less painful. Until, I had no more pain but a dull ache. I bled just a little bit at this point. I got up, I paced around and drank some water. My partner checked on me and continued to check on me every 20 to 30 minutes. \n\nAn hour went by with no pain. And then, the pain came back. It was contraction style again, not quite as bad as before. But still bad. I was tired of screaming, my throat hurt. Instead, I squeezed my blankets and my bedding as hard as I could. I counted my contractions again, my count was always off, I would move from 49 to 30, but the point of counting wasn't to keep accurate check, it was to give me an increment that would let me know how far I'd come.\n\nAnother 40 minutes passed. And then the pain went away. I started bleeding profusely. The clots didn't feel like anything much, very similar to how inserting something into your vaginal cavity feels but reversed, coming out instead of going in. It didn't hurt, it wasn't uncomfortable. Mine was almost entirely wet clots with little actual blood. There were minor cramps here and there. Whenever I felt cramped up like that, I would sit on the toilet and pass more clots. \n\nAnd that's how it's been going for the past several hours.\n\nI will say my MA has been very unusual for many reasons, I know it's different for everyone. For one, it shouldn't have started instantly like that. I also think mine may have been more on the high pain side of the spectrum, many people here said they slept through theirs. I can't imagine sleeping through that amount of pain.\n\nI'm not sure if I would choose this option again. I know in-clinic abortions also hurt a bit with cramping, but they try to make you comfortable and can offer pain relief while you're there. On the other hand though, I'm a survivor of domestic abuse, and I don't handle being vulnerable well, especially not in public. It was nice being at home with my partner and my cats, in my bed where I could move all I wanted and shamelessly scream into my pillows without worrying about what the medical staff was thinking. It was also much easier on my partner because he didn't have to sit in a hospital room for hours, he could come and check on me then go back to what he was doing.\n\nI know none of this is going to make you feel better and I'm sorry for that. But that was my experience with a MA.",

I did it at night so that I had an excuse to avoid everyone in the house (except my boyfriend lol) and have an entire day after to recoup.\n\nThe only downside of that is I soaked through the pad I slept through the night in and it got on my sheets a little, but I had meant to put down a towel. It would have been fine, otherwise.\n\nI'm so glad this helped. Reading real experiences helped me a lot, too. The \"facts\" on medical websites just terrified me. It was not as bad as I had anticipated at all, just be ready for some pretty heavy cramps within the first few hours after taking the second days pills.

I passed out just listening to the doctor explain how they were going to put my IUD in (I obviously did not follow through). My main point, I hate thinking about and participating in any medical procedure and I hate feeling unwell.\n\nI have a lot of anxiety when it comes to these things and when I found out I was pregnant I knew I couldn't keep it...and I had a breakdown. I didn't think I could handle a medical or surgical abortion. Being pregnant, even in the early weeks, sucked. I was nauseous, throwing up, breaking out. I couldn't bring myself to make it to my appointment with Planned Parenthood because 1. their next appointment was in two weeks and I didn't want to wait and 2. I wouldn't be allowed to have a support person due to continued COVID restrictions, so I would certainly pass out just talking about the procedures or breakdown having to look at the ultrasound.\n\nI went with AidAccess. It was quick, easy, and effective. I took the first pill and went on my day normally and felt perfectly fine. I was dreading the next day. My boyfriend and I laid down and I let the second set of pills dissolve in my mouth. Cramps started pretty quickly and within 20 minutes they were intense. It was bad. The worst cramps I've had, but, looking back, I could do it again and definitely prefer that over a day long hangover (but I get bad hangovers lol). I pooped. A lot. I got in the shower after a 20 minutes of sitting in the bathroom. I laid in there with my boyfriend for a while and started bleeding. I barely felt anything while letting the hot water hit my stomach. We then laid down and I bled a lot. I took the pills pretty late, at 8 PM. I had a tossing and turning night of sleep but we watched Dash & Lily (the most comforting holiday show to watch while having an abortion) and I felt comfortable, especially with my heating pad. I took ibuprofen every 4 hours. I drank a lot of water. I changed my pad twice that night, soaking through one because I fell asleep. When I woke up and sat on the toilet I felt the clumps come out. Big clumps that I didn't look at because I knew I'd get nauseous, but it was relieving to know it worked. I was only 6 weeks. I felt almost normal the day after taking the pills. Very light cramping the next day and lighter bleeding. No morning sickness or crazy hunger or crazy attitude. I feel like me and...I didn't pass out! No anxiety attacks. Nothing. It was much easier than I thought.\n\nMoral of the story...if I can do it, you probably can too. Every experience is different because every body is different, but I hope this helps you ease your anxieties.",

I'm seeing several abortion clinics in Brisbane from a Google search. I would start by calling around and you can explain that you're an international student. They may be able to assist you in paying for it.",

This can be similar to or quite a bit more intense than a typical period. People also often experience diarrhea and nausea. \n\nTaking 3-4 pills (200mg) of ibuprofen every 6-8 hours can really help. Eating light snacks (like crackers) and drinking lots of water are good ideas for the nausea. Some people also take Benadryl or Dramamine for the nausea.

However, I\u2019ve also heard of plenty of women hiding at home abortions, by saying they\u2019re sick, that they have a bad period, if that\u2019s not out of the norm for you etc. It\u2019s obvi easier if you have your own space/combined bath, but it can be done. Take a look at heyjane.. idk exactly what it costs but I do know they have a sliding scale, accept some insurance and work with people to get funding. You also get the added benefit of having nurses and doctors virtually on-call if you do have any fears, symptoms or just need some support. \n\nRegardless of whether you go with them, I do hope you have a support system in place; if not family, then friends. You may not end up needing one; for some women it\u2019s nbd and for some women it can be a bit traumatic (and both reactions are absolutely fine and normal).

        "body": "I\u2019ve done nothing but peruse this subreddit since I found out I was pregnant. Just for some advice on what to expect / how I would feel etc. I decided to write about my experience going through a MA in case there\u2019s others like me that can\u2019t settle without knowing exactly what\u2019s going to happen / how you could feel etc. I hope this helps you \u2764\ufe0f\n\nSo it\u2019s been a bit of a pain getting this sorted, I was very early into my pregnancy which made it difficult for them to see via a vaginal ultrasound (check my post history for how that was) A week later I went to my appointment for my second vaginal ultrasound which went very smoothly, they were able to determine that I\u2019m 5 weeks and 6 days along. I asked for codeine which they were happy to give. They prescribed me the pills, popped them in a brown paper bag with a leaflet and I went home. \n\n1st pill (you swallow this one) - An absolute breeze, no nausea or anything like that. A bit of acid reflux but I\u2019ve had that for a while anyway so it didn\u2019t bother me too much. \n\n2nd pills - I opted to insert these vaginally as I heard through mouth they can cause nausea. Beforehand I ate, had a shower, took some codeine, got comfy with pads on and loose clothes then inserted the pills. It took about half an hour to feel the pain, I didn\u2019t have blood up until an hour or so afterwards. \n\nI\u2019m not going to sugar coat it, it fucking hurts. The pain made me nauseous at times but luckily I didn\u2019t vomit. I did lose my appetite and felt a bit gassy. I luckily had my partner with me who kept on top of codeine & ibuprofen etc, even with the medicine though it still did hurt and I found myself on all fours panting through the pain. \n\nI started passing blood clots then fleshy hard looking bits, I don\u2019t know what they were but I stopped checking when I wiped after that because it made me queasy / worried. I found that sitting on the toilet when the pain became really bad was a relief, I\u2019d try to pee and feel some blood etc come out. After that the cramps would ease up for a bit. \n\nI managed to fall asleep after taking more codeine and the day after was so much better. I did still have some cramping but it basically just felt like a heavy period. I did notice I was *super* gassy, but tbh I\u2019d take that over the pain any day. \n\nIt\u2019s now been 3 weeks since I had the abortion, I just took the test they give you to confirm the pregnancy has been terminated. \n\nThings I recommend - \n\n- Get that codeine that\u2019s available!!!! Even if you think you won\u2019t need it, it\u2019s better to be prepared for the worst. \n- Prepare beforehand - comfy pjs, a shower, food, support, hot water bottles, water, electrolyte drinks etc.\n- Nap whenever you can. Sleep goes out the window with this, it doesn\u2019t matter if you fuck up your sleep schedule. The pain can physically exhaust you so taking naps really helped. \n- If the pain becomes bad go sit on the toilet, this could help pass some clots etc which could make the pain lessen. \n- Have hot water bottles / hot pads on your back and belly (I won\u2019t lie, putting the hot water bottle above my vagina also felt good) then also a fan on you because you\u2019ll get hot.\n\nI really do hope this has helped a little. Remember though everyone is different and your experience could differ completely to mine. Just make sure you\u2019re properly supported and safe throughout this. \n\nI also don\u2019t mind answering some questions you might have, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s gross or graphic. I wish I could have asked stuff before I went through this so feel free to ask away! \u2665\ufe0f",

I know that feeling...that \"what if? I could've made it work...\" feeling. It sucks. It hurts. But you thought about it, you considered your options, and you made the choice that was right for you and your babies. So often the right choices are the most difficult, the ones that hurt the most.\n\nWhat I don't think people talk about enough (or at least I didn't know about it and wasn't prepared for it) is that you can know you made the right choice and not regret your choice, but still suffer the intense grief of losing your babies. That grief is real. It is mourning. And you need to let yourself mourn - be gentle with yourself. If it helps, memorialize your babies is some way that helps you. It also seems to me another burden that gets in the way of proper grieving is that secrecy around abortions and around the sorrow and pain and loss feelings that come with it. I know I am just an anonymous voice on the internet, but I am here for you. I support your pain and grief and mourning.  Those are valid emotions and you have the right to grieve for your lost babies the way any other mother grieves her lost children.\n\nI am also so sorry to hear that you are so alone - I also empathize with you there. It makes it even harder without support and comfort and love from people to help you carry your pain. I wish I could help you in that way, but I hope that my words can convey to you that I hear you and understand you and support you.\n\nSending you care and love and comfort and support (and if you ever want to DM me to vent or chat, please do :))",

I don\u2019t know what the right thing is   \nin this situation???\n\nI really feel this. What if you don't have to know.  What if there are plenty of reasons to believe that this was too much for your stage of life, but also, you only get to know the path you choose to take, you never get to compare to the alternative, because we can only live one single life at a time.  So you will never know for sure if this was the right choice.\n\nYou are a wise and loving woman and you made a kind and good decision  Could the other decision have been kind and good too?  Maybe.  It's ok not to know.  It's ok to work on loving yourself exactly where you are.  This doesn't mean you have to convince yourself you made the \"right\" choice.  It means you have to make room for all your feelings to be allowed.  If you can learn to love each feeling you have as tenderly as you clearly love your twins, it doesn't matter if the feelings tell you confusing stories.  It's enough just to love all parts of yourself, one by one, no matter what they're saying. \n\nYou have experienced a loss, and it's ok to grieve what you're missing even if you know it would have been hard -- perhaps TOO hard.  It's ok not to know. \n\nBecause of the nature of my own abortion, I spend a lot of time in TFMR space.  Every time I hear about a twin pregnancy, it doesn't sound fun and hopeful to me.  It sounds really scary and risky.  What-could-have-been are all sorts of terrible hardships the uninitiated never have to think about.  Twin to twin transfusion.  Selective reduction.  Premature rupture of membranes.  There's good reason that twin pregnancies are categorized high-risk.  Things go sideways in these pregnancies often.  I can't tell you how many stillbirth mamas there are at my in person loss group who lost twins.  A huge proportion of the babylost population is twin-loss. \n\nWe can't know what would have been if you continued this pregnancy.  Maybe it would have been perfect.  Maybe your twins would have been healthy and support would have come together. But your instincts showed you important risks (The Turnaway Study shows that women's instincts tend to be right on!)   And then there are other risks you didn't even know to worry about.  Maybe one of those hard paths would have been yours instead.  We can't know. \n\nYou are SO allowed to miss the idealized twin experience.  And perhaps what you are missing is actually a worse nightmare.  We can't ever know.  But I trust your instincts.  \n\nHolding you so gently with so much love and trust until you are ready to trust and love yourself completely. You deserve nothing less.",

        "body": "I was pregnant. With twins too. Two little lives chose me to be their mommy. Two little lives chose me, at once. Two little lives. Two little humans shared the space inside of me. Two little ones, at the same time. \n\nI was in transit to Thailand. I knew I was pregnant. I was going to keep the baby until I learned the daddy didn\u2019t want the baby. Until I learned the daddy wouldn\u2019t help with the baby. \n\nI was okay with the idea of being a single mother until I was faced with the reality. I was raised by a single mother and my grandparents. I was raised with love in the form of being cared for physically, being taken care of. I turned out okay so I was okay with the idea of bringing a life into the world the same way. Until I was faced with reality. \n\nReality: living in Thailand, no emergency savings, no secure job or future, no stability, no support, no father in the picture, not married, not in a relationship, not cared for by the father, alone, alone, alone, alone.\n\nI thought I was okay with being a single mother. I thought I was okay with raising a child on my own until I saw reality. \n\nI was in Thailand and went to get an abortion. I was still on the fence about it but i went anyway. The ultrasound showed that I was 9weeks pregnant with two babies. Two lives at once. Two lives in me at the same time. Two lives. I left without getting an abortion. I was okay with the idea of being a single mother until reality hit me. \n\nReality: living in Thailand temporarily, no emergency savings, no secure job or future, no stability, no support, no father in the picture, not married, not in a relationship, not cared for by the father, alone, alone, alone, alone. Pregnant with two kids not one. \n\nWhen reality hit me, it hurt. It hurt so bad. It hurt so much I was sick. It hurt so much I was numb. It hurt so much that it still hurts. When reality hit me, I cried. And I cried and I cried and I cried. See, I have always wanted to be a mother. More importantly I have always wanted to be a mother to twins. And crazy enough I have always wanted twins first, as my first pregnancy. \n\nReality hit me so hard that I had to change my own dream. I could not afford one baby, so I definitely could not afford two. Two little lives. The two little lives that chose me. I had no stability in my life, no support. Also, pregnant with twins in a foreign country? Terrifying. What if I was put on bed rest and couldn\u2019t work? What if I had a difficult pregnancy and needed support? What if I had to spend my days in the hospital being cared for by people who spoke little to none of the same language? What if? What if? What if?\n\nWhat if I have an abortion? \n\nWhat if I do the thing I said I would never do? What if I change my dreams from wanting to be a mother of twins to not? What if I change my life with this one pivotal decision?\n\nSo I did it. I had the abortion. I gave up my twins. My two little lives. It hurt so much. It hurts so much. Everyday I wonder. Everyday I have to tell myself that I did the right thing for those two little lives. Everyday I have to tell myself that I did the right thing for my life. Everyday. Every. Single. Day. It\u2019s been a month. A month since I\u2019ve made this lives changing decision. A month since I made the choice to give up my twins. To stop those two little lives from continuing. I would be 14 weeks pregnant today, just entering my second trimester. The twins would be the size of an orange and the weight of a peach. They would be using their facial muscles and their brain impulses would have started to fire. \n\nI was pregnant years before, like 7 years ago. I had a miscarriage. Initially I wanted an abortion. I was 19, still in college, in a long distance relationship, still a child learning and growing in the world. In fact, I went to get an abortion. But I was told that my iron levels were too low and that I needed to get em up and come back. I never went back. It took so much courage for me to go the first time that I was discouraged when they turned me away (even though I totally get it). So I decided to keep the baby and become a mom. I started thinking of possible names, where the nursery was going to be, what baby things I needed to buy. I had a miscarriage two months in. I was mad, I was hurt, crushed, I was devastated.  I felt like god stole that baby from me. Eventually, I convinced myself that it wasn\u2019t the right time and god was saving me from having to make the choice of having an abortion (even tho I already changed my mind and wanted to keep the child). Whatever to keep me sane. Whatever to keep me going. \n\nI made the choice this time. Took my two little babies. And now I am telling myself that I made the right choice to keep me sane. Im telling myself that I did the right thing to make it through my day.  Because in all honesty: I don\u2019t fucking know. I don\u2019t know if I made the right choice. I don\u2019t know if I did the right thing???? I don\u2019t know what the right thing is in this situation??? in my mind I still think that I could have done it. I still think that I could be pregnant with twins in a foreign country. I still think that I could have raised twins on my own. I know that I am capable of hard things. So I think that I know that I could have done this hard thing of motherhood of two alone but I don\u2019t know. i don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I. Don\u2019t. Know. \n\nSo because I have already made my choice and there is no going back and changing it, I am telling myself that I did the right thing. Whatever that fucking means. I am telling myself that I made the best choice I could have made. Because I did. I did the best with what I was given when I was given it. Even though it doesn\u2019t always feel like it. \n\n\n\nTL;DR found out I was pregnant with twins which I\u2019ve always wanted. Not in a stable place physically or financially to afford and care for the twins, so I got an abortion. still struggling with the reality a month later. Telling myself I did the right thing to keep me sane.",

To know that it was also on his mind as it was on my mind (the possibilities), he just didn\u2019t want to share his thoughts as the decision was mine at the end of the day made me feel better. He also reassured me that he loved me very much and he can\u2019t wait for the day we do have children (are ready for it in a few years). I don\u2019t know, this conversation did it for me.

And i love his sister , she is my good friend and a really nice person.

I was about done with this nightmare. My 3.5 year old was going to start preschool this next school year. He still poops in diapers and wont potty train he is wicked stubborn. He stays awake all hours of the night jumping and bouncing... he is very hard to handle. To have him go to preschool next year was a miracle I've been working so hard on trying to get him out of diapers to make it happen. My 18 month old is a sweetheart he is so chill and precious but its the 3.5 year old who gives me a very hard time. I can't handle anything else right now I can't even handle a house plant it would die under my watch. I can't even cook or take a poop without someone watching them. It is total prison lock down in a room all day with them going insane. I can't buckle them into their car seats and drive some place the 3.5 year old tantrums I can't sit the 18 month old down. It is a nightmare I was about done. I have to get this abortion. I understand you and you need to do this for you. LIE and say you had a miscarriage!",

With abortions being so shamed by society, that community care and support isn't usually there. It's similar to the juxtaposition of community care if let's say your child died of cancer but not if they died by suicide.

It 100% drains you mentally, emotionally, and physically. Being a SAHM is so hard to do when you're not in the mindset to do it or have no desire to do it. I was a SAHM for a year with my son and that year was so dark and I was at an all time low. Very depressed and hopeless. Living with my parents in a new state with no way to get child care assistance so no way to work. I am now 28 with an apartment of my own, my dog back with me, a car, and a job. \n\n\nThen I got pregnant from a fwb. I was in no way ready for another child. I couldn't see myself with a another child right then, with that guy. I didn't want another situation where I just have to raise the kid alone and depleted. I'm still working on getting mentally and physically healthy from my first pregnancy 6 years ago. I had already made up my mind. I didn't tell my parents. Still haven't and it's been almost a year. Probably never will. It's not their business and it'll only cause problems. \n\n\nI talked to my close friends and my sister who I knew would support me despite their opinions (some are anti-choice). They all respected me and supported my decision and were their for me. I told my fwb about the pregnancy. I had already told him when we started our situation that if I got pregnant, I was more inclined to terminate. He understood and he supported my choice. \n\n\nI went the abortion pill route and had it done at home. It was emotional but I had done all my thinking and even writing a pros/cons list. It helped clear my mind from any possible regrets. It's almost a year later and I don't regret it. I think about what the baby might have been like but I know I made the best choice for my son, myself and any future babies I may have. I gave myself the chance to better myself and get healthy so I have more to give later on. \n\n\nYour parents may disapprove but they're not the ones that have to go through being pregnant and raising a child plus the two you already have. If you are even headed about the abortion and know you can't handle another baby rn, then you don't have to listen to anyone else. You don't need a reason other than you don't want to. You and your boyfriend are on the same level with that right now and that's amazing. \n\n \nI just wanted to share my story because ours seemed similar to me. I hope you're able to do what you think is best for you. \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n \nEdit: an abortion could mess you up mentally, anything can. What I did when I found out I was pregnant was...\n\n...go to a abortion support clinic and talk about it beforehand\n\n...talk to close, supportive friends\n\n...write about how I felt about the pregnancy and the abortion (all the good, bad, and ugly)\n\n...prepared for medicial abortion with Dr. Google\n\n...made my space cozy, comfortable and clean (would recommend this for an MA & getting home from an SA) -- I had my TV ready for some streaming, I had ready to eat meals available (mostly frozen stuff or prepped snacks), blankets and pillows, most comfortable clothes I own washed and ready, toiletries are a whole nother thing, and I gave myself the ok to power down for a few days so I could rest and recharge. \n\n**This is just ideas. Definitely look into self-care before, during and after an abortion if that is the route you take (self-care no matter what is great but especially during a hard time like this). It really helped me to journel the whole process.",

That all happened within 4 hours for me. I even napped through two hours of it. I just kept getting up because I felt like I needed to pee.

I was also in a very toxic relationship with their father who had put me through hell. Still kind of does, but we split up back in 2021. Still I was stuck home with my parents, no money, no life, couldn\u2019t afford daycare, barley had money help from their father. I was deeply depressed, I barley brushed my teeth and my hair was matted due to just hating my life. All I did was live purely for my boys sake. I hated my life, hated being a mom, questioned why I ever even went through with it. I\u2019d see happy family\u2019s, and \u201cPinterest moms\u201d doing everything I wasn\u2019t with my kids and felt guilty. Eventually I met someone in the beginning of this year, he took me and my kids in, supports us financially, my boys have their own room! I\u2019ve been able to finally start an education for college classes, I finally found a program for free daycare and after waiting on a long list they will be approved any day now which means I can start working! I haven\u2019t had a job in YEARS. I finally felt like I got my life back then boom, positive pregnancy test. And it\u2019s illegal in Texas. Ugh, all my hopes and dreams out the window; how could I do this again, I don\u2019t like being a stay at home mother it is not good. It\u2019s suffocating, boring, you lose your identity. I knew right away I\u2019d have to schedule an abortion out of state which is gonna be a pain in the ass but something I\u2019m will to do. Luckily my boyfriend supports me because he\u2019s amazing but my parents are not happy with my decision and think it\u2019ll mess me up mentally which I\u2019m sure it will but keeping another kid would do way more damage. They have seen my struggle with my sons they have seen my pain to do everything I can to give them everything. What is y\u2019all\u2019s advice? I wish I never told them at this point, I\u2019ve debated keeping it but then I remember the nights I prayed for a better life because I hated being a stay at home mom so much. I\u2019d only have regrets having another kid and that unborn kid doesn\u2019t deserve that .",

My context is this: I had my abortion due to poor prenatal diagnosis.  My baby would have lived a freaking horrible life, and so people always tell me what a hero I was to saver her from that.  And ok, yes, I do believe I probably saved her from some utter horrors -- but I KNOW FOR SURE I saved myself.  And there's a lot of weight to that, because part of my conditioning as a woman is that, to be a good woman, I have to put others first all of the time, ESPECIALLY my children.  To be a good mother, I have to give of myself until I give myself out.  That's the story we tell about mothers.  That's the water we swim in. (Deep down, I know it's bullshit. But here I am.)  \n\nIf you miscarry, you don't have to confront the self-preserving, self-affirming piece of this in the same way as if you choose to end this pregnancy.  That's why miscarriage is so much more desirable.  It's so easy.  Best of all worlds.  You get to have the freedom you desire and it doesn't have to be your responsibility to choose it over self-sacrifice. \n\nBut responsibility isn't such a bad thing!  Good parents are RESPONSIBLE.  It's ok to take responsibility for when and if you have children. \n\nAnd letting yourself matter is actually great!  Basic worthiness is so crucial to showing up in the world with love and power.  It's impossible to really be a beautiful, loving, generous person if you're always punishing yourself.  \n\nWhat I'm saying is: you get to want what you want.  You get to be responsible in the way that makes sense to you.  Feel into your whole body for the answer.  What do you REALLY want here?  Because the answer to that is generally a pretty decent moral compass.  I trust that you are deeply good and so your desires are deeply good and your decision will be deeply good, whatever it is.  \n\nHonoring you so much in this moment.  It's ok to feel conflicted.  It's important to let yourself matter, whatever that means to you.  For some, letting herself matter will mean changing her plans and having a baby.  For others, letting herself matter will mean ending a pregnancy so she can make space in her life to thrive without a baby.

I was absolutely terrified to take these pills after reading all the horror stories. But, so far, it\u2019s been a pretty mild experience.  \n\nAbout two hours before, I took 800 mg of ibuprofen. One hour prior, I took Zofran and 325 mg of hydrocodone/Tylenol I had left over from another procedure. Highly recommend doubling up on ibuprofen and Tylenol (I piggyback them so I\u2019m alternating taking meds every two-ish hours and not losing pain relief at the same time). \n\nWithin twenty minutes of taking the miso tablets, I started having period cramps and they ramped up over about 45 minutes. I was a little freaked that it was hurting so significantly so early on, and with the amount of pain meds I had in me (but it still never got worse than period cramps). Then the cramps suddenly became barely noticeable and I started bleeding. This has been how the last 4ish hours have gone. I\u2019ll get the occasional back cramp or a few minutes of isolated lower stomach/uterine cramps, but nothing bad at all. \n\nBleeding has not been as much as I expected but the clots are insane. Every time I stand up, I have to scurry to the bathroom and sit and let it empty (gross, I know) before doing whatever it was I stood up to do. \n\nI\u2019ve had no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea thus far (but I did take the Zofran beforehand). \n\nJust wanted to share my positive experience to help out anyone who is feeling panicked, like I did. I was fully convinced I would need to go to the hospital, etc. but it\u2019s going fine. I\u2019ll update as it continues.\n\nUpdate: (12 hours since taking the first round of miso pills). My bleeding kicked up a notch for maybe 3 hours and I was starting to get freaked out, but it\u2019s down to average period levels now. I haven\u2019t passed any more tissue so I believe it\u2019s about done. I hope others have as mild of an experience as I have had so far! \n\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND Always Discreet diapers. Just cannot recommend enough. Get the diapers. Also, a heating pad. Ideally, two (one for stomach, one for back).",

I'd sit with you, listen to anything you wanted to share, give you tissues for your tears, bring you hot tea or whatever would comfort you.\n\nI admire you so much for listening to your own wisdom. You are a very strong person with great self-awareness. You know what is best for yourself and you are acting on that knowledge, rather than allowing yourself to be manipulated by other people. You are honoring yourself by following your instincts, even though it is so difficult and so lonely.\n\nIt's so hard to go through this experience without a supportive partner. He sounds so unloving and so disrespectful and so self-centered, only caring about himself and not honoring your wants and needs. He is not even speaking with you at a time when you need care the most. This kind of silent treatment is a form of emotional abuse. You deserve so much better.\n\nMy heart is with you. I am so sorry you are alone, but I am so in awe of your self-respect and wisdom. You are not ready to give birth and parent a new human being into adulthood. By trusting yourself, you are preventing so much suffering. So much pain and struggle comes when people continue accidental pregnancies that happen at the wrong time, in the wrong circumstances.\n\nIt's so understandable that you are scared. Going through a miscarriage (spontaneous abortion) or an abortion (a chosen miscarriage) is not a familiar experience. On top of that, there is a lot of fake information out there. People who are against abortions -- most of them men who never will even know what it is like to get pregnant -- get great pleasure out of spreading lies to create fear.\n\nTry to keep reminding yourself that millions of people have had medication abortions without any problems. It's truly one of the safest procedures on earth. Most people say afterward that the fear made everything feel worse, and they wish they had not been so afraid.  Women have been having miscarriages, abortions and births throughout history -- we are strong and can handle the pain of all of these experiences.\n\nYou are strong. You are amazingly strong! You are doing what is best for yourself, even though it's so hard. I have so much faith that you can and will be OK. In the future, you will look back and feel so very proud of yourself.\n\nTo help with the loneliness, and to help pass the time during this experience, consider looking at this friendly zine created by wonderful people who don't want anyone to feel alone even if they are alone for their abortions.

I say that because I spent weeks contemplating and going back and forth about whether or not I wanted my baby and by the time I decided to schedule an appointment I was already almost 8 weeks and they couldn\u2019t get me in for a whole month so I was just miserable with the nausea longer.

        "body": "Hi everyone! I need advice on my situation and let me just say it\u2019s a VERY complicated situation. So 2 years ago I started a relationship with a guy that happens to be my cousin. Yes I know this is very weird and it\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of at all. It\u2019s a tough situation cause I truly love him and he\u2019s the perfect guy minus the cousin part. \nI truly wish we weren\u2019t related at all. He feels the same way. He is 13 years older and we didn\u2019t grow up together. We really didn\u2019t start being around one another until I was 20 (currently 25).\n\nFast forward to December 2020 I found out I was pregnant. No one in my family knew about the relationship or situation. When I broke the news to my family they were shocked, disgusted, and angry. They completely excommunicated my cousin and told me the only option was abortion. Like I said I\u2019m not proud of the situation at all I just couldn\u2019t help who I loved. \n\nI had been planning on keeping the baby but ended up caving into my family and getting the abortion. That abortion was and continues to be very traumatic for me. I was 13 weeks pregnant at the time of the abortion. My parents and pretty much my family that is aware of the situation never discusses the situation and acts like it never happened. They basically act like my cousin was never part of the family. I myself am embarrassed by the situation. \n\nFor the past two years I\u2019ve been back in the relationship with him and my family doesn\u2019t know. If they knew they\u2019d be furious. I\u2019ve gone back and fourth between loving him and wanting to be with him but also knowing I\u2019ll never get to live a free open love life if I\u2019m with him. And that I\u2019ll never have any family support. It\u2019s basically like living a secret life.\n\nI\u2019m a week late and this morning something in me said take a test so I did. It came back positive and I don\u2019t know what to do. I wanna be excited but feel anxious and depressed. \nI haven\u2019t told him yet and don\u2019t know if I will. He has made it clear if I got pregnant again he thinks we should keep it. I just know my family would never be supportive. I\u2019m debating on having another abortion but feel the guilt already. I am truly lost and feel like I have no one to talk to. \n\nPart of me wants to rush and schedule an abortion and not tell anyone not even the baby\u2019s father. Another part of me is debating telling my family. I honestly don\u2019t know if I have it in me to tell them again. The first time was extremely scary and they obviously didn\u2019t take the news well. I have no doubt it would be the same situation. I also don\u2019t know if I want another abortion. I\u2019m so lost\u2026\n\nMy question is what should I do? Any advice is greatly appreciated. \n\nYes I know this is a fucked up situation to say the least but I ask for you to please try and reserve judgement.\n\nAlso I live in the U.S. and technically cousin marriage is legal in my state. I live in the North Eastern part of the U.S. but it is not common here at least to my knowledge. And it is not something \u201cnormal\u201d in my family.",

COVID happened a few months later and I figured, ok it\u2019s a blessing in disguise.\n\nFast forward today, I found out I was pregnant but right from the start, I knew I didn\u2019t want it. There were just so many things to consider - my health, our finances, our future plans for the next year. It was never an easy decision but we discussed it back and forth, fought and cried even, but in the end, we knew the terminating the pregnancy was the best option for us. \n\nWhile decision should be 100% yours, a conversation with him on what you both feel regarding this matter will help you go through this.",

He is 43 and I am 30. Our relationship is very healthy and happy. We are very financially secure. We have an almost 10 old son that I had prior to meeting my husband but he has taken on the role of dad from day one. My entire life is dedicated to being a mother and I have been yearning to do so again. \n\nWe have been trying the entire time we have been together to have a child and it has not happened. I have PCOS which makes it more difficult and he is on a hormone replacement therapy.. combined we have unfortunately never been able to get pregnant. We have an open (ish) relationship where I am allowed to see others.\n\nI found out I was pregnant 4 weeks with the other mans child. Timeline matched up that is was his and not my husbands. I was devastated. We discussed it and my husband was willing to raise my child as his own (as he has already done) as long as I never told the child or their father the truth. I couldn\u2019t do that to this child. It would have been extremely selfish to let this child go their whole life not knowing. So I had an abortion. I never told the child\u2019s father and I so badly want to as I feel he has a right to know.\n\nIt has been 6 weeks since the abortion. I\u2019m extremely depressed and out of touch lately. I have to fake it and push through as I have another child that depends on me so I do. No one knows my situation except for my husband. I regret it every single day. I look at my son and think that I could have another version of him, but I killed his sibling. I resent my husband as I feel I chose him over my own child. It isn\u2019t his fault and I know that, but I can\u2019t help but feel that way. I resent my body for not allowing me to get pregnant with my husband but instead getting pregnant with another man\u2019s child.\n\nMy husband made me end it with the other man as I had become too attached to him after the abortion. I feel guilty that he has no idea. He is a good man and deserves that but I can\u2019t tell him.\n\nEvery single day is a struggle to survive and get through. I regret my decision. If I could do it again, I would have had my child and done what was right for me regardless of what my husband would think or do. I thought I was doing it to protect my 9 year old and our family.. instead it is tearing us apart from the father he has always known.\n\nI know my situation is very different than most. OP, I hope you make the right decision for you whatever that may be and I wish you peace in your decision. Thank you for giving me a place to tell my story.",

He said \u201cwhatever you want but let\u2019s talk about it.\u201d We discussed all of it for hours and he agreed with me that the abortion was probably our best option but that he\u2019d support whatever decision I wanted. He found the clinic, I scheduled the appointment, he drove me and supported me every step of the way. After it was all done and I was going through my hormones I would ask \u201cdid we make the right decision?\u201d And without hesitation every time he said \u201cabsolutely.\u201d He reassured me, held me and loved me the entire time. I couldn\u2019t have asked for better support. Fast forward over 7 months later and it\u2019s not even something we think about, if anything it made our relationship stronger. This is a big decision to make and how he treated me during this process just made me love him more. \n\nI believe it should always be left up to women to make this decision and their partner should support that decision since it\u2019s our bodies that go through a massive transformation to birth a child. However, I recognize it is their child too so I believe having an open dialogue is important. I\u2019ve always felt this way and discussed it with my SO early on in the relationship because I will not date someone who doesn\u2019t agree. So the fact that we were on the same page about this was a huge benefit to how well he handled it. However, I think discussing it beforehand and weighing the options with your partner and reasons why you want the abortion is healthy and vital to get all of your thoughts out and also make them feel secure in your decision. For us my partner was worried I hadn\u2019t thought this decision through and he wanted to make sure I had given it the attention it deserved. After our conversation he was like yeah you\u2019ve thought a lot about this, let\u2019s do it.

        "body": "\n\n\nSo, about a month ago, I found out I was pregnant, and after debating with my boyfriend we decided a child wasn\u2019t a good option for us in the near future. We\u2019re both living on the more unfortunate side, so raising a baby isn\u2019t on our agenda for at least the next couple years. \n\nI booked the appointment online, and thought about going through with the medical procedure, but I\u2019ve done research and found that some girls go through some of the worst pain, and that the pill procedure isn\u2019t effective some of the time. I for sure knew I just wanted to visit the clinic once, so I opted for the surgical procedure after doing more research. I\u2019ve found out that the procedure is way more quick, and way more effective, so that\u2019s the way I wanted it to go. \n\nDay before: my anxiety was through the roof, and the fact I wasn\u2019t able to eat anything for 6 hours prior to going to the clinic was stressing me out too. During my last 2 weeks of pregnancy, if I wouldn\u2019t eat for a long period of time I would become a nightmare to be around. And my appointment is at 1:45 the next day. So I woke up bright and early at 5am to have a small meal to help me last the day. Just oatmeal and some fruit. \n\nDay of: I was hungry and emotional by the time I got to the clinic, at 1:45pm. As soon as I entered, I did some paperwork. Then I was greeted by one of the nurses to do an ultrasound. I was given the options to see the ultrasound, be given a photo of the ultrasound or to not see it at all. I got the photo so I can look at it when I\u2019m ready. The normal ultrasound didn\u2019t work for me, so i had to get the vaginal one. It didn\u2019t hurt at all, but just pressure. Blood pressure and blood type was taken.. and I was back in the waiting room. \nThe next thing I went though was talking to a counsellor, she just guided me through the procedure and explained everything. Made my nerves calm a bit. Then I was put in the back waiting room.. during that time, the same nurse who took my ultra sound, just gave me some medication, for antibiotics for potential infections, Advil for future pain, and a small pill to help with the anxiety. Back to the waiting room, another kind nurse called me and introduced herself and she did my iv, along with some more blood work. Then I was back into the waiting room\u2026 \nAfter waiting about 20 minutes, they finally called me in to go through with the procedure. Everyone in the room was super respectful, and kind, which helped my anxiety a lot. The nurse asked if I was okay to start, which I agreed to. Then she injected the anesthesia into my iv, and honestly I didn\u2019t think I would be as strong as it was.. not to scare anyone, it helped so much. I remember looking up at the painting on the ceiling, and feeling a bit of cramping and discomfort but nothing totally painful. The whole procedure only felt like 30 seconds, but I think I might\u2019ve fell asleep.. when we were done, the nurse woke me up and gave me some mesh underwear with a pad and helped me to the recovery area, where I was able to rest my eyes and wait for the anesthesia to wear off, and I also ate some cookies and had some ginger ale. After being in there for 30 mins, I was able to go home. I got my sister to pick me up and we went and had some chicken because I was starving by the time I left the clinic. I ate, went home and napped for a couple hours. I woke up with some cramps but nothing some Advil can\u2019t fix. I feel totally normal, it just feels like I\u2019m on my period now. Slight bleeding, minor cramps, and a bit lazy. \n\nOverall, I\u2019m happy with my decision. It was fast and easy. And I hope this helps anyone that chose the surgical route and is having anxiety over it. I read many posts about the surgical method and it comforted me, knowing most girls had a positive experience. So I wanted to share mine, in hopes I can help comfort anyone with my story too. Sending lots of love!",

Hope this is helpful to someone! And if anyone had a similar experience, let me know how it went :)\n\n12/13, morning: bleeding started (very light, darker in color)\n\n12/13, 2pm: took two pregnancy tests, both were positive (took them 20-30 mins apart)\n\n12/14, morning: moderate cramping, morning nausea \n\n12/14, evening: stronger cramping, no nausea\n\n12/15, morning: some nausea in morning, went away quickly\n\n12/15, 8:30 am: arrived for my first appointment with PP for MAB, there were a couple people outside trying to hand out pro-life pamphlets and attempted to talk to me\u2014I ignored\n\n12/15, 10 am: at this point, blood was taken to test for hcg hormone level, and ultrasound was done twice. ultrasound could not diagnose a pregnancy, but a gestational sac was found and I was measured at about 4 wks 5 days\n\n12/15, 10:35 am: PA told me that they could not move forward with the MAB because of my symptoms (bleeding & cramping/pain). they were worried about an ectopic pregnancy. I was also told that they would consult with the doctor that does the SAB procedures, and at the time they told me I wouldn\u2019t be able to be seen until 12/27 (which is too late for me since I would be out of town for the holidays). I was told to call if symptoms worsen, but nothing further was done that day.\n\n12/15, 11am: finally left the PP clinic, and headed home. the rest of the day was pretty uneventful besides some more bleeding and cramping (which I took Advil for)\n\n12/16, 10:30am: I receive a call from the nurse who told me my test results. My hcg level was at 416, which is in the range for how far along I was but was still considered on the low side. they wanted to have me come and do another blood test the following day to see if my levels double or not. (if it doubles: pregnancy is growing normally, if it drops: miscarriage, if it stays the same or doesn\u2019t increase significantly: abnormal) I was scheduled to come in the next day at 9am.\n\n12/16, evening: bleeding was about the same, but a bit more brown in color, and cramping was worse at night.\n\n12/17, 9am: arrived again at PP for my second blood draw. I had no nausea at this point but bleeding was increasingly getting more worrisome (slowly getting heavier and darker). there were a bunch of protesters surrounding the clinic, since Saturday is the most popular day for pro-lifers to stand outside the clinic. I was able to get into the building through the garage and was guided by an employee. Security was at the front and back of the building. Honestly was pretty shocking and surreal to witness.\n\n12/17, 9:40 am: blood was drawn, I was released to go back home.\n\n12/17, evening: bleeding and cramping remained the same, again the pain seemed to be worse at night. Still no nausea \n\n12/18: PP is closed, so the call with my test results would happen the next day in the morning, to see what my next steps were. this day my bleeding got heavier again, and I started noticing small blood clots. Got worse as the night went on, took Advil for the pain & cramping. I also started getting lower back pain.\n\n12/19, 8:30am: dark red bleeding, and small blood clots. No nausea but lower back pain was still present. No call from PP yet\n\n12/19, 11:15am: PP finally calls, and they told me my hcg level was at 490, which was only a 18% increase and considered abnormal. they insisted that I needed to come in that day, and to see the specialist for a possible SAB (aspiration) procedure. I was scheduled to go at 1:30, and they told me I would expect to stay there for 3-4 hours, and that I would need someone to pick me up. Luckily, my boyfriend was able to drop me off and pick me up that day.\n\n12/19, 1:30pm: arrived at PP for my appt, once again. At this point my cramping was pretty painful, but nothing more different than the cramping from a heavy period. \n\n12/19, 1:45pm: I was called in, and I was put in a room where I went over my medical history and symptoms, as well as what we were going to do. The plan was to do another ultrasound to either locate the pregnancy (or not), and then to draw blood and prepare for the aspiration.\n\n12/19, 2:20pm: they finished the ultrasound, and they were not able to see anything in my uterus. so, now we were moving on to the next part of the plan. my cramping was still pretty bad, and I was getting more anxious/nervous as time went on.\n\n12/19, 3pm: after going over the risks and details of the procedure, I signed some consent forms and was sent to the room where they would be doing the aspiration. I used the bathroom at this time, and two decent sized blood clots (and maybe tissue) came out of me and was in the toilet. This made me a bit more nervous, since I was debating just going home and letting the miscarriage happen on its own. But since there was still a risk for ectopic, I decided to stick with what the nurses were telling me to be safe rather than sorry.\n\n12/19, 3:36pm: another nurse comes in and asks me a couple more general health questions, and proceeds to drawing my blood and inserting the IV that I would be using during the procedure. I was also given a couple pills of ibuprofen for the pain.\n\n12/19, 4pm: around this time (can\u2019t exactly remember or get a time since I obviously was not on my phone or looking at my watch) is when the procedure started. they first administered the anxiety medication to calm my nerves, and then they gave the sedation (which was a very small dosage of fentanyl). at this point, she numbed my cervix, and I honestly didn\u2019t feel the injections. all I could feel was some pressure from the speculum that was holding the walls of my vagina apart. the nurses talked to me the whole time, and I didn\u2019t hear or notice the suction at all. it was over very quickly, and it honestly wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought after reading a lot of peoples experiences with aspiration. they gave me wipes to clean the lube & blood off myself, and they waited until I dressed myself. The procedure itself probably took around 5 minutes.\n\n12/19, 4:30pm: I was moved to the recovery area, and I immediately started feeling very nauseous. but luckily with some salty snacks and water/sprite to drink, I slowly started feeling better. the cramping also started feeling pretty painful, and I ranked it at about a 7/10 (though looking back, it was definitely more like an 8 or 9). the nurse that was watching me was able to give me something else for the pain, and after about 10-15 mins the relief finally kicked in. I used the bathroom before I left because they wanted to check my bleeding, and since it was a normal amount they were able to release me.\n\n12/19, 5pm: the nurse walked me down, and my boyfriend was there to pick me up and bring me home. I didn\u2019t feel too bad on the drive home, just some light cramping but nothing like I was feeling before.\n\n12/19, 7pm: I changed my pad, and the blood now looks brighter in color. No visible blood clots, and starting to feel slightly nauseous every time I get up.\n\n12/19, 8pm: I took some anti-nausea meds (Dramamine long lasting) since my nausea was still persistent.\n\nAt the time I am writing this, it is 8:40 pm. I will update you all as the days go on if you guys are interested :))",

I am a firm believer that personally, if my baby won\u2019t have a good quality of life that I shouldn\u2019t keep it even if it breaks me. I am completely heartbroken because I know people can live with klinefelters syndrome but they can struggle and may never be independent. So my only option personally is to get a late term abortion. I will have to travel states because of these abortion laws but this is why abortion being accessible is so important. This situation is already so traumatic and heartbreaking and now I have to go out of my way to get this done so my baby won\u2019t suffer. I was so excited for my baby boy and I\u2019m so heartbroken about having an abortion. I honestly don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get over this but I guess that\u2019s just life ig.",

It took us 10 months of being off birth control to conceive her, and ~6 of those months we were tracking ovulation and actively trying. \nWe love her to death but do not want more kids. I had a high risk pregnancy and then extreme ppd. I am afraid for my physcial and mental health if I were to have another child. \n\nIn September, I VERY unexpectedly found out I was pregnant and had a medical abortion at ~5 weeks. We had been dumb and were using the pull out method, but not once did we have a time where we were worried we messed up. I know that doesn't matter. Should have been smarter. Anyway, it was very shocking.\n\nThe MA was extremely painful for me and the entire ordeal was traumatic to be honest. I always knew I'd get an abortion if I got pregnant, but now going through it I NEVER want to experience that again. I am TERRIFIED of getting pregnant again. We are using condoms (which we both absolutely hate and have a hard time enjoying ourselves with) and I am also back on the pill. That doesn't matter. I am so anxious. I never want to have sex and when we do I often get panicky and cry afterwards. I got my period back last month and it was the biggest relief. Now my next one is suppose to start in 6 days, and I am so anxious waiting to see if it will come. Any time I have any feeling that relates to pregnancy symptoms I had in the past, I panic thinking I must be pregnant.\n\nI feel so bad for my partner. I feel broken. It took me so long to be interested in sex again after we had our daughter, and soon after I was this happens. And now I don't want to be touched at all. He has been so understanding and doesn't pressure me, but I just wish it could be like it was before :( \n\nThanks for reading my rant. If any of you can relate let me know \ud83d\udc95",

My ferritin was \"less than 12 ng/ml\" \u2013 I don't know how much less. Normal for women is 15-125.\n\nMy period is usually light, but the abortion-related bleeding was not! I bled quite heavily for almost two weeks, having to change the pad every few hours.\n\nThe days and weeks after the abortion, I have begun to feel so tired. For instance, last night I slept for almost 10 hours but now, 2 hours after waking up, I feel  exhausted and too tired to do anything. At the same time, I am overworked both at work and at home. There is so much to do, but so little energy to do it, and it makes me want to cry. Little things (such as a meeting at work, or going to run errands) make me so tired that I just want to go straight home and lie under the duvet. I already had burnout symptoms earlier this Fall, and feel close to breaking point.\n\nI am otherwise healthy, in a healthy weight (maybe a bit underweight), eat enough (2000-2500 calories a day) and incorporate veggies and fruits into my diet, take supplements (D-vitamin, omega3, and since a couple of months, iron), exercise most days of the week, and sleep 7-8 hours almost every night. I am totally ok with my choice to get an abortion psychologically, so I don't think these symptoms relate to that part of it either.\n\nThis cold and dark time of the year combined with the anemia (likely worsened by the abortion) is really making it difficult to perform at work and live a full life.\n\nHow much can an abortion set you back in terms of iron levels?

              "body": "Even though you know it was the right decision to end that pregnancy when you were 15, it's OK to have sad feelings about it now. At the time, as you say, you were shocked and focused on the fear of the procedure itself. It was likely such a confusing time for you, as it was for me. I was younger than 15, and everything was so strange and disorienting and scary. People didn't prepare me or tell me anything, I was just swept along in a kind of stunned daze.\n\nIt's hard not to think about our abortion experiences in this world of constant news about abortions and all of the cruel laws that politicians have passed to restrict our healthcare. There are so many reminders around us that can stir up feelings. It makes sense you are thinking about that experience more these days, and the distance of three years gives you a different perspective.\n\nEnding a pregnancy is a loss and it's OK to grieve. What I've learned is that we never 'get over' loss and grief -- instead we carry on with our losses and grief, and they evolve with us through a lifetime. Losses pile up as we grow, and our perspectives change at different phases of our lives. I guess what I am trying to say is that it's normal and OK to look back from a distance and feel whatever you feel -- feelings are not right or wrong.\n\nSensing that you knew it was a boy is OK, too. Lots of people have an inner wisdom about their pregnancies that cannot be explained by current medical science. You can respect and trust your feelings.\n\nYou can consider honoring your pregnancy loss  -- with a ritual or another action that feels right to you. You can look at this Abortion Resolution Workbook that shares the different ways other people have processed their loss. [https://www.pregnancyoptions.info/abortion-resolution-workbook](https://www.pregnancyoptions.info/abortion-resolution-workbook)\n\nAnd it's not unusual to not feel excited about intimacy when you have feelings of grief. I hope your partner will be compassionate and understanding and give you as much time as you need to reflect on your feelings.\n\nGrief has no real timeline, and grief is not linear. It becomes a part of us, and sad feelings can visit us at various times throughout life. To bring honor and dignity to our losses, we can let grief transform us into more sensitive, loving, compassionate people -- because everyone experiences loss and grief.\n\nI have never experienced grief over a child I did not have when I was so young and had an abortion, but I have experienced grief over the loss of my own childhood, and grief over the time I wasted believing the lies that I was a terrible person. Sadness over these losses bubbles up from time to time, but I am not afraid and I am not destroyed by these feelings. I think they are a sign of humanity, and I am grateful.\n\nI don't mean to ramble on so long. And I am not sure if any of this will resonate with you. So please just think of this message as a hug of understanding and empathy from someone who cares about you and what you are feeling.",

What if you're allowed to be relieved and also sad at the same time?  What if you're allowed to be HAPPY about your choice and also grieve what  mihgt have been anyway?  What if feelings don't ever have to add up to one neat and tidy storyline?  \n\nHow to be with a feeling?  Find it in your physical body. Every feeling makes an impression of physical sensations (like hot/cold or tight/open or rough/smooth etc.) in your body.  Find the sensations that go with your feeling and see if you can tolerate just those, welcome them into your body, give them some time and attention.  Feelings sometimes tell stories.  It's ok.  You don't have to believe the stories, but it does help to listen to them, to give them a little love back, even if the stories they're telling don't make sense. \n\nThis is a somatic approach to feelings.

My first one was done at 8 weeks and 5 days. I took the 1 dose of mifepristone then about 40 hours later I took 4 pills of misoprostol. During this time I experienced cramps that were about a 9/10 pain wise. I also passed very large clots and had heavy bleeding. This all lasted for about 2 hours. Afterwards I just had mild to moderate bleeding and no cramps. I used ibuprofen for pain and a heating pad. My second MA I was 7 weeks and 4 days. Again I took the 1 dose of mifepristone and then about 27 hours later I took my 4 misoprostol. This time around I was more prepared and stayed on the toilet the entire time. I also took my pain meds 30 minutes prior to taking the 4 pills that expel the pregnancy. My cramps were about a 7/10. I passed small/medium sized clots and bled heavy. This took about 3 hours. Afterwards I had pretty moderate bleeding and some on and off cramping. Honestly both times I was able to return to regular activities the next day with little to no discomfort. However, everyone is different! My health care provider was amazing at letting me know what to expect. They also provided me with an information packet in case I had questions or concerns. Remember you are still technically inducing labor/miscarriage with the pill. There is a possibility you may have painful cramping, pass clots up to the size of a lemon, nausea, dizziness and diarrhea when taking the abortion pill. Pain meds and a heating pad or hot water bottle will be your best friends during this time! Good luck OP \u2764\ufe0f",

What might be easier about it is that you can be at home for the abortion, and you can have a loved one or friend hang out with you. Both in-clinic and medication abortions are super safe, so it will really come down to your preference.\n\nThis guide, from \"How To Use Abortion Pill,\" goes over what the process looks like--including timeline and a good schedule for taking painkillers--for most people: [https://www.howtouseabortionpill.org/howto/](https://www.howtouseabortionpill.org/howto/). (Mifepristone + misoprostol is more common and likely what you'll have.) During the period after you take the misoprostol, you'll experience bleeding and cramping, so you probably should plan that time for when you don't have to be at work; lots of people go back to work the next day, though, once it's all done.\n\nSending you good vibes for a positive abortion experience!

But basically, Missouri's abortion ban targets the person who performs the abortion, not the person who has one. The law says that \"a woman upon whom an abortion is performed or induced in violation of this subsection shall not be prosecuted for a conspiracy to violate the provisions of this subsection.\" So the actual abortion ban itself says you can't be prosecuted for having the abortion. \n\nHowever, other kinds of laws (like ones that make it a crime to use drugs during pregnancy) have been used to criminalize people having abortions with pills at home.  In my very-not-a-lawyer opinion,  the hypothetical risk of you being prosecuted under one of those laws doesn't hold a candle to the very real and present risk of having a child that ties you to a man with a history of controlling and abusive behavior. \n\nStill, it is safest to keep your abortion private - check out the Security and Privacy tips in the menu. Remember that if he's controlling and scary now, there's a good chance he was already violating your privacy during your relationship.",

I know, stupid. Anyways.\n\nShortly after I got pregnant I was very depressed, ended things with my ex because I just wasn\u2019t happy.\n\nPlanned on having the baby till we broke up when I was about 7 weeks pregnant. After breaking up, he became OBSESSIVE. Harassing me, damn near stalking me. I\u2019m talking 20+ texts begging for me back after I was firm with him SO many times. Even sent me some shit that scared me and had \u201cif I can\u2019t have you no one can\u201d vibes\u2026 No matter what I\u2019ve said he would not stop. This has continued until now. 11 weeks today. My aid access pills arrive today. I planned on taking them Sunday when I\u2019m off work.\n\nIn a final attempt to get him to leave me alone, I told him I\u2019m not pregnant anymore. He lost it. He claims because we planned the baby and \u201cdid it\u201d without his permission his mom is paying for him to take me to court. Says because I\u2019m so far along I could face prison time. I don\u2019t really buy that but I\u2019m also a single mom of two and can\u2019t afford a legal battle. \n\n\nI know what I did was really fucking stupid. But please someone tell me it\u2019s okay and this is all manipulation before I take these pills. I do not want a life tie to him. Give me some hope even though I did a shitty thing?\n\nETA I\u2019m in Missouri. I ordered pills from aid access",

        "body": "I\u2019m 20 years old and been with my boyfriend for a few months and we were pretty reckless on how we went about our sexual relationship since the beginning and surprise surprise i tested positive in October. According to my last period i\u2019d be around 11 weeks, I\u2019ve made an appointment before to get a clinical abortion but my mom got in the way of it (she didn\u2019t let me go out that day) and i had to cancel. My parents are extremely religious, they\u2019ve told me themselves that having an abortion would mean i\u2019d go to hell and included their lovely opinion that me getting raped wouldn\u2019t be an excuse for an abortion either because god has a reason for everything\u2026 that being said i\u2019m going in for an abortion tomorrow. I\u2019m not nervous about my decision I know i\u2019m doing the right thing i would be a terrible person to bring a child into this world that wouldn\u2019t have the proper care it deserved but i\u2019m worried because my mother is crazy and she has my location on and checks it frequently and her finding out would mean me being homeless and motherless so i made a plan with my boyfriend that he won\u2019t come with me to Planned Parenthood instead he\u2019ll go down the street to the movie theater and take my phone with him so it says we\u2019re at the movies and she won\u2019t think to call. My appointment is at 1 i know they usually say to plan to be there for 3-4 hours so i\u2019m hoping the ultrasound will show less than 10 weeks and i get the pill and i\u2019m able to get out in 2 hours. If i am 11 weeks then surgical it is and ill have to make some shit up that my phone died to account for the last hour i shouldn\u2019t be at the movies for (said we\u2019re watching Black Panther which is around 3 hours long). I don\u2019t think i need advice unless anyone has another great excuse to what i can say if she gets suspicious? & turning off my location isn\u2019t an option she\u2019s insane and would lock me in my room and never let me out again lol. And my boyfriend planned to have me out all day to be away from my house (my mom has already been suspicious of me being pregnant so he didn\u2019t want me to have like a blood attack while she was home and instead of her assuming it\u2019s my period she knows what i did). This was more of a mommy issues rant but you can see why me carrying on with this baby would not work out for me, if i\u2019m being completely honest knowing me and my issues it would break me so far i wouldn\u2019t be here. \n\nAlso for anyone who is on the fence about getting an abortion the regretfulparents page really helped me validate my reasonings for doing this like I love my boyfriend and would love to have his kid but he works a regular coffee shop job and i work two jobs both with shit pay and i\u2019m trying to find a better job for me not a baby so it just wouldn\u2019t be right i can\u2019t provide the child with a good future im sure id be a horrible mother too considering i don\u2019t have the best example, it would be selfish of me to keep it.\n\n\nUPDATE!!!: I had my abortion this afternoon. The wait time killed me i was in planned parenthood for about 5 hours the actual procedure was done in 10 minutes and i decided to not get any sedative because i know it would mean i would have to stay longer and i really just wanted to get out of there. They gave me 800mg of Ibuprofen which did nothing for me the numbing injection into my cervix helped though it sort of made my legs go numb but i could still feel it. The pain wasn\u2019t as bad as i thought but definitely a pain i hadn\u2019t felt before i gave it like a 5/10 it\u2019s just very uncomfortable in the moment. Staff was insanely nice and caring made me feel comfortable to the best of their abilities, one of the nurses held my hands the whole time and she was wearing a batman clip on her credentials so i asked her if she liked superheroes and she said yes which i do as well so we talked about that (talking the whole time helped me not think about it) they were done before i knew it. I will say for me personally the suction was probably the most \u201ctraumatizing\u201d part i only say that because after the appointment i started to get flash backs of what the suction sounded like and felt like so that kind of sucked. I definitely felt relieved after it was over but now i\u2019m home and in bed alone and i feel my thoughts coming and going making me wonder\u2026i did the right thing and i don\u2019t regret it but i still can\u2019t help but wonder what could\u2019ve been. If i don\u2019t think about it im okay and fine but if i let the thoughts in it makes me a little sad. I was able to get a copy of the ultrasound photo per my request because i wanted to show my boyfriend. All in all it was fine im fine it just sucks that things like this have to happen. But i promise anyone going through this we did the right thing and it\u2019s going to be okay and even when you feel like you could have done something different you chose you and hopefully now we can look forward to thinking about kids in the future when we\u2019re prepared not when you\u2019re scared and young or just not ready\u2764\ufe0f",

So my theory so far is this, if the treatment worked for us without major bleeding (I really hope this is the case), the minor spotting was originated by the very little material there was to discharge at that point, and when the time came for the actual period days, since there was an early discharge of the lining, only the period cramps and other symptoms remained. Once again, I just know enough to know I'm probably overestimating my knowledge in the field, but I hope this is the case so there's no need for an extra dose.\n\nI'll keep everyone posted as time goes by :). She has an important event through the weekend so probably we'll get the test done till next week, since the first one was a blood test barely 7 days from conception and the abortion process was 9 days from conception, I'm guessing if it was effective, hcg leves wouldn't rise any further from the initial rise so a urine test should do. We'll probably use a couple test brands and confirm if negative with a blood test just in case.",

Still, I'm not an expert in generic medicine branded as original. My guess is either they fly regularly to buy them in Mexico or Colombia to flip them here, or they just get them by having someone in a hospital with access to the pharmacy, it's a third (and very thirdy) world country so those methods are fairly common to get medicine for free to friends and family. All that, obviously in the assumption that the pills were originals. By chance do you have any clues or things to look out for when using Cytotec?\n\nOn the protocol, I agree, we were tempted to just ignore the instructions and use the recommended protocols, but well, my friend helped with a treatment some time ago for a friend of her and they followed the one we got. Still, if a new dose is indeed required, we'll go with the 4 pills every 3 hours approach.\n\nIn regards to the bleeding, would it be reasonable to have expected less bleeding given the treatment was taken just shy over a week from conception, and still a week and a half away from the expected period start date? I went through lots of papers and systematic reviews when she took the pills but none mentioned anything for cases under 6 weeks.",

        "body": " \n\nHey all!\n\nSome weeks ago I had a very unpleasant incident, a broken condom that resulted into blood pregnancy test returning positive. However, since I was very paranoid she took the blood test 7 days after the incident out of a \"I'll surprise him with a negative blood exam so he can calm down\" instinct, turns out, paranoid was correct and it was positive. By the way, she's 30, no kids, and she took the morning after pill within an hour of the incident, but it was during fertile window.\n\nIt was a casual encounter with a friend and unfortunately, we got lucky. Since both of us are for sure not looking forward to become parents, we decided to buy Misoprostol. Where we live abortion is illegal, so we resorted to some dealer to buy the pills, however, their instructions were different from the ton of research I did prior (4 pills moisturized with 3 drops of water inserted into the vagina every 3 hours for up to 3 doses), still, on a \"well, they do this for a living, let's give these instructions a shot\" realization moment, we went for it. Basically, 2 pills under the tongue, and 2 hours later, 4 pills inserted into the vagina. She took the treatment on day 9 after the incident, counting from the first day of her last period, treatment was taken around week 3.\n\nSymptoms started shortly after the first 2 pills and continued after the 4 pills dose, pretty much all of them, nausea, cramps, chills, fever, vomits (some hours after the second dose), pretty much spent the night awake looking after her symptoms just in case, went to sleep at around 5 AM once she slept for a while and briefly woke up to confirm she was feeling better and the fever started to go down.\n\nThe thing is, there was only one missing symptom, bleeding. There was only very minor brown-like spotting, not even enough to fill one pad. Some weeks went by, and slightly heavier than period-like cramps and other period related symptoms appeared right around the dates where her period was due, however, still no blood.\n\nAfter doing some more research and reading, kept finding the same \"Usually from 6 weeks and up is when pills should be taken\" phrase, but nothing that mentioned a minimum period with an explanation on why that is, that's why we decided to go for the treatment that soon. Our plan for the moment is to wait for the second week of a missed period to get a pharmacy pregnancy test as if the treatment was successful, the hcg hormone would stop rising which should result into a negative test, and plan for a second dose in case it comes out positive. Mid next week she'd have the second week.\n\nStill, we are now both paranoid. Haven't found anything about taking a dose that early, neither telling not to take it that soon or explaining possible effects. So far, after literally days of reading about it, I'm suspecting the very small bleeding cut short her next period by discharging what was built up to that stage on her cycle (basically, under a week after ovulation) which lead to period-like symptoms around the right dates but without bleeding.\n\nMy main concern so far is that the pregnancy test comes out positive, but due to remaining hcg winding down and taking the next dose when it's no longer necessary. I know an ultrasound will be the best approach, but given that abortion is illegal here, we're afraid it'll rise suspicion if the ultra comes out positive and placing the pregnancy at 6 weeks where the miscarriage risk is small, to then just report a miscarriage.\n\nOur very last resort is to take a flight in January to Colombia as clinics there take foreign patients (at least as far as I've read), but it'll be until she's around week 10, which I assume would also bring heavier symptoms and side effects.\n\nI know the path forward is just to wait for the second week to roll by, but I'd appreciate a lot any inputs about this particular situation. And yes, if we have to go for another dose, we'll just buy two extra pills and apply it on the 4 pills every 4 hour dose approach.",

        "body": "Sorry if this is long, I'm going to try to give all of the details that I possibly can. \n\nI will begin by saying that I had a medical abortion in the past, and it was way different. I was 5 weeks, I went to PP. I had heavy bleeding, clots, I saw the sac. It was pretty much by the book what you are supposed to expect. I took both pills, I took the misoprotol vaginally, within an hour, heavy bleeding begun. \n\nThis time, after Roe being overturned, and being financially in a much worse spot, ordered the medications from Aid Access to sit on in case of an emergency.  I hoped I'd never need them, but here I am. Even with two forms of consistent contraceptives bring used and cycle tracking. I was three days late, tired, nauseous and my breasts hurt. I tested positive. Putting me just over 4 weeks. \n\nI took the first pill, waited several hours, as they instructed me to at planned Parenthood last time, and then inserted the four misoprotol tablets vaginally again. This time, the pills took a long time to dissolve. Even after an hour, they weren't all the way dissolved. I cleaned my hands and used some lubricant. That seemed to help. It took about an hour for cramps, almost 6 hours to bleeding to start. This time it is very light comparatively speaking. Maybe similar to midway through a normal period. All more brownish/pinkish blood, no dark red like with my previous experience. No real clots, but definitely some tissue passing. I messaged an abortion hotline, and they said it would be safe to take the other dose of four misoprotol. So I did, 25 hours after the first dose. These also took a long time to dissolve, and I think some got pushed out with the blood. I am only having to change a regular thin pad once a day, which is about normal for a period for me, but so much less than I expected for this. \n\nI am not running a fever, but I am experiencing hot flashes on and off. I am still having some nausea, although I think it is decreased. Still more nausea persisting than last time, although this could be anxiety. Breat tenderness is not as prevalent, but still pretty present .Nipples are still slightly enlarged. I am also suffering from a constant, dull headache.  \n\nI took the first pill roughly 53 hours ago. I am constantly bleeding, just not as much as I expected and a different color. I do not feel the same relief and the pregnancy symptoms are not receding as fast as before, again though, I suppose it could be anxiety.  \n\nI financially cannot afford surgical abortion or a doctor's visit, as I am uninsured. I know if it is an emergency I have no choice, I'm just hoping I do not need to go into more debt. \n\nWhat was your experience? Do you think I should order from Aid Access again? I could try again in a week or so when the next set would arrive if this is failing, I'd be in the 6 week range by then. That's truly about all I can afford. \n\nI am so scared it is not working. I am not ready emotionally, financially or physically, I tried to be so careful. I hope someone here has had a similar experience so I at least have an idea of what to expect. My anxiety is through the roof.",

But let me tell you, I had my first child a month after I turned 22, and it was SO tough. It gets easier and you absolutely find a way to make it work for your baby, but there were so many moments were I felt so hopeless. We are in such a better space financially now, but we still have so much more growing to do! Don\u2019t let your emotions hold you back from an abortion if you are truly not sure you are willing to give up your 20\u2019s to have a baby. That is something I still struggle with is seeing all my friends my age being able to go out and have fun whenever wherever. And that is not the case for me.

              "body": "TL;DR -- You are not dumb. You are wise and wonderful. Trust yourself. \n\nFirst of all -- most important -- I celebrate that you and your partner have found each other. A loving, healthy relationship is a beautiful thing in this world, and I wish you a lifetime of mutual respect and kind gestures between you.\n\nAnd I celebrate your self-awareness in a society that overly romanticizes having babies. It's wonderful that you know yourself and respect your own wants and needs, rather than being manipulated by the opinions and agendas of others.\n\nHere's a fact that most of the world does not know -- It's really incredibly common to have more than one accidental pregnancy and more than one abortion over our three-plus decades of fertility.  And there is no fairness about our reproduction -- some people are very fertile and try so hard to prevent pregnancy, but get pregnant anyway. Others desperately want to be pregnant and have trouble conceiving.\n\nGetting pregnant is not a mistake. Pregnancies are not shameful. Pregnancy is an inevitable phenomenon in nature, driven by primal biology.\n\nThe only reason we have shame is because the world has been dominated by men for centuries, and their opinions and agendas have been drummed into our heads from childhood. They don't even have periods -- they have no clue about any of it. They are not authentic authorities.  I tend to carry on, so I will try to stop myself. But just think of all the double standards about our bodies, our sexuality and our reproduction.\n\nIt's a very, very, very rare thing to  see a man in this forum (or anywhere) shaming themselves for all of the accidental pregnancies they cause.\n\nNo one is dumb for getting pregnant. So many people spend their whole lives using all kinds of contraceptive methods and still get pregnant. All of the methods have failure rates that are higher than we are told. (Why are we not told? I think it comes down to money, as well as the fact that a lot of anti-abortion people are powerful in the realm of contraceptive production and marketing.) I  will stop myself from ranting, but here's an article that sheds light on the unfair burdens and challenges we face: [https://www.2plusabortions.com/why-people-have-abortions](https://www.2plusabortions.com/why-people-have-abortions)\n\nAlso, that website -- [https://www.2plusabortions.com/](https://www.2plusabortions.com/) \\-- has hundreds and hundreds of stories of people who've had more than one abortion. Maybe you can read some of them to help you see that you are definitely not alone.\n\nI understand you when you say you do not want to have another abortion. Abortions carry undeserved shame (see above about men:) But here is the actual truth:  abortions are merciful healthcare, and millions and millions of people have abortions because pregnant people have a deep inner wisdom about what is truly best.\n\nWhat is really best for people who have abortions? Preventing the tragedy of continuing accidental pregnancies that they know deep down they are not ready for and do not want -- continuing them just to avoid  -- unjustified -- guilt and shame.\n\nNine months of pregnancy is no picnic, giving birth carries health risks, and parenting is an around-the-clock, around-the calendar job that is exceedingly hard to do well (see divorce rates, see domestic violence statistics . . .)\n\nAnyway, I know all of this sounds like a rant and I apologize for carrying on. Here's the thing -- it hurts my heart so much to see all of the suffering people go through when they are being thoughtful, and wise, and loving around doing their best to manage their own reproduction.\n\nI suffered a lot -- and that is what I regret: all of the time I wasted in buying into the societal shame. I was younger than you when I got pregnant, and I didn't have anyone to help me see that the shame is unjustified. That is why I am here with you now, pouring out my heart and writing way too many words:)\n\nI hope you will learn now, not later, that you are 100 percent, through and through, worthy and deserving of love, respect, care, admiration and gratitude for following you inner wisdom rather than being harmed by (what I consider to be) the cruel emotional violence of shame.\n\nI send endless love and hugs to you and everyone who has abortions.",

Your story really resonates with me though. \n\nI had multiple abortions as a teenager and allowed them to play a huge role in warping my self image. I\u2019m now married and have two kids. Sometimes I look back at that version of myself with so much gratitude because I wasn\u2019t ready. I was raised in poverty and I wanted more out of life. \n\nI went forward with a pregnancy at 19 because of shame and guilt from being back there again despite not wanting to have a baby. She\u2019s 8 now and I love her but our relationship has been difficult for me and love can only do so much. We\u2019re in a good place now but it took a lot of therapy and being intentional with my actions because that \u201cmaternal instinct\u201d never happened for me.\n\nI look at the differences between my two children, the one planned for and the one I carried because shame told me to, and the contrast is drastic. \n\nIf by some chance you decide you *want* to have a baby, listen to that. But right now all I read it that you really don\u2019t, so listen to that. You\u2019re not dumb, many people have more than one abortion. Abortions don\u2019t have to be limited only to teenagers, those in bad relationships or poor social situations. People in healthy, loving relationships with all of the stability in the world still choose abortion. People who want children have abortions. People who already have children have abortions. Sometimes the time isn\u2019t right, for others there will never be a right time. Some people don\u2019t want children. \n\nThis is your choice and no one else\u2019s.

My provider gave me 6 mifepristones, 6 misoprostol/cytotec and 4 methergine.\n\nMy provider gave me step by step, detailed instructions and procedures. I have done everything. Including the aftercare, the tips and guides to make the abortion pass quickly.\n\nHowever, 24 hours has passed (as I'm currently writing this) abortion isn't complete. I've only pass small clots and tissues but not the fetus itself.\n\nI'm still experiencing painful cramps which wouldn't go away even after taking ibuprofen/advil as painkillers. I've done hot compress, drink warm liquids and massaging but still, cramps are painful.\n\nAny tips please??? This is my first time posting on reddit and my first time having medical abortion.\n\nEdit: Before taking medical abortion, I can feel the baby move. However, after taking medical abortion, I don't feel any movements at all as in 0%.",

I had minimal pain I did take painkillers before hand but worst pain was probably 4/10 and that only lasted for 5 minutes. I bled lightly that night, then more over the last 2 days. Not lost any big clots just some small ones but bleeding is heavier now still not speaking pads though just like a regular period. Feeling fine in myself, I have a scan on Monday to check everything is ok. Will let you all know! \n\nThank you so much for the support can\u2019t explain how much it helped you are all amazing people \u2764\ufe0f",

Also, I thought I could push through the nausea, which I did for a few hours until a wave of pain hit me and I got sick. It only happened one time for me, and my physician said that was perfectly normal due to the medication. I'm not sure if taking more pain meds would have helped, but they did say being hydrated and eating when instructed should. Try to eat what you can before you feel nauseous and stay hydrated no matter what... I think I was dehydrated on top of the medication... So if that does happen, know it's okay, but maybe that may help avoid it. If the pain gets bad I would look up how to alternate between ibuprofen and acetaminophen, my mom did that growing up when we had a fever and my doctor did recommend it in this case as well to tolerate pain. I'm not a doctor so I would recommend asking yours how to do this if you have not or looking it up on a credible resource (I do not want to cause any issues or risk anything for anyone), but alternating between the two helps lower the pain without risk of overdosing on those medications. If you don't want to do that totally fine just thought I would throw it out there! If you need anything my DMs are open. I went through this last weekend, you're not alone. I still have cramps a few days after with my uterus getting back to \"normal\" so they say, so I'm right here with you. It's scary, but hopefully the hardest part is over in a few hours. \u2764\ufe0f",

When I went through my first one it felt like very strong cramps along with bleeding. This lasted for about 40 minutes. Afterwards I was fine, minus some heavy bleeding. \nIf your doctor prescribed you some over the counter pain meds, use them! Ibuprofen can also help. I also used a heating pad on the highest setting and kept it between my legs. This helped so much with the pain and the cramps. I promise it is tolerable. Make sure you are in a comfortable space. I chose to sit on the toilet while I passed the pregnancy, then I made myself a soft area with towels on my couch in case I bled through. I also recommend grabbing boxers or disposable overnight adult diapers. Wearing tight underwear may cause discomfort. Be sure to allow your body lots of rest. Have snacks on hand.

My spouse rubbed my lower back and my tummy and laid beside me.

There are so many people on this sub who've been where you are. You're going to be okay <3\n\nRegarding what to expect, everybody's bodies respond a little differently. That said, there's a \"read MA/SA stories\" link at the top of this sub that has a really wide range of people's experiences. Going through some of those will help you see the spectrum of experience. It can be really emotionally challenging for some people \u2014 and some people say the anxiety leading up to it was worse than the process itself. Again, everyone's different.\n\nCertain items can help with the most common symptoms, which include bleeding and cramping that may be more intense than a typical period. Over-the-counter pain medication and heating pads can help with cramping pains. HowToUseAbortionPill.org's [instructions](https://www.howtouseabortionpill.org/howto/) cover how and when to take pain meds like ibuprofen. Some people also alternate taking ibuprofen and Tylenol every 6-8 hours and find that works even better for the pain.\n\nSome people may also experience nausea, but over-the-counter anti-nausea medications like Benadryl or Dramamine can help. So can eating light snacks (like crackers) and drinking lots of water. \n\nThere's no telling exactly what you may experience, but it's always a good idea to be prepared. Do you have a friend, family member, or other support person you can talk to while you're going through the process? [All-Options](https://www.all-options.org/find-support/talkline/) is also a really wonderful hotline you can call to talk to a nonjudgmental peer counselor about what you're feeling.\n\nYou can do this. And everyone in this sub is cheering you on :)",

Had cramps and bleeding for a few days after, but it got better. Naproxennatrium and ibuprofen helped me with the cramps. It took a few weeks for my hormones to go back to \"normal\", so at first I still had a little belly and bigger boobs and emotionally I still \"felt\" pregnant. That was the difficult part for me. And it took some time, but I'm starting to feel hopeful and optimistic about my life and future again. So will you darling. You will be okay",

As far as I\u2019ve heard, an MA at 4-5 weeks is very early so there\u2019s a chance of lesser bleeding compared to MAs farther in. Of course, all bodies react differently, but for sure since it\u2019s still early the clots and tissues that need to be passed aren\u2019t as big yet.",

My pill experience at 11 weeks: took first pill on a Friday so the second one I took on Sunday morning. 100% recommend doing it in the morning so you can rest at night. Cramps were heavy and bleeding began literally as soon as the 30 mins with the pill between my gums finished. Heavy bleeding and clots passed by which is Normal. What no one tells you is that around the 5th day after the actual procedure the cramps come back and they are strong. Bleeding continues for a couple of weeks but decreases to where it\u2019s spotting. One of my friends had a surgical at 14 weeks. She barely felt cramps and barely bled. Literally a couple of days. Wish you the best!",

We may be able to share more if you tell us what country you are in.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to be nervous. Medical care can be scary. \u2764\ufe0f",

Just do whatever is right for you and your future OP, no one knows fully what your going through apart from you, and don't let anyone tell you your doing anything wrong cos your not. I can't help with the procedure so much, I was 14w6 but had a SA under full sedation I was completely out for the operation. I've never heard of being medically induced the way you're describing but I wouldn't have wanted to do it either isn't there any other options? I'd definitely recommend going to sleep if you can. Was painless and I don't remember it at all. Hopefully my experience may help you a bit anyway? Best of luck we are with you x\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/zef1j8/a_message_of_hope_for_anyone_struggling_3/",

I told my boyfriend, and at first he pretended to be excited, but then flipped a switch last sunday. He started to get distant. \n\nThe thing is, he told me he didn't want me to take the plan b, he told me he was ready to start a family, he told me he wanted to be the stepfather of my already existing 2 year old. I took the plan b anyways because I didn't know if I could trust him, but the plan b ended up not working.\n\nHe conveniently broke up with me this morning, a day before the abortion is scheduled. He is basically ghosting me, acting like I haven't been texting him begging for support and asking why he had to lie to me. He lied about everything. He got me pregnant and told me he wanted to start a family, but he literally ran for the hills and I haven't heard a word from him. \n\nI already have one babydaddy, I don't want another. He had me fully convinced he was going to stick around, I'm so hurt and confused. I don't even want this abortion, he was insisting all week I get one because \"he's only 22, he's not ready\". He even claimed I was lying to him, that I didn't really have the abortion scheduled just because I've been sobbing every day nonstop, telling him I want the baby and I want to make it work.\n\nI want the baby. I know I'm going to regret this. I know I can't afford to be a single\nmother of two children, I can barely make it by myself with just one. I know I can't have this baby without his support. I'm so fucking heartbroken and lost, I don't know what to do. I know what's right, but I also can't stop crying. I can't stop thinking about what the baby will look like, what the gender will be, how good it could end up if I have the baby. \n\nI'm okay being a single mom, i have been, but I just can't afford it by myself. I want the baby so bad. There hasn't been one moment where I have not wanted the baby. I just know I can't. Someone please reassure me that it will be okay. I have anxiety about the pill, about the fact that I know the blood coming out of me will be a fetus and not just a regular period. Please someone help me, I am alone\n\nEdit: I went through with it. The doctor's appointment took hours because I couldn't stop crying. The doctor handed me the pill, and I got choked up and took awhile to take it. Every time I tried to put it in my mouth, I couldn't. When I finally did, it was such a bad feeling. I know I'm at the point of no return, but I made the right choice. I am very sad about it still, but hopefully tomorrow the bleeding and pain isn't worse than labor. Thank you everyone for your supporting comments, I appreciated them all. Hopefully I can move past all this one day and accept it for what it is and not what it couldve been.",

              "body": "What helped me was being curious to learn more about how I came to believe abortions are bad. This will be different for everyone, but here's how it has been for me:\n\nI reflected on my entire upbringing, and how it involved being raised to never doubt authority, but to always doubt myself.\n\nI explored all of the 'authorities' in this world who have opinions about abortions. I finally saw with intense clarity what is always in plain sight: through history, the 'authorities' on our reproductive lives have been men -- people who don't experience periods, pregnancies, miscarriages, abortions, or births in their own bodies.\n\nIn terms of religion, I thought a lot about how women's voices are absent from holy books and churches. In Christianity, the bible explicitly says women must be silent in church. How different would everything be if women's experiences and voices had been welcomed instead of erased and shamed.\n\nI realized all I had been taught, and all the shame I felt, had been manufactured and pumped into culture by people who don't even know what it is like to have a pregnancy at the wrong time and in the wrong context.\n\nI also learned that in the medical field, miscarriages are called spontaneous abortions. This was a radical realization for me. I spent a lot of time thinking about this, about why the body releases pregnancies on its own, and also about why I and so many other people choose to have abortions.\n\nI came to understand that miscarriages are when something is not right or healthy inside the body, so the body in its wisdom releases the pregnancy. And very much the same thing happens in abortions, but it has to do with what is going on outside the body in people's lives. Abortions are when something is not right or healthy outside the body, and the body's brain in its wisdom makes the decision to end the pregnancy.\n\nSo many accidental or problematic pregnancies occur at times and in situations that are unhealthy for creating and raising new people, and I believe people who get pregnant have an instinctive knowledge about this. And because they are good people, caring people, loving people -- they do not want to bring a new person into the world to suffer and struggle.\n\nThis instinctive knowledge that we have in our own bodies and in our own minds -- we are taught to distrust it. We are taught to believe outside 'authorities' instead.\n\nFinally, what also helped me was simply spending a lot of time immersing myself in other people's abortion stories at trusted websites -- platforms that had no agenda other than to share people's authentic experiences. I've now spent several years reading people's stories and listening to them:\n\nOver time, I listened to every single recording at The Abortion Diary: [https://www.theabortiondiary.com/](https://www.theabortiondiary.com/)\n\nI read hundreds and hundreds of stories at Shout Your Abortion: [https://shoutyourabortion.com/](https://shoutyourabortion.com/)\n\nI read stories from people dealing with the most extreme stigmas at 2+ Abortions Worldwide:  [https://www.2plusabortions.com/](https://www.2plusabortions.com/)\n\nGetting to know people through their own words, through their own stories, simply has filled me with unspeakable love and compassion for all of us who have bodies that can reproduce. The world is so unkind to us, and we endure so much cruelty, gaslighting and abuse.\n\nBut the worst part -- what breaks my heart the most -- is that this world teaches us to shame ourselves, encourages us to be so hard on ourselves, pushes us to believe the worst of ourselves.\n\nWhat is needed is more love, respect and trust for ourselves and for all people with the capacity to reproduce. I am out here sending you love and respect, and may you become the creator of peace in your own mind and heart, because that is what you deserve.",

The brainwashing, the propaganda they were feeding me from the earliest days. Understanding that to them I've had value only if i was a good girl and experiencd no unapproved thoughts and feelings. That i and my sisters were worth less than a cluster of cells without feelings - because fetuses can't feel pain and have no emotions and no personality. Women do, but they have worth only if they serve and breed. \n\nThen i looked into my family and realized that in a catholic country i wouldn't be here, and neither would my sister as my mother wouldn't have received help in her ectopic pregnancy and then when her first real pregnancy died and she could get abortion. That was in the communist Poland, in current Poland my mother would be dead. \n\nThen i reached out to women shelters, my mom was a social worker, and i noticed that actual help is given to women by so called feminazis and other leftist organisations. Church-run charities were focused on forcing women back into submission, not empowering them. \n\nThen i got pregnant and i didn't want to be. I was expecting that i will be grieving, that i will be eternally sad, that i will think badly about me. But none of those feelings came. I felt only relief. So i tried forcing myself into those feelings which sent me down for a while. But then i realized how sick it is. How sick it is that i am forcing myself to hate myself just because I've made the best decision i could. The moment i realized it, sitting on the sunny balcony with a coffee and a cigarette was the moment i became free. \n\nI wish such moment will come onto you. In a meanwhile start reading up on pro choice publications and avoid any exposure to religion. Oh, you may start as well reading some things about the manipulation of religion.",

I know that sounds sappy, but if it's a known pain point, can't hurt to prepare the comfort ahead. \n\nI think it would be EPIC support if you clean the bathroom before she takes the pills because she might have to hang out there a while, and a shiny clean space to labor will be both noticed and appreciated.  Even if she does just poop in it for a couple hours!  You could clean even more of the home, too, if you have the time to.  Not all women are like this, but many feel more relaxed in a clean space, and relaxation helps ease some of the pain of this physical experience in the body.\n\nHeating pads, comfortable couch situation, comfort food, and just a lot of patience.  If she snaps don't take it to heart, it's just hard feelings gone sideways. It isn't about you.  Some women are going to want to be held, and other women aren't going to want to be touched.  That's just the instincts that go with labor in her body, and she can't know what she'll want that way until she's in it. Wise of you to acknowledge that she may want space or she may want active comforting. \n\nOne thing a lot of guys have a hard time with is seeing their girl in pain or sadness and not being able to fix it.  I love that you're here to help -- you're ABSOLUTELY going to help just by being there and doing this background research and by creating an nice space.  But there will come a point where you can't actually make it better.  It might be her guilt or shame or sadness or it might be the intensity of her cramping.  Whatever it is, if you can just witness her in that pain, that's all a lot of women want.  Obviously, if she redirects you, her direction is more important than mine!  But to witness, you just have to be able to tolerate being close to her pain even as you can not make it better and basically resting in that discomfort.  It ain't easy for her to feel sad and depressed and to labor a miscarriage at home like this, and it ain't easy for you to just sit by and watch her, but I have this feeling that you're up to it. \n\nBest wishes and so much support to you both.",

I took this opportunity to learn as much as I can, as the women in the waiting room were just as scared as me. I also found out a crucial piece of medical practice that blew my mind. In all 50 states a pelvic exam has to be consensual. I was informed by my gynecologist (that preforms the abortion and has been for decades) that most will not ask you for consent they\u2019ll will just have you drop your pants. He explained \u201cmost of the time a pelvic exam on a women is unnecessary so asking consent makes me, a medical professional feel more involved\u201d. I was educated in multiple scenarios. That of course was a huge eye opener and I decided to deep dive in the world of women health. Being educated made this journey a whole lot easier.

And you are doing the right thing in taking care of your mental and emotional health, reaching out for help from a therapist. \n\nHaving an accidental pregnancy is so hard and unfair as it is, but a pregnancy of twins must feel like double the difficulty -- twice the intensity of the physical and emotional hardships. \n\nIt's so strange that an IUD -- a merciful invention that helps people avoid accidental pregnancies -- is frowned upon for anyone of any reproductive age. This just shines a light on the cruel shame and stigma around everything to do with us -- our bodies, our sexuality, our periods, our reproduction. The unjustified shame -- most of it created by men who have dominated culture through history -- is the most tragic aspect of our reproductive lives. \n\nBut I won't get started on that, or I will never stop . . . :) \n\nI hope you are no longer physically ill from the guilt. There should be no guilt around any of our reproductive experiences -- they all are human, and normal, and natural. And so much of it is out of our control -- even people who use contraceptives 'perfectly' can still get pregnant. It's so unfair. \n\nIt's truly beautiful that you are not letting your painful experience continue to hurt you, but instead you are transforming all you've been through into acts of loving kindness toward others.

You can learn more about that here, so you don't feel like you did anything wrong: [2plusabortions.com/why-people-have-abortions](https://2plusabortions.com/why-people-have-abortions)\n\nIt's also so unfair that you have to travel out of state to get basic, normal, common reproductive healthcare. Anti-abortion politicians are the worst, but I won't get started down that road or I'll never stop . . . \n\nI really admire you -- you know that you are not ready to go through pregnancy and take on the risks of childbirth and the lifelong responsibility of raising a baby into adulthood. You are trusting your own wisdom, and that is very hard to do in this world of unjustified shaming messages.\n\nIt's understandable that you feel alone. For one thing, there's so much silence around all of our reproductive experiences, but especially abortions. It's hard to know who would be supportive. Also, even when people are supportive, they truly cannot know what it's like to be pregnant at the wrong time and in the wrong circumstances, and they truly cannot know what it's like to end a pregnancy,\n\nHaving an in-clinic abortion is safe and quick. Well, the procedure itself takes about 5 minutes, but like any other healthcare, there's a lot of waiting, filling out forms etc. Many people go back to work very soon, so you can see how you feel. \n\nIf you want someone to talk to, you can call the All-Options Talk Line to speak with a nonjudgmental counselor for free: [https://www.all-options.org/find-support/talkline/](https://www.all-options.org/find-support/talkline/)\n\nAlso here's a really great zine that has all kinds of supportive information and tips.

I'm glad I was able to take a few days off work to rest in bed before I had to be on my feet again. I could have worked at a desk 1 day later but couldn't walk far or fast for 3 days (and I'm otherwise fit).  \n\nWishing you smooth procedure and so much self-love and self-forgiveness.  This is not your fault.",

I know I should've kept my legs closed but I did take protective measures to try to prevent it. I feel like everyone knows when they look at me. I feel so alone and there's no one I can really talk about this with. I feel as if I'm making the right decision at the time. Maybe one day once I'm more stable financially and mentally I'll consider starting a family but for now I'm positive I don't want to. What does it feel like? They said they would have to do the vacuum. When should I go back to work? What kind of things will I need to comfort the pain I'm going to most likely have?",

The entire procedure took less than 5 minutes. I was immediately able to get up and walk out of the door and drive home too when it was done. It was awesome. The ladies working there in the clinic were awesome. The doctor was so sweet and awesome. I was terrified of the pain, but please don\u2019t be scared. It\u2019s such a simple procedure and turned out to not be super painful at all, you will be good I promise.

So thanks for listening and anything you want to share.\n\nI'm in my 30s and have kids between ages 8 and 12. I have a decent professional career that supports us. This pregnancy was completely unexpected and to make matters worse as well as pretty much decide it, I developed severe hyperemesis gravidarum and lost 31 lb in less than 6 weeks. At first thought it was just a virus. Was sleeping on the bathroom floor to be closer to the toilet etc, became anemic, dehydrated..... Finally lost consciousness one night, went to doctor and they said I was pregnant and it was hyperemesis the whole time. I was sent home with nausea meds that didn't work and missed over a week of paid work with being ill and the multiple day appointment forced on me for 5 pills and a Zofran. The white male lawmakers of my state added the fun twist of me being forced repeatedly to sign things like \"I don't want to see my baby\" on the ultrasound, and \"I understand this will terminate the pregnancy and end the baby's life\". \n\nLike at this point, I guess it feels like trauma around a major medical scare than anything because of how sick I was before I was finally able to get my abortion. I feel sad and pissed women are treated this way getting needed care.  I feel nothing but relief for myself with the decision right now, truly though. I am gaining weight back slowly and able to work. Able to eat which is amazing after all the nausea. And yet..... I do fear telling people I know about it. I know I don't have to and I may never. But I know how people think about it especially around here- BUT also hate to contribute to stigma. \n\nI don't know.. Thanks for reading this rambling.

It took me time to understand that I was the only one who holds the power over how I will choose to think about myself and the experiences in my life.\n\nWe really have so little control over anything in this world, but we do have control over our mind and how we will talk to ourselves, how we will treat ourselves. \n\nOver time I also realized that punishing myself was actually the most selfish act of all, because it prevented me from showing up in my life with healthy and authentic love for others. I was too busy beating myself up to be there for others. \n\nI realize these things are easy for me to say. And I know words are very shallow when the pain is so deep. But please never give up on efforts to be kinder to yourself. It takes time and practice, just like anything else worth doing.\n\nThis world can be such a mean place. It is in desperate need of so much more tenderness and kindness. The place to begin is inside of yourself, in your own mind. \n\nWe cannot change the past, but we do have power over how to create the rest of our lives.

And it's deeply unfair, that this world does not pour all of its money and resources into helping people thrive so that they can have the families they want so desperately.\n\nAnd you are right -- a lot of people do try to make it work. They carry on with accidental pregnancies against their inner wisdom and do their best, but so often it leads to misery, suffering, abuse, lifelong struggle and pain.\n\nBut I hear you and see you. You are a loving person, a deeply caring person, and it goes against every fiber of your being to have ended those pregnancies. And you wish so much you had been in a position to keep those pregnancies and love those babies and raise them and nurture them in a secure home with stability and money enough for all the needs.\n\nAnd maybe you wished for miscarriages, so you would not have had to make those decisions to stop those pregnancies from developing.\n\nBut I am here to tell you that what you did were truly acts of merciful mothering. You knew, deep down, that you were not ready to take on the risks of nine months of pregnancy, the risks of childbirth and the forever responsibility of raising new human beings from infancy into adulthood.\n\nYou heard and trusted your inner wisdom, and you broke your own heart, and you took on the hardship of grief, as you let go of those pregnancies to avoid creating more suffering in a world already overflowing with suffering. There is nothing more noble and generous and selfless and loving as that.\n\nYou deserve so much respect, care, compassion, and support. And this is true for everyone who ends a pregnancy, no matter how many, no matter how far along, no matter the reasons.  The only reason this world is so heartless toward us is that it has always been run by men, and men never have the actual lived experiences of pregnancies in their own bodies. They have no idea how much it hurts to be pregnant at the wrong time. They have no idea how much it hurts to end a pregnancy you really want to keep.\n\nYou want your babies back, and you want to be their mother. I hear you and I understand. And the longing that you feel is so real, and so painful. My heart is with you. And what this proves is that you are such a loving, caring, big-hearted, beautiful human being. Feeling as you do just reveals that your heart is so beautiful and tender and loving. And this world needs you and your beautiful heart.\n\nThis is a lot of words, too many words, and I apologize that I can go on so long.\n\nYou don't want advice, and that's good because I don't have any advice to give that would help ease the deep pain you are feeling. From reading what you have shared, I have faith that you will find your way because you will be guided by your beautiful heart.\n\nI have faith that you will honor the babies you had to let go of, by carrying on with courage despite the grief you will always carry. I believe you will not let their loss add to the suffering in this world, and instead you will add to the love in this world, in order to bring dignity to their memory.\n\nThis is not easy to do, but you are a strong person who has endured so much unfairness. You have survived every hard thing so far, and that means you will endure.\n\nYou are not alone in ending more than one pregnancy. It's very common. Millions of other people have experienced the brutal unfairness of pregnancies at the wrong time , and the hard choice of abortions, more than once in their lifetime. See their stories and hear their voices and know that every single one deserves love, respect, compassion and care, just as you deserve these, too.  [2plusabortions.com](https://2plusabortions.com)\n\nThis little love letter cannot do much to ease your pain, but please know it is from my heart to yours and just think of it as a warm hug of comfort in a cold world.\n\nAnd I cannot sign off without giving advice: Love yourself, and talk kindly to yourself, because that is what you deserve.",

I see you putting yourself down a lot in this post, so I'll just say: you are not a bad person and, even if you would not make the same decision again today, the you who made your previous choices had their reasons. The you who chose to have abortions is a great, thoughtful person, and the you who is experiencing this grief right now is, too -- this shows a lot in your insightful words at the end of your post about what's happening with abortion politically right now. (But, it's also okay to avoid news and social media as much as you can if it's triggering for you!) Try to remember that you deserve self-compassion and love, even if abortion isn't a choice you'd make again today, because you do. \ud83d\udc95\n\nI know you mention not wanting counseling, but if you want something short term where you could vent for a bit, [All-Options Talkline](https://www.all-options.org/find-support/talkline/) and [Exhale Pro-Voice](https://exhaleprovoice.org/) are great options. These are hotlines with trained, pro-choice support staff. Wishing you lots of peace!",

I keep running through the reasons in my head, and now they all seem like things people who become pregnant figure out. Finances? Get a second job. Still in school? Find a babysitter. Unsupportive family? Who cares. I guess I just feel like shit and I\u2019m a walking ball of anxiety ever since I had a second abortion. The first one fucked me up enough but now I really feel like I\u2019ll never move on from this. A permanent void - in my heart forever, and I\u2019ve accepted it. So I guess it\u2019s okay. A part of me died with my two fetuses. Is this type of regret, guilt, and depression normal? I knew that I had to abort them, but I didn\u2019t want to and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving me crazy. I\u2019ve always wanted to be a mom. I had the chance twice and threw it away, like the piece of shit that I am. I don\u2019t want counseling. I don\u2019t want another pregnancy. I want mine back that I already had. Two of them. I think about them everyday. If they were a boy or girl, or what they\u2019d look like. What their skin would feel like against mine. What their laughs would sound like. I guess I\u2019ll never know. I look up to the sky sometimes (hoping that they\u2019re in heaven) and I apologize for what I did to them. I just feel like I\u2019m a changed person after having two abortions. This has been the most difficult thing to deal with in my life, and it enrages me to keep hearing about abortion in the news, on TikTok, in voting poll ads. Why the fuck is it anyone\u2019s business or say? Abortion can be traumatizing for so many including myself, and here are rich old white men on the news putting in their two cents. Don\u2019t forget the ones outside planned parenthood trying to convince you to keep your baby - as if they could ever even begin to imagine what this fucking feels like.",

I already have a 6 yr old son and his father started coming around, I have no interest in my sons father but my current feels that he is trying to win me back. I don\u2019t see how, I honestly just feel like he just wants to build a relationship with his son. My sons father told me he was not ready to be a father and I knew I\u2019d be a single mother, at the time I did not agree with abortions and decided to keep my son anyways. After dealing with the stress of single mother hood I have a different point of view. My current doesn\u2019t want me on social media, dressing a certain way or interacting with any men that aren\u2019t him or my brothers and dad. He\u2019s made me cut off all my male friends because he cut off his female friends and says I am disrespecting him for even liking a post on social media. He has three phones and is always texting but has a problem if I am on my phone for more than 10 minutes. \n\nI do dress a bit provocatively so I did throw/give away those things, and I do have a problem with escapism when I am stressed out I stress scroll on the phone. But it has gotten to a point where I can\u2019t even have a different opinion than him because he feels that I am combating him. He constantly tells me about how so many women want him but the second I talk about ANY man in my life he gets mad. I am 29 and he is 37. He says that I am the problem because he has only had 4 relationships in his life (but he has a lot of casual sex and admitted that a woman has to play the role of his girl friend for 6 months before he claims them) and I\u2019ve had 4 relationships including him in the past 10 years. I don\u2019t do casual sex and he threw in my face that I\u2019ve been abused because I am the problem (I have restraining orders on 2 exes because of stalking and death threats and one of them was extremely verbally abusive). \n\nHe\u2019s a vegan and wants me to follow suite, I cannot eat the amount of food or what I want to eat because he will get mad and say I\u2019m going to give myself stomach issues.. I\u2019ve lost 20 lbs in a month while pregnant and I have dreams almost every day that I am going to die. That has made me very depressed along with feeling like I am losing my freedom to be myself. Somehow, and for some reason, he wants me to stay pregnant with his child even though he told me I disgust him and that he was never going to get back with me. I told him I will not have a baby with another man unless we are getting married and staying together. I don\u2019t want to deal with two men that are going to be free to do what they want while I am stuck raising children by myself. He currently lives in LA and I live in New England area so he wouldn\u2019t even be around. \n\nEverything was perfectly fine until I started voicing my opinion and telling him how I started to feel like this relationship is getting a bit controlling. I do have online classes so he thinks I am only on social media when I am on the phone or computer.  I have no social life because he has isolated me from everyone even my family- but he does not understand why I want to get an abortion. When I told him about it he just told me that another man probably paid for it and called me a hoe and blocked me. \n\nThere\u2019s no history of either one of us cheating, at least that I know of- and he did not put his hands on me or argue in front of my son. Which I can appreciate but I still am hurt because I usually don\u2019t agree with abortion but I feel like for my future and safety this is what I have to do. I guess I just need some advice on the situation because I have been so depressed lately. I have my appointment on Friday for the procedure. I\u2019m just hurt I guess and have no one to talk to about this situation. Am I wrong for this? Was there something I could have done differently? What can I do to cope with the stress? I\u2019ve never been so heart broken before and these feelings are so new to me.",

I never told anyone at the time who the father was or how it happened and people assumed it was my ex boyfriend who was 16.\n\nI have been working through the rape in trauma therapy and it's brought up a lot of feelings about the abortion that I had shoved down.  I had my abortion in 1998, and was treated by the nurse like a bad girl, who had been sent to Miss Prim's School for Wayward Teens in shame.  Although it was a medical abortion, I had to stay in the hospital as a day patient, and I was placed in a room near the maternity ward.\n\nThe memories I'm stuck on are that when I must have cried out in pain (because I hadn't been given any painkillers and was essentially having an induced miscarriage) that I was told to be quiet as people were trying to have their baby in the ward close by.  I was also denied any pain relief until very late in the procedure at which point I was given morphine.  Should either of those things happened the way they did?\n\nIs there anyone here that had an abortion back then, who was treated in a similar fashion?  I've read more recent accounts where people have been treated with care and compassion, which is wonderful, but I've carried such shame about my abortion all these years because all the grown ups in the situation treated me like I was being punished.\n\nI have had a great deal of distress over my periods, which has got worse as the years go by, I'm 41 now and have just been diagnosed with PCOS.  My periods trigger some kind of PTSD flashback from the abortion, and it's getting more intense as I work through the trauma therapy.  I know that's to be expected, but I just wondered if periods being a trigger after abortion was a thing.  I know it is for miscarriage, but I'm very much still trying to unravel that my abortion was nothing to feel ashamed of.\n\nThere was  no counselling or therapy offered or recommended after my procedure.  My parents and sister wouldn't talk to me about it, and my Mum used it as a weapon against me a couple of times.  I had to deal with close friends and family watching me like a hawk around babies, which made me feel so self conscious, as it just felt like an elephant in the room.  \n\nI ended up with such a phobia of getting pregnant that I ended up just deciding not to have kids, although I feel now that it was the right choice, despite the occasional thoughts about what my child would be like.\n\nWhat happened is a burden that I'd really like to put down, but I have been thinking a lot about the way that I was treated, and about how triggered I feel when I have a period.  I'd be grateful to know I'm not alone in this.",

An abortion is a chosen miscarriage -- something is not right outside the pregnant person's body in the context of their life, so the body's brain -- in its wisdom -- chooses to release the pregnancy. Whether chosen or not, pregnancy losses are profound and worthy of grief, and worthy of beautiful songs. Thank you for sharing!!",

You aren't bad or wrong for getting pregnant twice by accident, once without and once with birth control.  You're just a human being in her animal body, and we've evolved to reproduce and carry on the species.  You don't have to have babies just because evolution has set the ball rolling in the fertile direction.  You get to use the tools available to make your own best reproductive choices.  \n\nI hope you don't receive any judgment, but if you do, that's about THEM, not about you.",

It\u2019s less expensive and these people will mail pills into states even where mailing pills is not legal.  They do work outside of the legal medical framework in the US. There is some risk associated with it and less personal medical advice.\n\nSo, it\u2019s a risk benefit analysis for many people. If you can\u2019t easily get pills another way, and if you don\u2019t feel you need a great deal of medical support along the way, it can be a good option. \n\nAs for what you experience, you will need at least 24 hours after the second medication to feel better. Bleeding and cramping along with the possibility of chills nausea and even diarrhea are possible.\n\nThis site may be helpful to you: https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/the-abortion-pill",

I took a pregnancy test last night, came out positive, and according to pregnancy calculators online, I am 4 weeks along due to tge first day of my last cycle being 10/25/22..\n\nI purchased the RU486 package. I received a text from the company asking for the payment either via Cashapp or Venmo.\n\n Has anyone used this product from the company before? \n\nWere you nervous about it being legit or not despite seeing many say it is? \n\nHow long did it take to receive it? \n\nHow long did the effects of the medication last, was it severe enough for anyone else to notice, and did you have to call out of work due to excess bleeding or any other effect of the medication? \n\nOtherwise, I'm terrified and feel guilty but know it's not the right time for a baby right now. My now ex is supporting me but is just as sad and feels ashamed :(.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nUpdate:\n\nAs you can see in the comments, I've decided to take the pills I bought online instead of going to PP. I still have an appt w/ my gyno to do a US and decided to keep it so they can at least tell if I've expelled all the tissue.\n\nHere's a timeline of the meds I took today.\n\n-12/05/2022-\n\n8:33am - took mifepristone\n\n9:15am - slight cramping\n\n10:05am - slight nausea\n\n11:46am - mild cramping\n\n2:00pm - 2 500-mg acetaminophen, 2 benadryl, and thc oil.\n\n2:33pm - Misoprostol vaginally + wait 30 min before getting up (3:03pm)\n\n3:07pm - mild cramping and hiccups. 1 500-mg acetaminophen.\n\n3:49pm - hiccups resolved\n\n3:59pm - small amount of bleeding\n\n4:27pm - passed lemon sized blood clot \n\n4:50pm - passed another clot: size estimated to be about 1.5 lemons. Looked like placenta may have been attached since I saw part of the clot was long and extended to one of the sides of the clot. Still no cramps. \n\n5:12pm - more clots \n\n5:32pm - starting to feel mild cramping but nothing I haven't felt before during my period. More clots.\n\n6:44pm - more clots and no pain.\n\n7:32pm - clots getting smaller and still no pain.\n\nI assume the worst is over right now but I'll keep documenting as needed. I also set a stopwatch  and so far, 11 hrs have now passed as I am writing this since I took the first pill.\n\n12/06 \n5:33am - Light bleeding that's similar to the 1st or 4th day of my period. Nothing I haven't seen before. So, I think I'll stop updating here.\n\nThank you for reading and I pray this helps someone else \ud83d\udda4.",

You have been trying very hard to be supportive, but in the process you are hurting and feeling resentful. \n\nAbortions can impact relationships: Very often, accidental pregnancies and abortions do not cause relationship problems; they shine a spotlight on weaknesses in the relationship that already were there.  \n\nIt's important to remember that having a child and taking on the around-the-clock lifetime responsibility of raising a new human also puts a massive strain on a relationship. There are many divorces and broken relationships that involve children. Parenting is so much more difficult than society portrays it. It's best that both people be 100 percent willing, otherwise it is very unfair to the potential new human.\n\nPeople often talk about their own wants, but do not put at the center of consideration what is truly best for a potential new person. When a person continues a pregnancy they don't really want or are not fully ready for just to please a partner -- there are lifelong resentments that not only hurt the relationship between the partners, but cause hurt to the child.  A child deserves parents who are ready and willing to care for them with their whole heart. \n\nIt is healthy to grieve that your partner does not want to continue this pregnancy.

This is huge, what you're doing, and you're doing a really great job. \n\nI support couples across the grief of pregnancy loss, and my most basic advice is this: You have to cast a wide net.  As much as you and your GF are in this together in that it is happening to you both, you really CAN'T be all the way in it together, as you so well know.  What this means, is that sometimes you are the least capable people to support each other in this moment.  You both have massive and worthy needs right now, and they are very different.  I tell my couples to cast a wide net for support.  This means, call a friend and talk to your friend.  Get a therapist and get professional support from therapy. If you feel weird about therapy (some people just do) get a coach to help you integrate your own worthy feelings and to be there for profound witnessing and holding. Join a men's group or support group. \n\nWhen you do want to show up for your girlfriend, for instance, when you'll be together tomorrow, the best I have for you is this: hold yourself with so much kindness and generosity that it's ok to be present with her hard feelings without trying to fix them.  A very common dynamic in heterosexual relationship is that the woman wants to be witnessed and the man wants to make it better.  If you relieve yourself of the responsibility to fix your GF's feelings or this situation, and just allow yourself to feel what you feel and let your GF feel what she feels, that's often more than enough.  It is harder than it sounds.  Go so gently with yourself and with her.  You're both hurting right now.  When the situation is confusing and overwhelming, focus on the feelings in your body.  Just stay in your body.  \n\nI'm so sorry that it's like this.  I wish it were easier.  Holding you and your GF gently in your own individual needs and honoring both of your very worthy feelings.",

You don't need to because it's really none of our business. \n\nThose are the hard questions around relationships that, as others have expressed, you two need to work out, and preferably with the help of a therapist.\n\nThat said, abortion is neither easy, nor is it unbearable. \n\nThe nature of human biology is such that many pregnancies end in miscarriages; it's been posited that oftentimes \"late\" periods are due to an embryo not implanting for whatever reason (and there can be many).\n\nRarely do women willingly undergo terminations on a whim. Generally it's because she either never wanted to be a parent, or sees too many difficulties with becoming a parent *at this point in time.* \n\nVery few women express regret for the decision to abort, even if they are unhappy about the *necessity* for it, and grieve for the baby they were not ready to welcome into their life. \n\nIt's harder for you, as a man, because it is not your body doing the heavy lifting, even if you feel you are ready to become a father. And it is ok for you to grieve the baby you feel ready for, even if she is not.\n\nAgain, these are conversations you and your SO need to have with each other, not with strangers on the internet.

I'm still participating, in fact arranging everything myself. I bent over backwards to get her an appointment as she is still in the legalization process to live in my country, which made it a lot more difficult. Dozens of phone calls later and after visiting 3 health centers, the municipality and one hospital I finally got it. I went with her to the first appointment with the obstetrician. I paid for whatever fees there were to pay. I arranged for her to spend the next few days over and I'll be driving her to the hospital to take the first pill and I'll be staying at home with her when she takes the second one. There's no one else to do this with her and I don't know how she would've managed without me essentially taking up all the responsibilities and arranging everything.\n\nBut during the whole thing I'm just profoundly grieving and wishing she changes her mind last minute. I couldn't possibly abandon her but I hate everything I'm doing and I hate participating in this as I really want this baby (we both did in the beginning, as I said). On one hand I want to support her because this must be hard for her, there's no one else to do it and I love her. On the other hand I feel I need support myself and that I'm in no condition to be supportive. She has expressed the need to be by herself and I gave her space. And at the same time I'm feeling resentful because she knows I'm suffering a lot and I needed her to be there for me too. Maybe she isn't in a position to give that either and I can't demand it. But the fact remains that I'm continually repressing my feelings to force myself to support her through something I wholeheartedly hate all while I'm not getting what I need from her in this moment even tho we have talked about it extensively. She has barely talked to me these past 5 days while I'm being consumed by my thoughts and feelings by myself. And I've just shut up about it and let her be.\n\nTomorrow I'll be picking her up for her to come over and I'm feeling very worried and conflicted. On one hand I'm very hurt by the whole situation, by the fact she changed her mind about having the baby, by her pretty much leaving me alone with these feelings even tho I expressed the need for company and communication. On the other hand I need to be the one caring for her right now. I'll be the one accompanying her through the process, I should be the one providing her comfort in whatever way she needs, etc. I'm afraid my own feelings will prevent me from doing my part properly and turning the situation into something even worse than what it needs to be. In this moment I'm feeling intense grief, very intense regret for everything I've done and will need to do in the next few days, hopelessness, helplessness and lack of agency, resentment (and there's no point pontificating on how I have no right to feel it, I simply do and it's beyond my control), disconnection between us and abandonment. And this is not the emotional state I should be in while helping her through it. I'm afraid I'll either be overwhelmed by my feelings and make it all worse for her or, on the other hand, that I'll be capable of totally repressing how I feel just to be able to preform my part, definitely damaging myself further in the process, worsening the feelings of resentment in the future and probably destroying the chance of salvaging the relationship. Not to be a whiner, but holy shit do people underestimate how violent this experience can be for the father as well...\n\nI'm having a very hard time navigating this and there's not a lot of people I can turn to for support either. If you have any advice, please help me out. I very much dispense with scolding for feeling how I feel tho.",

I have nightmares all the time, and my bed makes me feel worse than the opposite since conception happened in my house and so did the abortion.\n\nEven when I try to get distracted my mind takes me back to the day of the abortion.

If you feel this is what you want and you can raise the child despite the circumstances, then you should do that. I'm just not sure I would make the decision purely on wanting to be a mother. Only because you will have plenty of time to do that.\n\nAgain, whatever you choose is the right decision. No one (reasonable) will blame you for what you felt is right. Just really think on it. You're only 6 weeks so you've got time. Make a pro and con list and really consider what is best for you and the fetus. Think about your goals in life too. \n\nWishing you luck and peace",

People think they are helping by giving their opinion, but in all fairness, it sometimes makes it that much more complicated. You are the one who has to live with whatever you decide, not them. I will say I had my first child at 19. I was still living at home with my parents, not in a great relationship with the father, working part time and going to college full time. It was HARD! But I did it. Was it the best thing for my son? No. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. He deserved better than what I was able to give him, but I wouldn't change how I handled the situation. We grew up together in a sense. \n\nFast forward 12 years, I'm 31 now. I'm engaged to a wonderful man. We both have great jobs and a lot of support. He had a vasectomy 10 years ago. We thought we were safe. I found out I was pregnant and had an abortion 3.5 weeks ago. I made that choice because I knew I couldn't give that baby the love and attention he or she deserved. I still have dreams and wishes to fulfill. \n\nSo after my long rant, what I'm trying to say is - you know your body and your situation best. Can you have the baby and raise him/her on your own? Absolutely. Can you give the baby up for adoption? Absolutely. Can you have an abortion? Absolutely. You just need to think about what the best decision is for YOU, not your boyfriend or sister or roommates.",

I did choose twilight sedation bc my anxiety is so bad. I\u2019m SO thankful I did. I did not feel or remember absolutely anything. As soon as they administered my IV, I felt a warm sensation, got a little dizzy, and felt a complete sense of relaxation. I remember the doctor coming and saying hi and I remember saying hi back, my eyes got heavy and I closed them and I do not remember anything else until the recovery room. The come down from the drugs were tolerable, I was a little woozy and dizzy but it wore of so quickly. Mind you, I do not drink or do any type of drugs either. So it was super tolerable. I had the best support team at my clinic and an amazing doctor. I am so beyond thankful. \n\nI know how lonely it can be without your families support.

He is the sweetest, most emotionally intelligent guy ever. I\u2019m on birth control, but missed two days over Halloween. I doubled up, took plan B, but\u2026 am obviously still pregnant.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize I was pregnant until two weeks ago when I went out with friends. I had one mixed drink and proceeded to violently puke. The week that followed was constant morning sickness, bloating, and crazy hunger. I wanted to get an abortion before going home for Christmas, but I was leaving in only a few days.\n\nI\u2019m home now and couldn\u2019t be more terrified. My mother is a staunch conservative Christian. She used to stand outside abortion clinics holding signs. She donates money to pro-life organizations. She is constantly talking about how pro-life is her one issue. She cries about it. \n\nHiding my pregnancy from her has been the hardest, most scary thing in my life. I have bloating, nausea, and gas from the moment I wake up til I fall asleep. I gained weight and am constantly starving. My eating pattern changed to exclude some of my favorite foods. My sense of smell is crazy now.\n\nI immediately tried to schedule an appointment when I got back home, but live in a rural area with only one option. It is all booked until mid January. I will be over 10 weeks when I finally get a surgical abortion. I am still figuring out how to pay for it, and it is breaking my heart that I won\u2019t be able to buy my family or friends gifts this year. \n\nNo one knows I\u2019m pregnant except one friend, who agreed to accompany me during it. I\u2019m so grateful for her. I so desperately want to tell my boyfriend, but he is over five hours away. I know he will drive up if I told him, and would pay for it, care for me, etc. but I feel so incredibly ashamed. \n\nWe already had an abortion talk when Roe v. Wade got overturned, so I know he supports my decision and is \u201cokay\u201d with being kept in the dark if it\u2019s what I want, but\u2026 I so badly just want a hug. I don\u2019t want to disrupt his Christmas and New Year\u2019s and a family trip, so am planning to tell him only a day or two before the abortion. But I just want to tell him now so bad.\n\nThe idea of living my life like this for the next four weeks is so overwhelming and disheartening. Hiding from my mother is exhausting me, especially when my symptoms are so bad. I wish I could have it taken care of now. I\u2019m terrified of getting the procedure done as I\u2019ve never had any kind of surgery. I\u2019ll also be over 10 weeks pregnant, which is less common, and that makes me so, so scared.\n\nAll I want is to enjoy Christmas and being home with my family, because I love them so much. The idea of being sick and scared makes me cry. \n\nIs there a Discord or equivalent where I can talk with people going through this? I just need to feel safe.\n\nTLDR; My abortion is still weeks away and I live in a household that is very pro-life. I have yet to tell my bf. Just feeling defeated.",

My partner (23M) & I have been together for just over 1 year & at first I was excited, because I know he\u2019s going to be an amazing dad, but our arguments are more magnified & I have to really knuckle down & think about if he\u2019s the person I want to spend the rest of my life raising this child with. \n\nI wasn\u2019t the type to always dream of becoming a mother. At one point in my life I decided I wasn\u2019t going to have kids. But finding out I\u2019m pregnant caught me off guard too. \n\nSince finding out I was pregnant, which is about a week now, I have seriously considered abortion about 3 times.  I have been researching like crazy, & the more I read the more it becomes real. I\u2019m thinking about going through with an abortion. \n\nI haven\u2019t particularly felt attached to this \u2018baby\u2019 since finding out.

No one else knows about this yet. Just me & my partner. I\u2019m terrified of actually scheduling my appointment and having to choose from pills or having to feel medical instruments inside me. I fear it\u2019ll cause me to go into depression and grieve horribly every time their EDD rolls around. \n\nIt\u2019s going to be okay. You know what\u2019s best for your situation.

I have been with my boyfriend for years, and we have a strong relationship, but i\u2019ve been helping him raise his child from a previous relationship since they were three years old, and now they are eight. We\u2019ve discussed not having kids because by the time we\u2019re in a position to, his child will already be 10+ and we\u2019d be starting over completely. Not to mention we are in no position financially, we\u2019d have to move into a bigger house which we cannot afford, especially because I am recently unemployed. \n\nThat being said, I really really do not want an abortion. It is scheduled for a couple weeks and I am so heartbroken and terrified. I know that it\u2019s the right choice for me and \u2018my baby\u2019 because if I were to keep it, it would not have a good life and I would honestly probably resent it. \n\nI can\u2019t have this baby, but I really hate that this is a decision I have to make. I have found myself praying for a miscarriage so that the choice isn\u2019t mine and I can mourn my baby without judgement.

I\u2019m crying while I type this and I just want to scream and rip my hair out.  \n\nI am so sad and scared I want my fucking mom but she thinks that it\u2019s murder and I really just feel so lost right now.\n\nIs it bad that I am grieving so hard for a loss that hasn\u2019t happened yet for someone I will never know, and when I\u2019m choosing to lose them? I wish so badly my situation was different so i wouldn\u2019t have to do this but it wouldn\u2019t be right for me to keep it. I feel like i\u2019ve been torn apart completely. \n\nI have an MA scheduled for 12/8 and i\u2019m hoping my clinic will just give me the pills and send me on my way so I can go through this at home and cry my eyes out as much as I need to. \n\nAdvice/virtual hugs appreciated; someone please tell me that i will be okay.",

A little backstory, we met about 5 months before I moved, and we started seeing each other. once I moved, we became serious because we recognized our feelings were strong. I am originally from Chicago, and my family is here. He is from Houston and is culturally different than me. Whenever I visit, I have noticed that he drinks excessively, and I think he is hiding a drinking problem from me. \n\nWith that being said, I have been on the fence on getting an abortion all these weeks. I have asked him if he will move to be with me and he says he can't because he is training for a new job but will be there as much as he can. I can't move because I just moved 6 months ago to Chicago for this great job and my mom has breast cancer right now. I do think he will be a great dad, but because we fight so much, plus he has a drinking problem I am not certain he will be a great partner. I have been awfully tough on him during this time by taking out my emotions on him and I do feel bad. \n\nThere is so much going on in my life right now. I feel isolated as is because I am back living in a new city, and I don't have many friends left here.  I am surrounded by my family, but I cannot talk to them due to their religious beliefs.

For my procedure they only numbed my cervix, so i had no after anesthesia effects to deal with. I had absolutely no cramping, or anything after, other than light bleeding. He took me for food and a milkshake. Honestly an incredible confort food meal after such a stressful time. \n\nFor your friend, maybe see if you can have a playlist of her favorite songs for the ride? Any podcasts she really likes? See if she has any requests for food/drink?\n\nNo matter what, it's gonna mean a lot that you're doing this for her, I promise.",

If they're doing medication abortion, they might take the first pill at the hospital, but they will be awake, alert, and totally normal seeming going home, as the abortion doesn't really start until they take additional pills. For a drive after a procedural abortion, a heading pad and a cozy blanket are both great ideas! A comfortable pillow might help, as well. Having some pain relievers (ibuprofen or Tylenol) on hand could also be handy.\n\nIf they have a procedural abortion and have general anesthesia, they might be hungry or thirsty afterward, too. Having some water, snacks, or money to pick something up on hand might be wise, as well!",

They're so wonderfully supportive.\n\nRegarding procedural abortions, \"surgical\" isn't a super accurate term because they don't involve and cutting or stitching. They're incredibly safe and effective. You can read more about first trimester procedures and medication abortion in [this article](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/considering-abortion/what-facts-about-abortion-do-i-need-know) from Planned Parenthood :)\n\nAlso, please do let me know if you're interested in learning about abortion funds!

[Plan C Pills](https://www.plancpills.org/) is also great for options to get pills by mail.\n\nIf you do think that going to a clinic would be the best experience for you, there are abortion funds that can help with costs.

But for those of us who feel this as a significant loss, the grieving IS the healing.  So please know that if you're hurting, it's part of your poor system trying to figure this out and make it work.\n\nHave you considered seeking emotional support for this IRL too?  It might help to find a therapist or call Exhale ProVoice, or to join a women's circle for healing.  You deserve to be held with love and tenderness as you process this loss and the weight of responsibility that you're feeling.  If I could grow myself big enough and soft enough to make it all fit, I know you can too.  I'm 10 years out and I feel very strong and loving about my choices now.  Feel what you feel.  The only thing I know about a feeling is that it will change and shift and move.  That's what feelings do.  Where you are today, you will not be forever.  Holding you very very gently and honoring this hard feeling right now.",

It\u2019s crazy because i use to complain about all the symptoms of pregnancy that i had and the day after my nausea went away and i felt confused. I also use to be hungry all the time and from someone recovering from an ed it kind of helped because if i didn\u2019t eat i felt horrible physically so i had to eat and now i\u2019m not hungry anymore.

I understand where he is coming from but I also feel I need support in this and not conflict, especially since I have had very bad nausea, pain and overall bed rest due to distress, I love him but I\u2019m not sure about anything right now, not to sound selfish but I feel he has made the situation more about him and his feelings rather than what is happening at large.

My doctor told me not to worry and that it might take time to start bleeding. A week later still nothing and I was experiencing pregnancy symptoms like growth of breasts and lower back pain.\n\nI then went to a gynaecologist specialist who did a scan and the placenta was still in there with the little ball sac. He explained that the first dose probably halted the pregnancy completely  but did not expel it.\n\nHe then prescribed the medication again  12 X 200 mg of misopristol and told me to repeat the procedure.\n\nLast night I inserted three pills into my vagina after disinfecting my hands thoroughly  as the procedure leave you prone to infection , and another two pills buccally( in the cheeks for 20 minutes before swallowing).\n\nI had strong cramping but no bleeding for about four hours even though I took pain killers ( paracetamol and codeine).  I then inserted another three pills into my vagina after 20 minutes as instructed . About an hour later I had very intense cramping, very intense chills almost like a fever even though I had taken strong pain killers .\n\nIt seems like all the symptoms were becoming more and more intense until I sat on the toilet expecting diarrhoea and a whole clot the size of a litchi or large strawberry   came out.\n\nI caught the clot on tissue paper and put it to the side I started vomiting intensely and also having diarrhoea at the same time for about 10 whole minutes . \n\nAfter that the cramping subsided and I immediately felt better.\n\nHowever, 10 minutes later the cramping started again and I had two or three more bouts of diarrhoea and fever with my stomach emptying completely.\n\nThe pain was very intense and coupled with nausea and fever it was almost unbearable. I was moaning and groaning in the bathroom it felt like what I would imagine giving birth feels like but worse.\n\nHowever ,after that intense moment all the pain all the nausea completely subsided the next morning I am bleeding a little bit here and there but no cramps and very little bleeding, only using a panty liner .\n\nThe placenta seems to have come out all in one piece so hopefully I won\u2019t bleed for a prolonged period of time.\n\nPlease note -I generally have quite heavy and painful periods (7 days)  and I have had  Diarrhoea and vomiting just from my period. It really freak me out when it happened during my abortion  because I was used to it and it has happened to me three or four times just because of my normal period . \n\nPerhaps if you have lighter periods with no pain you might not have the same experience I had.\n\nThe process of an abortion was much more complicated and harder than I anticipated however, I have no regrets . I will have a child when I\u2019m ready.",

        "body": "Hello everyone,\nI just wanted to share my experience with the abortion medication. I spent the entire week reading reddit threads and pregnancy and also miscarriage forums about people\u2019s experience with mifepristone and misoprostol. I think for the most part it helped\u2026 I learned a lot. But I also spent a lot of time in anxiety because of the horror stories I read. So I guess I wanted to share mine to hopefully help ease some worried minds. \n\nI found out I was pregnant on Wednesday afternoon around 3pm and felt like I dissociated- I went right to my phone to look up how to get an abortion. I am 30 years old and always knew I didn\u2019t want kids so there wasn\u2019t any hesitation to look up about abortion. One of the first things that came up was the abortion pills and that it could be sent to you via a virtual clinic. What an age we live in. I didn\u2019t really know anything about it. \n\nHeyJane is a virtual clinic where I had to answer some survey questions about my pregnancy, health, etc. and I could get the abortion medication. I opted to not use my insurance. It came out to be about $250. They said they would review my information within 24 hours and send the medication after.\n\nIt was actually a bit over 24 hours when I got a message saying that my abortion medication has been approved and prescribed. I had messaged them Thursday evening asking about the status of medication and they were closed. I had received the approval message Friday early morning. The medication shipped Friday afternoonish. \n\nFrom Wed-Friday nonstop I read countless threads on pregnancy symptoms, abortion stories, the abortion medication, miscarriages, everything pregnancy related. I figured out I was either 6 or 7 weeks pregnant (I don\u2019t keep track of my periods and they are usually very short, so I had to estimate) I felt relieved and anxious and sad(??) to get the medication. Maybe some part of me was actually becoming attached to this pregnancy. I felt like nausea was becoming a part of my identity. Anyway, the medication would be arriving on Saturday. \n\nI was out all day Saturday for some sports stuff and came back in the evening to take the medication around 8:30pm. I had reread and reread over and over about the process of taking mifepristone and misoprostol, but I read again as I took the mifepristone. Some places online said you can take the misoprostol pills vaginally right after, but the treatment plan I was sent said to wait 24-28hours to take the misoprostol. \n\nSunday I spent most of the day in bed and miserable, nauseous, emotional, anxious, and reading stories about taking misoprostol didn\u2019t help. I took two ibuprofen and one anti-nauseousness medicine at 8pm. As soon as it was 8:35pm I took the misoprostol vaginally. \nI laid in bed until 9:10pm to make sure it was absorbed in my body. At 9:10pm exactly I started to feel cramps as well. \nFrom 9:10-10:20pm I tried to clean to keep busy. \n10:20pm I went to the bathroom to try to poop. It was a similar crampy feeling like when you get the period poopies. There was a little bit of blood. And I also didn\u2019t poop. ): unsatisfied and crampy. \nI then took one ibuprofen PM and laid in bed with a diy heating pad and actually ktfo\u2019d by 11:15pm. \nI was still feeling cramps very much like period cramps. The heating pad helped a lot. \n\nAt 1:20am I woke up to pee, and I was slightly alarmed there was no blood on my pad. I was worried, but I was able to go back to sleep. \n\n9:30am I wake up and I can see some dried up blood on the bottom of my pad but it didn\u2019t seem like too much. I went to pee and could feel the clots coming out, but when I looked, it was too bright red to really make out if there was anything in there. \n\nThe rest of the day I feel decent and mild bleeding. Not much cramps. The nauseousness has gone away, and I am able to think about coffee without gagging, so I take just a few sips and feel relieved I don\u2019t feel nauseous at all.\n\nI was slightly worried though. I had read that people had suffered after taking misoprostol- diarrhea, vomit, fatigue, blood blood blood, terrible chills/fever. I didn\u2019t feel any of that. Maybe a little bit of chills in the beginning, but the ibuprofen PM knocked me out. \n\nI messaged the HeyJane virtual assistance thing my concerns and they responded within an hour. The lack of nausea is a good sign. They said they could also assist in booking me an ultrasound if I wanted peace of mind. I decided not to, so I guess I will wait and see in about 2-3 weeks when I take another pregnancy test. \n\nI wonder if reading my experience will give anybody peace of mind. Or if anyone is looking to get abortion medication, I personally had a good experience with HeyJane and would recommend.\n\nI guess this could be a good place to ask- about how much bleeding did you have if you took the abortion medication around 6-7weeks?\n\nEveryone also varies too. (according to the internet\u2026) Mine is medium\u2026 definitely less than I have on the first day of my period. \n\nI will still probably be reading a lot to see how will I know for certain the abortion worked. But overall, I still feel grateful for this experience. I never thought I would be pregnant ever, so I always wondered if I was fertile (very) and how pregnancy would feel (it sucks). I also learned a lot about abortion and pregnancy, and I think reading this much about it has given me a greater empathy towards the women who choose to get abortions, the women who have miscarriages, the women who choose to have children. Women in general. \n\nWell I guess that\u2019s that. I suppose I\u2019ll write an update for this when I take my pregnancy test. Thank you for reading. To write this all out actually helped me process everything, so hopefully this helps someone out there in some way\u2026\n\nUPDATE:\nI GOT MY FIRST PERIOD SINCE THE ABORTION MEDICATION. ITS CRAZY. SO MUCH CLOTS AND BLOOD AND CRAMPING. \nUsually my periods are tolerable or bad just for a day. I can workout and itll feel better. But no. I have been playing tennis all day and literally had to crouch over the whole time. Never got better so I had to come back home and I\u2019ve just been expelling clots and blood on the toilet like pee.",

        "body": "TW: Detailed MA experience\n\nI found out I was pregnant, officially at 4 weeks, but felt I was pregnant before then so it wasn\u2019t a total surprise. My cycle is very regular, I typically track ovulation to prevent pregnancy, and I\u2019m a birth worker. So it was basically just waiting for a test to show up positive. Unfortunately, I had a major pelvic injury this year from an accident and  I was warned that pregnancy could potentially kill or permanently harm me. And when those two lines turned blue I immediately had a sinking feeling and felt like a teenage as I explained to my doctor that, \u201cit was just one time,\u201d as comfortable penetrative sex was one of my doctor and I\u2019s long term PT goals. \n\nSo I see doctors. So many doctors. Neonatal specialists, pelvic surgeons, OBGYNs, pelvic floor PTs, regular PTs, therapists, acupuncturists, and maternal fetal medicine specialists. And if you don\u2019t know, until you reach 12 weeks or so, every ultrasound will be internal. And as a Black woman, it\u2019s rare to have this many medical professionals unanimously tell me that I should not continue with the pregnancy due to being so young, with such high risks. I won\u2019t get into all of them, but death (of me and the potential fetus) was mentioned many times. A scary amount of times. And while it should\u2019ve been an easy decision, it very much pained me to ignore the overwhelming maternal urge to protect it. \n\nMy OBGYN attempted to persuade me to wait and see, either waiting to miscarriage or having a late term abortion. And I just couldn\u2019t stomach the thought of feeling movement or handling the already increasing pain from my injuries. So I reached out to a nonprofit in my state that provides affordable MA assistance and got the medication within 3 business days. The Nurse RN was very empathetic and supportive, and provided detailed instructions and a 24/7 contact line. My husband took off work to help me through the process, and thank God he did, because I was not adequately prepared for what I was about to endure. \n\n\u201cLight cramping like a mild period, some nausea, and expect it to start 24 - 48 hours after the second dose of pills.\u201d The first pill was fine - emotional but fine. 24 hours later, I chose to go the suppository route, afraid I might throw it up. Took Tylenol, ibuprofen , an edible, and an anti nausea that was prescribed to prepare for any pain. No less than 30 minutes after the suppositories, the cramping begun. And it hit me like a freight train. It was like a frightening out of body experience. A weird role reversal where suddenly I was the client and my husband was my inexperienced Doula. \n\nI tried different positions, an exercise ball, a CUB, a heating pad on max\u2026 nothing helped. It was like I never took the pain killers. My husband popped a diaper on me, transitioned me from the bed room to the toilet, where I began to violently throw up and bleed. From there I was in the shower, the only comfort coming from the hot water my husband was spraying on my pelvic region. And once in there, it was rinse and repeat. Contraction, attempting to push like the RN advised, failing because my pelvic floor is damaged, and throwing up until I passed a clot or lining. This went on for hours. \n\nI couldn\u2019t have done it alone, my husband was a god send. It was like I wasn\u2019t really there and everything felt so hazy and painful. My husband monitored how often and how big the clots were, which was a plus being in the bathtub. And he was also able to make sure the embryonic sac passed, which was deeply traumatizing for both of us. It was like a hot pokers in my abdomen and vagina. \n\nBut then, after a few hours, it was finally better. I continued to bleed for a month, had further complications due to my injuries, but received good care and the nexplanon implant. I\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around the emotional side of things, but physically I\u2019m getting better. And I write this not to scare anyone, but to be clear that this MA potentially saved my life. It was hard, physically challenging, but not impossible. And if you\u2019re scared or alone, you can do it. Do not be afraid to ask for help from someone you trust and know that your life matters - there is no shame in saving, respecting, or preserving it.",

Im 21 years old, 7 weeks and few days pregnant according to the calculations on Flo and a few other sites I\u2019ve looked up. I have an appointment on January 7th for my medical abortion and I will be about 10 weeks by then. It\u2019s on a Saturday but from what I\u2019ve read I\u2019ll take the first pill there and then take the second pill 24 hours later(on Sunday). Will I need to take Monday off of work? I want to be as comfortable as possible going through this process. Has anyone had a medical abortion with the pills at 10 weeks? Im worried the abortion might not work, what will I do then? How soon will I know that it\u2019s not working? Hopefully soon enough to have another procedure done. I have no idea how I\u2019ll afford it on top of all of my other bills either, does anyone know of any funding options? I\u2019m in SC but having my abortion in NC. My mama is pushing me not to have the abortion and to keep the baby and it\u2019s making me feel awful. Im so scared to go through this and lose her respect, love, support. Im just really nervous and have so many questions. Thank you in advance for anyone responding.",

                                "body": "Agreed. \n\nOP, if I\u2019m understanding you correctly this is the order of events. \n\n1) abortion #1 on 9/16\n2) 4 weeks after abortion, negative pregnancy test result\n3) birth control started \n4) unprotected sex 10/27\n5) positive test \n\nI realize you had a negative test after abortion before unprotected sex took place. However, you could have received a false negative (aka a negative result) so a test that did not detect remaining hcg levels (which is what causes a positive test). Some tests are capable of detecting much lower levels of hcg than others. Perhaps this test was not picking up your low levels, despite there still being *some* Hcg left in your body post abortion (this is normal by the way, and the exact time it takes to have an hcg of 0 varies between women). Also, there could have been user error. Tests need to be used correctly to guarantee an accurate result. Especially when hcg levels are low, it\u2019s important this are done correct per the directions. For instance, some tests want you to pee on a stick for no more than 5 seconds and lay flat, some may require 15 seconds, etc. If any of these variable were off, it could cause a false negative. \n\nTypically, implantation (the official beginning of pregnancy when you begin producing hcg) doesn\u2019t occur until 2-3 weeks after sex. It is very unlikely you are detecting hcg from a new pregnancy 6 days after sex. \n\nI think it\u2019s much more likely you still have remaining hcg from your prior pregnancy lingering, which was caught on your most recent test. It\u2019s possible this time you used a more sensitive test, tested in the morning when your hcg level was most detectable in your urine, or had less user error than previously, which would explain this test being positive despite a prior negative. \n\nDoes this make sense?\n\nI\u2019m not a medical doctor though, and this is not professional medical advice. So I definitely recommend following up in clinic for a repeat test, perhaps a blood test and/or ultrasound. \n\nHope this helps! \u2665\ufe0f",

This was my worst fear and I thought he didn\u2019t care but then I directly asked him how he really felt and he said that he was really stressed and hated himself for putting me through that. In my case, my partner coped by becoming quiet and direct. Maybe your bf\u2019s blunt response is his way of coping and being supportive. A stress response. However, you really do need to speak to him about how you are feeling and I\u2019m so sorry if he really doesn\u2019t care because you deserve so much better. My partner ended up being really supportive with everything and kept reassuring me everything would be okay.

I am absolutely devastated as I am on birth control, a college student struggling in every aspect who is just absolutely not ready to bring a child into this world. The guilt and overwhelming emotions have been really hurting me and I\u2019ve been dealing with it quite badly it\u2019s all I think about, I haven\u2019t been eating and I\u2019ve been uncontrollably crying. I know it\u2019s the right thing for me I just didn\u2019t expect to be this upset about it.\nMy boyfriend though, has a weird reaction to it. I\u2019ve seen peoples boyfriends not want them to get one or are forcing them however my boyfriend simply doesn\u2019t care. I\u2019m glad he is so accepting and open about it but it\u2019s almost too nonchalant and it is driving me insane. He just keeps saying it\u2019s not a big deal and to get over it and it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle. I ask him to respect me and how I feel because it is a big deal to me and he just says stop being dramatic. When I had just done the pregnancy test and I was sitting on the toilet I rang him immediately to tell him I\u2019m pregnant and I was crying and he was like yeah yeah just ring the abortion clinic tomorrow forget about it for now you\u2019re fine.  I was sitting in silence as I was freaking out and he hung up and said well you are ignoring me so why would I stay on the phone. He just has no remorse or sympathy or understanding for what I\u2019m about to go through and I don\u2019t know what to do? I said you need to understand the physical pain I\u2019m going to have to go through and the emotional pain too and he just says you\u2019re fine stop being so dramatic. Any advice? I can\u2019t force him to understand I just don\u2019t know what to do I almost wish I didn\u2019t tell him now.",

              "body": "First of all: you are NOT alone.\n\nI've spent many years performing abortions for people at your gestational age or later.  They all have something in common with you: they're pregnant, and *under their current circumstances*, they're deciding that their best option is to have an abortion.\n\nMany of them make that decision because they discover that the man in their life was not who they hoped he was.  You are so very much not alone.  And if you were ever sitting in a clinic waiting room with any of the other women in situations like yours, you wouldn't call them \"the lowest piece of shit on the planet.\"  Please treat yourself as kindly as you'd treat them.\n\n---\n\nWhen people talk about later abortion, a lot of people make a big deal about the difference between later abortions in the setting of, say, a bad fetal diagnosis, vs. a later abortion with its root in more social circumstances.  I think that the line doesn't exist.  I have met too many people in situations like yours, who have tender feelings, and are going through a lot of loss, and just wish their circumstances were different -- that's all the same as for people facing a fetal diagnosis.\n\n> I\u2019m really worried how this will affect my mental health when it\u2019s all over. This is already messing with my head so bad and I\u2019m scared it will break me.\n\nGoing through loss without support is traumatizing, especially when it's stigmatized and you can't talk about it.  [Exhale Pro-Voice](https://exhaleprovoice.org/) is a good free support option.  When people are having abortions later in pregnancy, I often direct them to [Who Not When](https://whonotwhen.com/) -- it's not designed as a patient resource, but it's *very* destigmatizing, and that might be helpful for you right now.\n\nMost of all, though, I want to come back to how you're not alone.  I've met so many people who needed their abortions because of bad men, but who wished they could be in a different situation.  What helps them is remembering the difference between regretting the *situation* and regretting their *decision.*\n\nAlso therapy.\n\nAlso... where I've worked, I've been able to offer people viewings, handprints/footprints, ultrasound pictures... think about if you want anything like that.\n\n---\n\nI want to emphasize to you that you should NOT choose to have an abortion because he's asking you to.  I don't think that's what's going on.  I think you're realizing that he won't be there for you, and deciding that the costs of having a child and being tied to him are not bearable for you.\n\nBut if I'm wrong about that, let me know.  If you want help figuring out resources for continuing the pregnancy, let me know.\n\n(Also, feel free to message me where you're going for your care.  Do you need any practical support?  Help getting funding for travel or for your procedure?)\n\n<3\n\nBe kind to yourself.",

We can be your support system <3\n\nA hotline called [All-Options](https://www.all-options.org/find-support/talkline/), which provides emotional support as well as help making decisions related to pregnancy, is still taking calls right now. If what you want to do is vent about the situation and process all of these emotions, I \\*highly\\* suggest reaching out to them.\n\nAside from that hotline, I just want to say that you are not a piece of shit. You are a human who is navigating a challenging situation. Many people, unfortunately, feel pressure from outsiders on their decisions \u2014\u00a0and many people change their minds a few times. I know you feel alone right now, but you're not alone in feeling this way.\n\nWhat you feel is right is right. Please take care of yourself and let me know if there's anything else we can do to help.",

He has since been charged and I also have a restraining order on him.\n\nI\u2019ve tried all I can to save my family there\u2019s nothing else I can possibly do. Today after being caught in several more lies even when faced with the truth. He\u2019s made it crystal clear that he now wants me to have an abortion and if I choose to keep the baby he won\u2019t be in her life physically or support us at all financially. Even though just 2 days ago he told me he\u2019d always be there for the baby and I no matter what.\n\nWorst part is that before all this happened, he\u2019s the one who BEGGED me to keep this baby.\n\nI\u2019m scheduled to have an abortion next week but it\u2019s the hardest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make. I\u2019m able to feel her kicking and moving around inside of me and I feel so guilty for what I\u2019m about to do.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a 3-day procedure which just makes everything more difficult and devastating.\n\nI\u2019ve literally been crying all day and night and I have zero support system so I\u2019m just stuck here being eaten alive by my thoughts and having to go through this traumatic experience while he\u2019s out being happy living his best life being single without a care in the world! \n\nI\u2019m 23 weeks now & have bonded with her, I know her schedule by when she kicks and moves, I\u2019ve got all my ultrasound pictures on my fridge. He abandoned us after begging me to keep this baby. This feels so surreal.\n\nI\u2019m really worried how this will affect my mental health when it\u2019s all over. This is already messing with my head so bad and I\u2019m scared it will break me.\n\nI have no family, no support system and no one I can call and vent to about the situation.\n\nFeeling like the lowest piece of shit on the planet.\n\nI plan on spending the 2nd and 3rd day at a crisis centre after my procedure because I just know I might take my own life. I\u2019m so devastated that I have to give up my baby but I know it\u2019s for the best, given the circumstances.\n\nI know I need to cut all ties and communication with this man and that\u2019s part of what drives my decision. I don\u2019t want to be tied to him for the next 18 years, I\u2019m just setting both myself & our child up for more pain and misery & he\u2019s put us through ENOUGH!\n\nI just feel so alone in this.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI hate that I had to do this but I genuinely felt like I had no other choice. Both of my options were absolutely horrible! It\u2019s so messed up because as much as he claimed to love us he hasn\u2019t even tried to reach out. He doesn\u2019t even know she\u2019s gone \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\udc94\n\nI\u2019m really struggling mentally and emotionally right now \ud83d\ude22",

I took the Mifepristone on 11/03 and placed the 4 tablets between my cheeks and gums approximately 12 hours later. On 11/04, I had very bad cramping and also experienced some diarrhea. I did bleed and noticed a blood clot in the toilet but I only bleed for like half a day, after that, there was no more bleeding.  On 11/21, I went to see my doctor because I am still feely extremely nauseous, tired, and have very sore boobs. I was provided a pregnancy test and tested positive. They informed me that I was approximately 7 weeks pregnant at the time, which means I would've been approximately 5 weeks pregnant when I took the pills. I am extremely confused at this point and not sure if I am really still pregnant. I do have an appointment with my OBGYN on 12/09 but I am extremely inpatient and would just like to know if I had a successful abortion. Abortionrx does have an online customer person who can help in which they informed me that it's possible to test positive due to the tissue that can be left. They also informed me that abortion kits are about 97% successful. Has anybody else had an experience similar to mine? I would appreciate the feedback!!",

I definitely suggest it if you\u2019re able to get it. \n\nFirst they asked general medical questions, gave me an antibiotic and 2 ibuprofen 400, then took me back to for an ultrasound. I opted to not see the US or hear the heartbeat. I was having a hard time already and that would probably make it worse. They hooked up the IV and within seconds I was out. I woke up in the recovery room with no pain. Was bleeding but felt no nausea just drowsy. I stayed home for a couple days to calm my nerves. I had a few days of bad cramping when passing large clots. At one week later, I\u2019m barely bleeding. The physical process is easy and so is the mental process if you know for sure you want to terminate. I have been mentally unstable since I got pregnant and am having a rougher time but I think it\u2019s because of my personal issues. Overall, I suggest SA over MA.",

My doctor told me not to worry and that it might take time to start bleeding. A week later still nothing and I was experiencing pregnancy symptoms like growth of breasts and lower back pain.\n\nI then went to a gynaecologist specialist who did a scan and the placenta was still in there with the little ball sac. He explained that the first dose probably halted the pregnancy completely but did not expel it.\n\nHe then prescribed the medication again 12 X 200 mg of misopristol and told me to repeat the procedure.\n\nLast night I inserted three pills into my vagina after disinfecting my hands thoroughly as the procedure leave you prone to infection , and another two pills buccally( in the cheeks for 20 minutes before swallowing).\n\nI had strong cramping but no bleeding for about four hours even though I took pain killers ( paracetamol and codeine). I then inserted another three pills into my vagina after 20 minutes as instructed . About an hour later I had very intense cramping, very intense chills almost like a fever even though I had taken strong pain killers .\n\nIt seems like all the symptoms were becoming more and more intense until I sat on the toilet expecting diarrhoea and a whole clot the size of a litchi or large strawberry came out.\n\nI caught the clot on tissue paper and put it to the side I started vomiting intensely and also having diarrhoea at the same time for about 10 whole minutes .\n\nAfter that the cramping subsided and I immediately felt better.\n\nHowever, 10 minutes later the cramping started again and I had two or three more bouts of diarrhoea and fever with my stomach emptying completely.\n\nThe pain was very intense and coupled with nausea and fever it was almost unbearable. I was moaning and groaning in the bathroom it felt like what I would imagine giving birth feels like but worse.\n\nHowever ,after that intense moment all the pain all the nausea completely subsided the next morning I am bleeding a little bit here and there but no cramps and very little bleeding, only using a panty liner .\n\nThe placenta seems to have come out all in one piece so hopefully I won\u2019t bleed for a prolonged period of time.\n\nPlease note -I generally have quite heavy and painful periods (7 days) and I have had Diarrhoea and vomiting just from my period. It really freak me out when it happened during my abortion because I was used to it and it has happened to me three or four times just because of my normal period .\n\nPerhaps if you have lighter periods with no pain you might not have the same experience I had.\n\nThe process of an abortion was much more complicated and harder than I anticipated however, I have no regrets . I will have a child when I\u2019m ready.",

        "body": "Hey everyone.\n\nFirstly, I want to thank everyone who commented on my other post. I ended up getting help through AidAccess and made the payment securely to get abortion pills shipped to me. The pills are arriving today, and I am beyond happy to finally have my abortion. I broke up with my ex on Tuesday after accepting the fact that he:\n\n1) ***is an alcoholic and addict that is not interested in recovery.*** He's had two DUIs before I met him, and he still drives drunk to this day. I fell in love with him before I knew about that. When I found out, I decided I'd help him, which led me to accepting near constant abuse from him. I told him about being pregnant last Wednesday. Three days later, he harvested several pounds of mushrooms he'd been growing. He's planning to be drunk and high all fall/winter. In the meantime, he didn't do a damn thing to help through pregnancy.  So he made time to get drunk, high, and play golf, but he didn't do shit to help his pregnant, sick girlfriend. He was also trying to guilt me into keeping the baby, but he admitted- 'in jest'- that he'd be out drunk/high golfing while his mother and I took care of the baby. He seemed very angry and disappointed that I'm getting an abortion, but I don't give a damn about his manipulations.\n\n2) ***is abusive.*** He would say/do awful things while drunk, lie about being sorry just to get me to come back, and say/do the awful things all over again. He refused to go to free counseling and free AA/Al-Anon to save our relationship. In truth, this is who he is. This is his character, and there's no 'good side' to him.\n\n3) ***does not deserve a child from me***. He is lazy and unsupportive. He'd be a terrible father, just as he is a terrible partner. I can't imagine risking my life to birth a child to an ungrateful jackass.\n\nThat's it. This experience has made me so much stronger, more confident, and more loving to myself. This is my most important boundary and the biggest power and gift I have as a woman- controlling who, and what, exists on this Earth through my womb. I will not EVER have a child by an addict, abuser, or jackass. I won't do it. I don't care if that means I never have children since it seems like a lot of us here have encountered this type of man. Through Al-Anon, I've learned what I can and can't control. MY BODY and MY WOMB I have 100% control over, and I will NEVER allow a child of mine to be born to a man like my ex. I feel like I am already an excellent mother by being picky and precise in what I allow to continue through me. I will not allow another person to abandon and abuse an innocent being. \n\nSo thank you again everyone here! This has been such a transformative experience for me. I have learned to stand up for myself and my future more than ever through this. I am loved and supported by people around me. I told EVERYONE around me about my ex and my pregnancy/abortion. **They all support me!** You are not alone, no matter how hard it seems. Please tell your story. Do not go it alone. \n\nHave a lovely day. Be blessed and happy. Love to you all.",

Please please please make sure they have enough numbing medications for you because it felt like someone was scraping out my insides and I was being held down I was ready to fight the nurses and doctors but the relief I felt after that was amazing I bled for a day and that\u2019s it but I feel way better I hope y\u2019all experience is better than mines",

        "body": "To anyone who is about to get an abortion or considering, I just had a surgical abortion yesterday and wanted to share my experience because I was extremely nervous beforehand and reading through everyone\u2019s posts here really helped me feel less terrified. So I hope I can do the same for others. \n\nI opted for the procedure instead of pills because I had to go out of state to get this done and I wanted it to be confirmed successful in office before going home. (Shoutout to r/childfree and r/auntienetwork for helping make the travel possible for me). Plus, the procedure (in my opinion) was quicker and less painful than the pills are usually described. \n\nSo the appointment itself took about 4 hours, but the procedure only lasted a total of 5 minutes. Most of the time was spent on prep and discharge paperwork. I was lucky enough to be in a clinic full of women and have a female doctor and they were all so helpful and sweet and I wouldn\u2019t have gotten through the process without them. I was TERRIFIED of the pain from the procedure, but once it was actually happening I realized that the fear that was built up in my head was WAY worse than the actual procedure. It for sure didn\u2019t feel good, but I was not screaming in pain or anything. It was a breeze compared to what I thought it was going to be like. \n\nFirst she did a finger check inside me, that was uncomfortable but quick. Then the speculum, again uncomfortable but nothing too bad. Then came the numbing shots. There were a total of 3 placed in my cervix and the first one felt like a small pinch/burn, I didn\u2019t feel the second one, and for some reason the third one was a pretty sharp pain but it only lasted for literally one second and then I was numbed. Over the course of the next 2-3 minutes the doctor used tiny metal rods to dilate the cervix and then place the small suction tube into my uterus. I could feel pressure from it dragging around in there but it went very fast. The most intense part was when she was suctioning the last little bit but it only lasted a few seconds max and at worst it felt like uncomfortable pressure and slight cramping. It was seriously over before I knew it and the nurse held my hand the entire time. They timed it and from the insertion of the speculum to the removal of the suction tool it only took a total of 4mins 7secs. After the suction was removed the pain immediately started to decline fast. Within one minute my pain level was at a 1/10. I\u2019d say the pain only got up to a 5/10 max durning the whole thing. And again, it did not last long whatsoever. Afterwards they let me lay in the room for about 20 minutes to get my bearings while they went over aftercare instructions. I was not rushed out or anything, I was just seriously feeling good enough to leave that fast. I was even able to drive right after. After the numbing stuff wore off two hours later, I felt slight cramping but took some ibuprofen and it worked like a charm. Now I\u2019m just bleeding a little bit here and there (which is normal). Totally safe, simple, and quick procedure.\n\nI can\u2019t speak for everyone obviously, this was just my personal experience. I want to thank this community for being here because without it I would\u2019ve been  even more of a nervous wreck than I already was. I just hope that maybe this post helps to put some others minds at peace if anyone else has an abortion coming up soon. It can be a scary thing to go through, but it was absolutely worth it and I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world. It was definitely the right choice for me. Good luck to all my ladies and people with vaginas out there, you can absolutely do this if you want to \ud83d\udc9c",

Part of the responsibility of being a sexually active adult is to have a plan in place if your contraception fails. Do some research into abortion in your area: is it legal, up to what point, do you need parental consent if you\u2019re under 18, are there any hospitals or clinics who do abortions nearby and how much do they cost. There are abortion funds that are intended to help people in poverty/low income get abortions so they don\u2019t have to have children they can\u2019t afford/don\u2019t want.",

He was heavily against the abortion and refused to talk to me while I was going through it. \n\nLast night was the first time we saw eachother for the first time in weeks. We were supposed to spend the day together today. Before we met up he mentioned something about us having sex and I told him no because I\u2019m still bleeding and I\u2019m not ready to have sex yet. \n\nThis morning he kept trying to initiate sex. I kept saying no, through out the entire day he kept trying to change my mind. After awhile he started getting mad and mumbling things under his breath. Eventually we got into it because I was being distant and he noticed but I didn\u2019t wanna tell him what was wrong. I guess I didn\u2019t wanna say anything about the fact he was making me uncomfortable because I knew it wasn\u2019t his intentions. I don\u2019t know. \n\nEventually he just goes \u201cyou ready to go home?\u201d And takes me home early. Once I got home I texted him coming clean about how I felt about everything. He called me and told me none of this happened and we need to stop seeing each other. \n\nNow I just feel so indifferent. Like I feel wrong for feeling trauma towards having sex now. I\u2019m afraid of getting pregnant again, I\u2019m not on birth control again yet. Sex itself is how I ended up in this position so there\u2019s so much trauma there. My abortion wasn\u2019t easy for me mentally. I just need more time. Not to mention I am still bleeding and cramping. Like why does he get to make me feel wrong for not wanting to have sex and then telling me none of this ever happened today?? Idk",

I just wanted to share an update.\n\nFirst, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU to this subreddit for helping me when I was going through an emergency and didn't know how to get help right away.\n\nI used Aid Access to get the medical abortion pills. I was prescribed the typical mifepristone/misoprostol combo. I took the miso about 8 hours after taking mifepristone. I started bleeding and cramping about 4 hours after that. I typically lose a lot of blood during my normal periods (100 mL a day). So I wasn't surprised that I lost that plus more. Yeah I had cramps. I lost mega blood. I wore period underwear and made braised ribs, ordered sushi, ate tacos, slept, and watched TV during those days while also working my full-time job. I work from home. So I even went through work and lived my life normally through all of this. I also went to a concert about 5 days after taking miso. I started doing sports and working out again about 3 days after. I got my period back 34 days later.\n\nSpiritually, I knew when the life inside me left. I have a lot of feelings about it, but I ultimately feel good knowing that the baby is back to God and not experiencing any pain caused by an alcoholic father. Had he chosen to quit the day I told him and chosen to be a family, things would have been different. In that moment, the baby wasn't safe with him as father, and so I made the right choice. I feel like I should have never been having pre-marital sex in the first place according to my personal beliefs.\n\nThe father of the child and I still love each other. He wants to be a family some day, but he knows he has to quit drinking for good for that to ever work out. Plus, I don't believe in having babies outside of marriage and commitment before God, family, and community. So that's where I'm at now- happy and grateful, looking forward to having a family some day. I got my period back and live to ovulate another day.\n\nHappy Friday, ladies :)",

That isn't yours, it's his.  I'm so sorry that he seems to be so immature that he takes his feelings out on you.  It is a good idea to take some space from him when he's like that, because it isn't fair or healthy for you to take on the brunt of his feelings. \n\nYou have your own feelings to contend with.  You had this pregnancy, then you had the surprise about the dates, and then you had the loss.  You have the experience of passing that loss and whatever feelings come with it.  And now you have grief, something to release, and disappointment because your man isn't who you thought he'd be.  You have the future disappointment of \"my kids might not all have the same father\" and that's a lot to integrate, too.  You're 16.  It's so young.

Because even for myself i was a wreck during it- i was in so much pain and crying that i needed someone to be with me so it makes me so mad that he couldn\u2019t cancel one dinner or ask to move it to the next day when it would be a bit less painful. You absolutely deserve better he should\u2019ve been with you- especially since you explained that he knew when it was happening but planned this dinner anyways- i can understand if he was scared or something in away but not being there for you just really shows his colours in my opinion. \n\nIt amazing that you had someone to be with you even if it was just your friend, because that is something so hard to go through on your own. Im sending you my love & if you need to chat about it feel free to message me \u2764\ufe0f",

I took the pregnancy blocking hormone on Friday, so he knew my abortion would start properly on Saturday but he said he was taking his family to dinner and has to drive them so he came to chill with me for abit after work, after 4 hours of one of the worst pains I've ever felt in my life. My girl stayed over to keep me company instead. Today I took my last two pills and my boyfriend texted me and called to see how I was getting on. He said he was getting ready and I asked where he was going and he says he's going to eat with his family. I asked him where his priorities are at, going for a meal with his family or being with me when I'm going through an abortion and he just said it's sticky.\n\nHe apologised for not being there for me fully and I said to him if he can't be there for me during an abortion he'll never be there for me and he said he doesn't want to let me go and how he's the man of the house and is family rely on him for everything and that I make it sound like he doesn't wanna stay over with me when he does.\n\nI told him I'm not going to speak to him anymore after Monday. It would've made a huge difference to me if he'd stayed round mine or made the effort to come to mine for longer than an hour to be with me during the weekend he knew I would be going through this. He answered all of my calls while I was going through it and showed up before and after work on Saturday but I personally don't think that's enough. Any similar experiences? What do you guys think?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the messages and the support, it meant alot to me and I read every single comment!! I'm so glad some of us were treated the way we should have been and my heart goes out to all of us girls who got less than but got through it anyway <3.

I would have been 8 weeks and 6 days today, the size was maybe close to a \u00a310 note, thick , heavy . After that or even now as I'm writing this I'm still getting contraction type pains but it was no where near as bad as I had imagined.\nI'm only describing this all in such detail in hope it gives someone who's going through it now, some confidence that it will be ok , don't worry about the pain or anything like that, it's true when they say we create the worst versions in our head until it actually happens and you realise it definitely isn't as bad as you think.\nI feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I'm using this experience to make 100% more effort on my three young girls and be my best version this year, and In memory of the baby I'm going to get a birth stone so I dont ever forget her.\nI hope this helps someone , god knows I needed this when I was experiencing it .\nAnyone who reads this and wants to\n talk please don't hesitate to message me x",
