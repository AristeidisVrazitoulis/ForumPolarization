SSA is a giant program, apparently far from the people and it works. Why don't we focus on good government rather than some generalized concept of big versus small or close versus far?\n\nRight now, current SSA benefit levels plus inflation could be maintained forever on a funding increase of less than one percent of GDP.\n\n>Big governments are the ones who helped create these massive multi-billion dollar multi-national corporations.\n\nAs I recall, there were some huge corporations and three oligarchs in the 1800's who literally owned more than two percent of the entire economy.

Trump being president has made the mainstream media, and nearly the entire DC establishment, suddenly be on the side of the people? They are now telling you the truth about conspiracies? We should now listen to and believe them?\n\nThe President ran on a platform of weeding out corruption in DC. \"Draining the swamp\", if you will. He wins, and the establishment absolutely loses their MINDS. Immediately launches into full fledged attack mode, and hasn't let off the gas since... and you think THOSE are the people we should trust? The ones that he was talking about during his campaign, which is why so many people voted for him in the first place??\n\nMeanwhile, those very same people tell you that anyone who supports the President is essentially Russian propaganda. He's Putin's puppet and must be stopped. \n\nI'm sorry, but anyone who's actually been paying attention, and has been a conspiracy theorist for much longer than this past election, can see right through TPTB's attempts to stop what seems to be coming. The harder they fight, the more I actually start to believe in Trump. And that's really saying something, considering I hate both sides (despite what some trolls may try to claim about me). \n\nThe fact of the matter is, at NO POINT in my 7+ years here, have this sub and r/news or r/politics EVER been in line with each other.

Hopefully that will stop these T_D trolls from brigading this thread!!! We should all be so grateful that the Reddit admins allow them to continually break site wide rules in order to manipulate this sub, despite the mods\u2019 constant requests for them to do something about it. Way to stand up to those evil pro-Trump moderators, Reddit!\n\nEdit 2: Great job everybody! It looks like we\u2019ve successfully bested the Trump trolls, since every single post that supports our new r/Conspiracy rules are all in double digit positives, and all the evil \u201cTrump sympathizers\u201d and people that talk badly about the media are deep in the negatives. Congratulations guys, we did it! All hail the truth-tellers aka the MSM! ",

A prop is clearly used at 37:13 to recreate the earths terminator line dividing night and day. The footage was unedited at that point so obviously the size of clouds and water you mentioned have been specifically chosen unless of course you think the earth is covered in a tiny amount of gigantic clouds. Since you're a photographer I encourage you to watch the documentary \"American Moon\" where professional photographers analyze NASA's official photos of the landings and arrive at the conclusion they have been faked.",

But we can clearly see that this is not a close up section of the planet (size of clouds, lots of water and complete land masses, speed of rotation) and every time the camera moves it would change the edges of the earth in view.\n\nWhen you want to make something appear farther away you use a wide angle lens not a zooming telephoto lens.",

You would have to put the camera as close as possible to the window and use a very wide angle lense.\n\nThe zooms in the footage shows they are using a telephoto lens.\n\nYou can easily verify all this at home with your own phone camera.",

USSR in particular closely monitored it the whole time. If it was fake, they would have had to have been in on the alternate transmissions because they would have needed to track and report those. If USSR had proof there was no mission, they would have LOUDLY announced this. They would have published their proof. It's been 50+ years, and they still are in on the coverup? No one has come forward?\n\nChina also had a space program in 1969 and would have had the same motivations to be extremely public with their proof that we faked it. Again, they would need to have been given the information to the fake transmissions to play along with their own scientists \"tracking\" the mission.\n\nYes. 1000s of Americans would have to be in on the coverup. Who exactly would depend on whether you think the entire launch was faked or just specifically the moon walk portion. All the astronauts, mission control, everyone who ran the fake moon landing set plus all the crafts people and engineers who had to build the fake machines and fake moon suits, the broadcasters and camera people, everyone running every single powerful telescope at the time, artists to fake the still photography needed, plus most of the designers and engineers who must have been told to stop designing things for space and to instead design them to work on a sound stage, the mathematicians who would have to give earth-based math for things. Believe it or not, faking the moon walk would actually be an extremely detailed -- something I think people overlook. The technology required to do it would have been extraordinarily top secret or something. So all the people who worked on the \"top secret ways to fake gravity's effect on fake regolith live on camera\" program would have to be kept silent afterwards as well. And all that is just the people back in 1969 -- we need to continue to bring more people into the conspiracy because as the decades go on there's -- for instance -- the pictures China is taking of the moon RIGHT NOW that shows the landing sites. So there's a couple more dozen people who need to kept silent.\n\nI imagine NASA kept the broadcast signals as locked down as they could because they would want to be in control of cutting broadcast if there was an accident. The mission had a high chance of injury/death.",

I thought you were going to say that Phil became a moon landing denialist.  Phil is an amazing astronomer as well as a science educator/pseudo science/science skeptic. The dudes all about evidence and what that evidence most likely represents. Pseudo science/ bad science has been a grift for 100\u2019s of years. People trying to make money from it or trying to make a name for themselves. Cold Fusion, FTL particles, miracle cures( which is something that hits home to me. I have an extremely rare disease in which there is a forum for. The only section I check are the latest studies section. I had to stop going to the regular convo forums because people were so desperate to try to find any sort of help/relief they were trying stuff that was dangerous or just outright crazy with absolutely no basis in basic science. I feel really bad for these people that there are people out there who are willing to take money from some of the most desperate and helpless people out there) and the list goes on and on from that douche bag Wakefield publishing admittedly false data in his paper tying vaxxes to autism (look at what that\u2019s done) to that crazy bitch who started that fake blood test company to lobotomies and on and on it goes. \n\nJust be careful where you get your info from man.  If I need a new roof I\u2019m not calling the plumber ya know. Listen to the experts.

Maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding what you\u2019re saying. \n\nBut without a doubt NASA is the most successful/non political organization within the federal government. I mean just the JW telescope is an awesome (classical use) example of what NASA is capable of. \n\nIf this was about the IRS or FBI or something I think I would definitely be leaning towards your skeptical approach. But NASA? IDK man. It\u2019s probably the most successful organization wrg to technology/etc in the world. The Martian landings alone were incredible human feats of engineering. Outside of a few (and major: shuttle disasters) they\u2019ve been batting pretty close to 1000. \n\nBut I just wanted to point out that I thought your last sentence was great. The more evidence/data points you have the higher the probability that something is either true ir false. It\u2019s not often I see people say more evidence. I think a lot of people get caught in a self confirmation bias loop they can\u2019t escape from because they shutoff all evidence that doesn\u2019t fit their biases. You saying more evidence is a nice change of pace to see and also shows you\u2019re willing to change your view based on more/newer evidence.

They conceded that the US  reached the moon before they did. At the time they were also planning a moon shot because of the space race. \n\n3. Bonus:  in order for telemetry/media data to get back to earth, NASA used a bunch of radar/relay stations around the world. So you had EME bouncing from Australia to Europe to the US etc. \n\nFor a conspiracy this big there\u2019s just too many people involved to keep it secret. \n\nAnd that\u2019s just touching the surface. There\u2019s a ton of evidence wrg to the moon landings. \n\nPro tip. Don\u2019t say that to Buzz. He\u2019ll hit ya with a nice cross in the chin(check it out in YouTube. Someone tells him that the moon landings were fake and Buzz blasted the dude in the face). \n\nIMO there\u2019s a certain threshold of the number of people involved in a conspiracy and when the bigger the number the harder to keep secret. In the moon landings you literally had 10,000s of people working on the Apollo missions.  \n\nAnd if you have or ever come across a really nice telescope (there\u2019s ametuere(sorry my spelling sucks) you can see the shit we left up there. It\u2019s pretty cool). \n\nAnyway that\u2019s all I got. Have a great week dude",

The dust is ionized, so it sticks to things.\n\nThe total mission length was slightly more than eight days. That\u2019s 24 days worth of water they\u2019d need to carry. [This link](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256) says an adult male needs approximately a gallon of water per day. Let\u2019s say that the astronauts will be working hard and need double this amount. So that\u2019s ~50 gallons of water. 50 gallons of water takes up about slightly less volume than a 55 gallon drum, and weighs about 415 lbs. That sounds like a lot, but the majority of that water would have been stored on the CSM, not the LM. The LM only carried enough water for the two astronauts for their lunar surface stay, probably only a handful of gallons at most. So maybe 50 lbs of mass at most.\n\nOxygen can created with oxygen candles. These are pretty common in space as well as in dangerous environments such as mines. One manufacturer of oxygen candles claims that one canister can provide breathable oxygen for 4 people for 20 hours. This would mean it could provide 3 people oxygen for about 27 hours. Meaning they\u2019d need 7 or 8 of these objects. Each one is smaller than a shoebox.\n\nAs to fuel - it takes a *massive* amount of fuel to get off of earth. Like, an enormous rocket that\u2019s mostly just fuel tanks. But once your payload is in space, it takes very very little fuel to go anywhere at all. Burn times for space missions are usually measured in seconds or minutes, not hours. It doesn\u2019t take much fuel to go anywhere when there\u2019s no friction.\n\nBattery power, I can\u2019t comment on. I don\u2019t know anything about the electrical system on that vehicle at all. However, with just a minute of googling, it looks like the Apollo craft used a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell, which the University of Cambridge has a great write-up on [here](https://www.ceb.cam.ac.uk/news/powering-apollo-11-fuel-cell-took-us-moon). This actually solves both the water and the electricity issues, as these fuel cells generate water and electricity as a result of chemical reactions.",

See, here's the thing, if this really was only used on a soundstage, then there wouldn't have been any need for the insulation layers. And keep in mind during the launch from earth, this portion of the lander was folded up inside much more thickly clad portions of the orbiter.\n\nTo help make it as simple as possible, here's a website for children where it shows a closeup of a similar insulation.

Inside a space capsule, a lander, etc - you have 1 atmosphere you're trying to keep in - the air pressure inside you're breathing.\n\nUnder water, you're trying to keep hundreds or thousands of atmospheres in - the pressure from the outside, the weight of the water on top of you trying to crush your tiny capsule. \n\nBeyond that, the act of *going* to space also isn't that complicated. The math required to take off from Earth and hit the moon is late high school / early college stuff: In fact, many hobbyists do all the calculations and math by hand in games like Kerbal, etc. \n\nAt the time of the original moon landing, cutting edge effects and especially CG were just in their infancy. To have Kubrick do the moon landing, using the CG available at the time, and doing so that it would be accurate-enough to not be blatantly obvious even today, would cost *far more money than just going to the moon.*\n\nAnd one final point - We landed at a place on the moon where any lunar orbiter that can get within about 50 miles of the moon's surface *can see the leftover lander* - Do you think if China could provide the world a picture of the Apollo landing site without a lander, they wouldn't for some reason?",

Think of it like a car manufacturer from the 1960s, why keep old equipment and machinery that can only make a certain thing if it's never going to be used again? You don't, it gets scrapped or thrown out. Same thing happened with the multiple companies that helped make the Saturn V.

I\u2019m order to leave earths atmosphere they say you have to go 21,000 mph. The fastest plan we have I believe is Mach 6 or 4000 mph.  When jet fighter pilots like these go so fast, the G force causes the body to pass out and unable to take in necessary oxygen. They have to do special breathing exhalations in order to simply remain alive. Now your talking about going another 17,000mph faster than that plane, and in the 1960s.   It\u2019s impossible to pressurize a vehicle under that type of G-force and resistance. That\u2019s why we can only go so deep the ocean because the pressure just will squash a vehicle or person. No one could survive 21,000 mph. Your gonna pass out and die so how do you even pilot the thing? \n\nThere\u2019s also the issue of them having real\nTime communication. It was impossible tben. Today there is a cell tower every 10 feet and I. Innumerable satellites in orbit. I drove across this country and when with all that there are areas even right down the Road from me that you can\u2019t get bar. So they would have needed multiple satellites to relay a cellular signal ALA the way to earn and the hundreds of thousands of miles it is to the moon. But they didn\u2019t have anything like that in place.  Cellular ability like that wasn\u2019t even a concept til later on.  Again this was impossible.",

You can still find the schematics online. Definitely not destroyed.  \n\nAlso, the only mission with the tapes that got destroyed was Apollo 11. Also, it wasn't telemetry data.

It's advanced. Which is part of the problem in a way. Because we don't manufacture just about anything that was used on the Saturn 5, we can't make it anymore. We would need to rebuild a whole bunch of old factories to produce old technology. Makes no sense when we can just use new tech, which is what we are doing now.",

                    "body": "For potential copypasta-related purposes in the future:\n\nThe ritual killing lasted 8 minutes and 46 seconds.  Numerically, the digits add up to 18, which is 6+6+6.\n\nThe ritual occurred on \u202aEast 38th Street\u202c, which is on the same street as the \u201cPrince Hall Grand Lodge\u201d, 1/2 mile away. This is a Masonic Lodge for black people. George Floyd\u2019s family hired \u201cBenjamin Crump\u201d, as their lawyer, who is listed as a famous Prince Hall Freemason. George Floyd\u2019s twin friend, ex-NBA player Stephen Jackson is also connected to the Masonic fraternity.\u00a0\n\nThe riots began on \u202aEast 33rd Street\u202c, next to garbage-can with 666 painted on it. This was in the city of \u202aMinneapolis, Minnesota\u202c, which has the same acronym \u201cMM\u201d as \u201cMaster Mason\u201d. If you flip MM sideways you get 33, the highest degree in the Scottish rite of Freemasonry.  33 is the age Jesus died.  33 reduces to 6.\n\nIn the 3rd degree of Freemasonry, Masons are introduced to a character called Hiram Abiff. In Masonic lore, Hiram Abiff is the builder of Solomon\u2019s temple, and is nicknamed the \u201cWidow\u2019s Son\u201d. All Freemasons are designated as \u201cSons of the Widow\u201d. In Masonic lore, Hiram Abiff is murdered by three ruffians. This ritual is acted out by Master Masons, which involves staging the murder of a candidate.\n\nDuring his arrest, three police officers (three ruffians) kneeled on George Floyd\u2019s body, while he was gasping for air. Derek Chauvin, the police officer, who took the blame for Floyd\u2019s death, was originally charged with third-degree murder \u2013 fitting for a third-degree Masonic ritual. At one point, Derek Chauvin and Floyd were working security at the same night club. I suspect Derek Chauvin is a fake-name, and that he is a crisis actor, who may have been used in other False Flags events.  Photographs have surfaced with an identical man at the boston marathon bombing.  The reality of crisis actors is validated and irrefutable.  People have been tried and convicted for inciting violence at major events and in their testimony confessed to coercion with govt and intelligence agencies.  An important cultural event such as the George Floyd death would asbolutely warrant foul play.  The cop shown in the viral video went missing for weeks after the incident and his neighbors never saw him in a police uniform.\n\nThe ritual occurred on Memorial Day, which honors those killed defending our country. During Masonic rituals, Masons kneel before the grave of Hiram Abiff, as a \u2018memorial\u2019. At George Floyd\u2019s funeral, many kneeled before his golden casket. In solidarity with the BLM protests, Nancy Pelosi, alongside fellow Democrats, wore African kente cloth, and kneeled \u2013 8 minutes and 46 seconds \u2013 at the capitol.\u00a0\n\nThe name \u201cGeorge\u201d means \u201cfarmer\u201d or \u201cearth-worker\u201d. This gives us a clue \u2013 as to his symbolic identity. George Floyd was cast in the role of Hiram Abiff, who represents Osiris. Osiris was the Egyptian god of fertility, vegetation, and the cycles of nature. In ancient Egypt, agriculture depended on its summer floods, which fertilized the land. Perhaps this is why George Floyd pleaded for water, not because he was thirsty. According to Egyptian legends, Osiris was murdered by Set, the god of Chaos. The number eight represents chaos magick. After the ritual was completed, the world experienced total mayhem. All of the looting, rioting, and anarchy were done in the name of the widow\u2019s son George Floyd.\u00a0\n\nAccording to certain Egyptian legends, Osiris died while being locked in a golden casket. This represents the death of the Sun. Osiris is the Black Sun or \u202aMidnight Sun.\u202c This is in contrast, to Horus the Risen Sun, Ra the Noonday Sun, and Set \u2013 the Setting Sun.\u00a0\n\nCelebrities who obsess with gold or covering themselves in gold are emulating gods.  It is said that gold is the flesh of gods.\n\nDuring his death speech, George Floyd said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times (solar number). He also cried out to his mama, who had been dead for two years. Masons, however, have a grand hailing sign of distress \u2013 and may plead with their brethren by asking: \u201cIs there no help for the widow\u2019s son?\u201d George Floyd was calling out to Isis \u2013 the goddess of the mysteries, who became a widow upon the death of Osiris.\n\nIn his final minutes, George Floyd tells the policemen he is \u201cclaustrophobic\u201d, which is strange under his circumstances, but not for someone being locked in a casket. The autopsy revealed, George Floyd died of asphyxiation or suffocation.\u00a0\n\nSimilar to the sun god Osiris, George Floyd was buried in a golden casket. His body was transported by a horse-drawn carriage, which is another solar symbol \u2013 as solar deities are often depicted riding a chariot across the skies.\n\nFloyd Mayweather is paying for all four of his funerals, which are in Minneapolis (North), Houston (South), Charlotte (East), and the fourth to be announced (West?). \u201cFloyd\u201d, \u201cMay\u201d and \u201cWeather\u201d in his name \u2013 would bankroll four funerals.  The symbolism here \u2013 alludes to the four cardinal points and the four seasons in the solar year.\u00a02020 also reduces to 4.\n\nGeorge Floyd\u2019s final resting spot is Pearland, which is symbolic of Upper Egypt \u2013 the kingdom of Set, the god of Chaos. The scorpion macehead or scepter of Upper Egypt was pear-shaped. The pear belongs to a family of fruit, which includes the Quince, a golden fruit\u2014that is said to be the forbidden fruit of Eden \u2013 that leads to gnosis.\u00a0\n\nIn his death speech, George Floyd mentions five body parts that hurt \u2013 his face, neck, nuts, knees, and stomach. The Freemasons do a ritual that involves five-points of fellowship \u2013 which are the face, foot, knee, breast, and back. While Masons probably don\u2019t grab each other\u2019s testicles, the word \u201cbig feet\u201d is a euphemism for being well-endowed, so the \u201cfoot\u201d and \u201csexual organs\u201d are linked. That being said, Freemasons have some liberty as to where they touch each other, the key here \u2013 is that there are five points of contact.\u00a0\n\nAs previously discussed, eight represents \u201cchaos magick\u201d. In Chaldean numerology, the number 46 represents the crown chakra. Considering, the word \u201ccorona\u201d means \u201ccrown\u201d \u2013 this fits perfectly. George Floyd not only got photographed standing by a corona beer poster, but he also tested positive for coronavirus. From an astrological perspective, we are entering into the Age of Aquarius, an air sign, explaining the attack on our minds.  CORONA = CROWN = MIND.\n\nThe number 846 refers to \u202a8:46 pm\u202c, the time of the sunset at Minneapolis on May 25th. Allegorically, this is when Osiris is killed by Set.  The attack on the Twin Towers began \u202aat 8:46 am\u202c. Since Minneapolis, along with St. Paul \u2013 make up the twin cities, this connects the two rituals. This gives us twin towers, twin cities, and twin brothers.\n\n9/11/2001 and 5/25/2020 are \\*6831 days apart.\n\n6 + 8 + 3 + 1 = 18 \u2022 6 + 6 + 6 = 18\n\nEvery day at sunset, the sun is allegorically killed \u2013 and descends into the underworld \u2013 the world of chaos. This is the domain of the black-sun Osiris.  George Floyd represents \u201cOsiris\u201d. He has the Masonic \u201cOrdo Ab Chao\" tattooed on his chest.  This is Latin for \u201cOrder out of Chaos\u201d.  Which is the foundation of American Military Mind Control Complex and the immediate aftermath of these riots.  Immediate Military Order from the Chaos.\n\nThe ritual was recorded from the Dragon Wok restaurant while \u201cScorpio\u201d was rising on the Eastern horizon. Allegorically, the Sun is killed each day by Scorpio, which is depicted as a \u201cscorpion, dragon, or serpent\u201d. It is also the \u201cserpent\u201d that tempts Eve to eat the forbidden fruit \u2013 the Quince \u2013 which is called Pyrus Cydonia.\n\nAnother major event will be the Ring of Fire at the summer solstice. The summer solstice is the climax of the sun\u2019s journey north \u2013 to the tropic of Cancer, which involves maximum light. This year, the Sun and the Moon will be united at the summer solstice, in the zodiac sign of Cancer, making a ring of fire. This is a rare event. Some consider this a bad omen, as the eclipse will darken the \u201clongest day of the year\u201d. Esoterically, eclipses represent a celestial marriage, as the sun and moon are united, which creates a perfect balance of masculine and feminine energies. The child born of this alchemical wedding will become manifested in the first full moon of summer \u2013 which is the Buck Moon \u202aon July 5th.\u202c",

I see that he has a ticket for Eyes Wide Shut and I'm just.. this old man did not seem to be the type to enjoy that movie. So I politely suggested he might want to see Notting Hill instead, as that seemed more up his alley. They were both starting about the same time. He insisted, however, that he loved Stanley Kubrick. So I took his ticket and directed him to the theater.\n\nI was proven right when about 20min into the movie he shyly came back out and asked me which theater Notting Hill was in.",

        "body": "The ritual killing lasted 8 minutes and 46 seconds.  Numerically, the digits add up to 18, which is 6+6+6.\n\nThe ritual occurred on \u202aEast 38th Street\u202c, which is on the same street as the \u201cPrince Hall Grand Lodge\u201d, 1/2 mile away. This is a Masonic Lodge for black people. George Floyd\u2019s family hired \u201cBenjamin Crump\u201d, as their lawyer, who is listed as a famous Prince Hall Freemason. George Floyd\u2019s twin friend, ex-NBA player Stephen Jackson is also connected to the Masonic fraternity.\u00a0\n\nThe riots began on \u202aEast 33rd Street\u202c, next to garbage-can with 666 painted on it. This was in the city of \u202aMinneapolis, Minnesota\u202c, which has the same acronym \u201cMM\u201d as \u201cMaster Mason\u201d. If you flip MM sideways you get 33, the highest degree in the Scottish rite of Freemasonry.  33 is the age Jesus died.  33 reduces to 6.\n\nIn the 3rd degree of Freemasonry, Masons are introduced to a character called Hiram Abiff. In Masonic lore, Hiram Abiff is the builder of Solomon\u2019s temple, and is nicknamed the \u201cWidow\u2019s Son\u201d. All Freemasons are designated as \u201cSons of the Widow\u201d. In Masonic lore, Hiram Abiff is murdered by three ruffians. This ritual is acted out by Master Masons, which involves staging the murder of a candidate.\n\nDuring his arrest, three police officers (three ruffians) kneeled on George Floyd\u2019s body, while he was gasping for air. Derek Chauvin, the police officer, who took the blame for Floyd\u2019s death, was originally charged with third-degree murder \u2013 fitting for a third-degree Masonic ritual. At one point, Derek Chauvin and Floyd were working security at the same night club. I suspect Derek Chauvin is a fake-name, and that he is a crisis actor, who may have been used in other False Flags events.  Photographs have surfaced with an identical man at the boston marathon bombing.  The reality of crisis actors is validated and irrefutable.  People have been tried and convicted for inciting violence at major events and in their testimony confessed to coercion with govt and intelligence agencies.  An important cultural event such as the George Floyd death would asbolutely warrant foul play.  The cop shown in the viral video went missing for weeks after the incident and his neighbors never saw him in a police uniform.\n\nThe ritual occurred on Memorial Day, which honors those killed defending our country. During Masonic rituals, Masons kneel before the grave of Hiram Abiff, as a \u2018memorial\u2019. At George Floyd\u2019s funeral, many kneeled before his golden casket. In solidarity with the BLM protests, Nancy Pelosi, alongside fellow Democrats, wore African kente cloth, and kneeled \u2013 8 minutes and 46 seconds \u2013 at the capitol.\u00a0\n\nThe name \u201cGeorge\u201d means \u201cfarmer\u201d or \u201cearth-worker\u201d. This gives us a clue \u2013 as to his symbolic identity. George Floyd was cast in the role of Hiram Abiff, who represents Osiris. Osiris was the Egyptian god of fertility, vegetation, and the cycles of nature. In ancient Egypt, agriculture depended on its summer floods, which fertilized the land. Perhaps this is why George Floyd pleaded for water, not because he was thirsty. According to Egyptian legends, Osiris was murdered by Set, the god of Chaos. The number eight represents chaos magick. After the ritual was completed, the world experienced total mayhem. All of the looting, rioting, and anarchy were done in the name of the widow\u2019s son George Floyd.\u00a0\n\nAccording to certain Egyptian legends, Osiris died while being locked in a golden casket. This represents the death of the Sun. Osiris is the Black Sun or \u202aMidnight Sun.\u202c This is in contrast, to Horus the Risen Sun, Ra the Noonday Sun, and Set \u2013 the Setting Sun.\u00a0\n\nCelebrities who obsess with gold or covering themselves in gold are emulating gods.  It is said that gold is the flesh of gods.\n\nDuring his death speech, George Floyd said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times (solar number). He also cried out to his mama, who had been dead for two years. Masons, however, have a grand hailing sign of distress \u2013 and may plead with their brethren by asking: \u201cIs there no help for the widow\u2019s son?\u201d George Floyd was calling out to Isis \u2013 the goddess of the mysteries, who became a widow upon the death of Osiris.\n\nIn his final minutes, George Floyd tells the policemen he is \u201cclaustrophobic\u201d, which is strange under his circumstances, but not for someone being locked in a casket. The autopsy revealed, George Floyd died of asphyxiation or suffocation.\u00a0\n\nSimilar to the sun god Osiris, George Floyd was buried in a golden casket. His body was transported by a horse-drawn carriage, which is another solar symbol \u2013 as solar deities are often depicted riding a chariot across the skies. \n\nFloyd Mayweather is paying for all four of his funerals, which are in Minneapolis (North), Houston (South), Charlotte (East), and the fourth to be announced (West?). \u201cFloyd\u201d, \u201cMay\u201d and \u201cWeather\u201d in his name \u2013 would bankroll four funerals.  The symbolism here \u2013 alludes to the four cardinal points and the four seasons in the solar year.\u00a02020 also reduces to 4.\n\nGeorge Floyd\u2019s final resting spot is Pearland, which is symbolic of Upper Egypt \u2013 the kingdom of Set, the god of Chaos. The scorpion macehead or scepter of Upper Egypt was pear-shaped. The pear belongs to a family of fruit, which includes the Quince, a golden fruit\u2014that is said to be the forbidden fruit of Eden \u2013 that leads to gnosis.\u00a0\n\nIn his death speech, George Floyd mentions five body parts that hurt \u2013 his face, neck, nuts, knees, and stomach. The Freemasons do a ritual that involves five-points of fellowship \u2013 which are the face, foot, knee, breast, and back. While Masons probably don\u2019t grab each other\u2019s testicles, the word \u201cbig feet\u201d is a euphemism for being well-endowed, so the \u201cfoot\u201d and \u201csexual organs\u201d are linked. That being said, Freemasons have some liberty as to where they touch each other, the key here \u2013 is that there are five points of contact.\u00a0\n\nAs previously discussed, eight represents \u201cchaos magick\u201d. In Chaldean numerology, the number 46 represents the crown chakra. Considering, the word \u201ccorona\u201d means \u201ccrown\u201d \u2013 this fits perfectly. George Floyd not only got photographed standing by a corona beer poster, but he also tested positive for coronavirus. From an astrological perspective, we are entering into the Age of Aquarius, an air sign, explaining the attack on our minds.  CORONA = CROWN = MIND.\n\nThe number 846 refers to \u202a8:46 pm\u202c, the time of the sunset at Minneapolis on May 25th. Allegorically, this is when Osiris is killed by Set.  The attack on the Twin Towers began \u202aat 8:46 am\u202c. Since Minneapolis, along with St. Paul \u2013 make up the twin cities, this connects the two rituals. This gives us twin towers, twin cities, and twin brothers.\n\n9/11/2001 and 5/25/2020 are *6831 days apart.\n\n6 + 8 + 3 + 1 = 18 \u2022 \n6 + 6 + 6 = 18\n\nEvery day at sunset, the sun is allegorically killed \u2013 and descends into the underworld \u2013 the world of chaos. This is the domain of the black-sun Osiris.  George Floyd represents \u201cOsiris\u201d. He has the Masonic \u201cOrdo Ab Chao\" tattooed on his chest.  This is Latin for \u201cOrder out of Chaos\u201d.  Which is the foundation of American Military Mind Control Complex and the immediate aftermath of these riots.  Immediate Military Order from the Chaos.\n\nThe ritual was recorded from the Dragon Wok restaurant while \u201cScorpio\u201d was rising on the Eastern horizon. Allegorically, the Sun is killed each day by Scorpio, which is depicted as a \u201cscorpion, dragon, or serpent\u201d. It is also the \u201cserpent\u201d that tempts Eve to eat the forbidden fruit \u2013 the Quince \u2013 which is called Pyrus Cydonia.\n\nAnother major event will be the Ring of Fire at the summer solstice. The summer solstice is the climax of the sun\u2019s journey north \u2013 to the tropic of Cancer, which involves maximum light. This year, the Sun and the Moon will be united at the summer solstice, in the zodiac sign of Cancer, making a ring of fire. This is a rare event. Some consider this a bad omen, as the eclipse will darken the \u201clongest day of the year\u201d. Esoterically, eclipses represent a celestial marriage, as the sun and moon are united, which creates a perfect balance of masculine and feminine energies. The child born of this alchemical wedding will become manifested in the first full moon of summer \u2013 which is the Buck Moon \u202aon July 5th.\u202c",
