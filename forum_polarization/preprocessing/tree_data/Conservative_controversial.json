If marriage should exist as a legal institution at all it should be about kids and everything about it should be about kids.  If society decides that gay couples adopting unwanted kids, that's s good reason for same sex marriage.  The state has no obligation to celebrate you having a fulfilling love life.  If we say marriage shouldn't be a legal institution at all, that's a legit point, if we say gay relationships can be just as beneficial as straight couples producing kids OR alternatively is a preferable alternative to then not being able to adopt, then that's an issue that can be discussed as well.  However, if we accept marriage as a social good and it's reason for existing being a social good, it needs to be approached through that.  Marriage was supposed to be one sacrificing their independence to provide a good life for the future generations they'll make, it changed in practice with no-fault divorce and in principle when it was arbitrarily redefined as an equal rights issue by 5 judges.  And if we don't do anything to discourage the social ills that become fat more prevalent with broken or incomplete homes, then we can't prevent the necessity of a vast social safety-net and all the bad incentives that brings.\n\nEdit:  and if it is an incentive to bring about positive outcomes, like it has been in all times and places including amongst Roman's and Greeks (where homosexuality was normal but marriage was still heterosexual), then it isn't a federal issue but a state one.  It's only a Federal issue if publicly proclaiming your love for legal and financial gains is a human right.",

Republicans should reject everything those morons put forth.  Priority should be given to matters that affect ALL Americans.  They didn't storm the beaches of Normandy for this.",

But as we don't historically dissolve civil unions for lack of children, and we certainly don't apply any particular standard for \"traditional marriage\" beyond some minimal paperwork, suggesting that other types of adult relationships should not be recognized is not coherent.\n\nThe editors try to convince us that the state has a compelling interest in just exactly what is a marriage, while acknowledging that other family units can do just as well if not better. \n\n\"It rests instead on the biological realities of our sexual dimorphism and complementarity, the economic needs of mothers and children, and the long train of human history, experience, and tradition.\" The premise that one man, one woman is \"the best\" is more theoretical than practical, and we don't dissolve marriages if no children are produced, or if the economic needs of the family are not being met. And there are plenty of same sex couples with children, so the fact that such a couple does not have children in the more typical way is irrelevant. Unless, again, we dissolve marriages because a one man, one woman family is barren. \n\nGetting the government out of marriage beyond acknowledging any special relationships of any number of consenting adults removes the possibility of keeping government involved to the extent they move to tell religious unions how to proceed.",

For all of human history, marriage was primarily a contract between a man and a woman with the specific goal of creating a cohesive social unit that provides the most fit environment for the bearing and raising of children. This has always been the objective purpose of marriage for the simple fact that having and raising children to become good adults is the most important thing most people will actually do in their lives in terms of making their society a better place to live in. But in recent decades the definition of marriage and its purpose has changed from what I just explained to just being when two people have great affection for each other. The duty and purpose of marriage has been dumped by western society for the most part and now we just focus solely on the romantic gratification aspect of it. This is why I don\u2019t support getting rid of gay marriage at this time, because it\u2019s just a symptom of the deep philosophical and moral decline the west has undergone and its removal would do nothing to solve the actual underlying problems",

If you want to fix marriage as an institution, you need to prioritize those issues first and work your way back to gay marriage at a later point.

I do know and i am aware of the reality in the USA and... It's anything but genuine, well structured and healthy for you, your mother or any other of your compatriots.\n\nMy advise for you is this: rather than fighting your moms brainwashed point of view, getting angry and going nowhere while building resentment that could turn to hatred in the future, try to sooth and embrace it. \"Kill\" and/or \"cleanse\" that stance of her with kindness and counter arguments. Consider your mother a \"*sick person*\" that needs several sessions of therapy in order to get back on track or, a child which needs special attention. It will take a lot more effort than you might imagine or think, in case she's over 50 years of age. \n\nThe funny, ironic and real thing is that, as much as she's brainwashed, so are you. Don't get me wrong please, let me explain:\n\nAll of us are brainwashed to some degree. All of us have chosen to support, undertake or follow a specific belief or political party, view, stance, lifestyle, philosophy, etc and, one is not enough to say who's right and who's wrong or, one is not enough to say that, that stance or mental posture is wrong and its counterpart is right or more appropriate. It's our choice; congruent to the relentless and merciless brainwashing machine that we all face each and every day of our life. \n\nSo, with that being said, what you can do and what might actually work, present to your mother facts everyday but do it gently and even if she gets mad and starts shouting or miscategorising your opinion as something not right vs hers, keep your calm. Whatever you do, if you want to maintain a natural and healthy relationship with your mother, don't let politics and points of view jeopardize it. Even if she does, you step back and respect it first, ask yourself the same questions you ask her, filter them, see what you lack, recalibrate and go back to your mother again.\n\nAt the end of it all, noone really knows what's right and what's wrong. Time is our only ally in this unprecedented times of chaos, misinformation, mass and deep brainwashing, extreme polarisations and detachment, since, we still sleep on the fact that we need to unite in order to repress the oppressors. Till we unite, this story will continue and will consume each and everyone of us.\n\nBest of luck mate. I wish you, your mother and your family the best of the best.",

Filling my 16 yo brother's head with that nonsense too. \"In socialism the wealth is owned by the people, not the govt....\" Sometimes my eyes roll so far back in my head I worry they'll get stuck. He's also got this perpetual victim mentality, so....yeah. We never discuss politics no matter how much he tries to bait me.\n\nIf it helps, I'm a walkway. And I walked waaaaay way way away. Like, smallest possible govt away. \n\nWhen the left started wanting to take my guns I took a big step back. I was a police officer (so funny how my coworkers used to ask how I could be a Democrat and do the job. Totally get it now!) I already new the media lied to us all the time so that was a big help. My first couple days on the job I was part of a call that ended up on the news and they got it all totally backwards. And then it happened again, and again, and again...so I was already distrustful. \n\nI don't have a huge problem teaching sexuality as a part of sex education. People are born gay/bi, it's really not a choice. So teaching about it isn't going to \"turn\" anyone gay. Believe me, no one would choose to live this way. This is where I break from religious conservatives. If your kid is straight, no amount of talking about homosexuality is going to change that. \n\nI do have a really big problem with letting kids transition. I am close with several trans people. One in particular had a lot of inner turmoil and questioned herself...a lot. Before \"non binary\" was a thing, she bounced between male and female and never really felt comfortable as either. She was in her 30s before she had a handle on who she was. \n\nI do believe, that just like sexuality, people are born who they are. But I can't imagine a child being to fully grasp such a concept and making that decision *for life*. That decision should be made once a person is older and with the help of an extremely well educated medical professional. Not a mom or dad who thinks that their kid is trans because they like playing dress up! That's just ludicrous to me.\n\nIt's really hard to change the mind of a liberal. You can put absolute truth right in front of them and they will dismiss it out of hand. You should have seen the HATE I got for posting the facts about Breonna Taylor. It was crazy to me how people could think she was shot in her bed asleep when she was found in the hallway of her home. When you get a humongous detail like that wrong, how can you not question everything else you've been told?? Or that it was the wrong house, when a warrant was issued for *that address*. Remember the push to end no knock warrants? Why was that even a thing if it was the \"wrong\" house to begin with???\n\nOr Kyle Rittenhouse. Literally the entire exchange was caught on video! Including prior to the incident where he's being interviewed, saying he has a med pack to help injured people. But he was there to kill people as white supremacist?? \"Come on, man....\"\n\nYou'd think pointing out hypocrisy would be the way to go. No one man can affect inflation....unless it's Putin, right? Jan 6th was an \"insurrection\" but spending 6 months burning down the country was totally acceptable?? Withholding aid from Ukraine was an impeachable offense, but doing it not only in the Obama era but also *right now* is perfectly acceptable???  But then you get dismissed as a \"whatabouter\" and no more intelligent thought is given. \n\nIt's a hell of an uphill battle.",

And somewhere in there he said something like if no one has guns then you wouldn\u2019t need one to defend yourself. He also listed stats on death by guns, school shootings, and the gun crime rates in other countries compared to ours.

No its not and its equally absurd for you to do the same over some stupid article your read about some lgbtq summer camp.

And I definitely don't aim to change your core views or morals at all; you're not expecting me to change on your behalf, I wouldn't expect you to either. I apologize in advance for my rambling wall of text, ADHD gets the best of me sometimes!\n\nMy bigger point with the trans topic is that this isn't an issue we even need to spend energy debating in politics- in my eyes, it feels about as logical as laypeople(like us) discussing the appropriate treatment for kids with diabetes or adhd or something. We don't worry about those things because we fully trust the medical professionals who dedicated their lives to studying the field. But for some reason, it seems like a lot of people aren't willing to trust the professionals who study gender and trans topics when they tell us what *their* research says.\n\nAnother big part of this is that there seems to be a belief that introducing gender stuff to kids is dangerous because it can change their gender identity or confuse them. But gender identity cannot be changed by outside influence; only gender expression. I think [this medical case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer) is extremely interesting and has helped prove this- basically, boy has a botched circumcision, doctor convinces them to give him reconstructive surgery and be raised as a girl, as was fairly standard at the time before they understood gender better. They didn't tell him about it and raised him as an extremely typical girl; dresses, long hair, praise for acting feminine, etc. And despite that, around the very same age that trans kids usually begin feeling significant dysphoria(~9-14), he developed the very same symptoms and issues, including the depression and suicidality. \n\nWhen it comes to the worry of trans people \"converting\" kids or whatever, I think that's even more out there honestly. They know from experience exactly how hard it is to be trans, and no sane parent would want their kid to struggle like that. It means your kid would instantly be 4x more likely to be the victims of violent crime(assault, rape, etc), it means they have to spend thousands through their life for hormones and surgery and bloodwork, it means dealing with harassment and bigotry and people who hate them simply for existing. Trans people don't want more kids to be trans; they just want the kids who *are* trans to survive and thrive.\n\nI'm ending off with [two](https://www.cbc.ca/parents/learning/view/misconceptions-about-raising-a-trans-teen) [links](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90273278) that I think give some good perspective on this from the the parents in these situations. \n\nWhew, rambling over. Sorry again! No obligation to reply, I know I wrote a novel. Either way, hope you have a good one!",

The full required medical criteria for their use on youth with gender dysphoria seems pretty medically sound to me:\n\n>-a long-lasting and intense pattern of gender non-conformity or gender dysphoria.\n\n>-gender dysphoria emerged or worsened with the onset of puberty.\n\n>-coexisting psychological, medical, or social problems, if any, are stable enough to start treatment.\n\n>-the adolescent having given informed consent.\n\nWhen we consider the [suicidality and attempt rates of trans youth](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32345113/)(86% suicidal feelings, 56% attempted), it becomes clear gender affirming-medications like blockers are about as optional as antidepressants for those with depression. They are legitimately [saving trans kid's lives](https://theconversation.com/transgender-youth-on-puberty-blockers-and-gender-affirming-hormones-have-lower-rates-of-depression-and-suicidal-thoughts-a-new-study-finds-177812)(60% less likely to be depressed, 73% less likely to have suicidal or self harm thoughts), while hurting absolutely no kids that end up not being trans.\n\nI'm heading off for the evening but I hope some of this can help put your mind at ease.

If I happened to comment, all of her leftist friends would immediately attack. \n\nThank goodness, in our situation, it took them about 3 months after the election to \"leave the left\". Once their 401K took a big hit, inflation started rising, and the left was concentrating solely on racism and transgender \"rights\", they started to pay attention to what was going on and started listening to more than just CNN. \n\nThey are both now huge fans of Matt Walsh and the Sweet Baby Gang lol. \n\nI asked her what happened that made her so supportive of liberals and the left. She said once she started working from home (the pandemic), she had CNN running in the background every day. Her husband is a disabled vet, so he was home watching the same. She swears that having CNN on all day brainwashed them. \n\nPlus her best friend moved from Tennessee to California and went from being a die hard conservative to being the most out there liberal you could meet. So that influenced them as well. \n\nI don't know if I have any advice to give. My kids saw the light, especially when it hit them in the wallet. With 2 special needs children to raise, they simply can't afford the left now. \n\nBut I wish you the best with your mom.

They would obsess over CNN daily, screaming about \u201ccan you believe what that idiot did today\u2026\u201d.  It never bothered me because I found the Trump era amusing.  I enjoy when people shake things up and rattle others cages.\n\nBut March 13th, 2020 changed everything for us and my relationship with my mother.  She was convinced the handling of the pandemic was horrible under Trump and magical under Biden.  During the election she would lecture me about having to vote for Biden or else\u2026 I can blow those things off and mind you, my wife voted for Hilary and Biden.\n\nWhere it has gotten ugly is with my children.  The youngest started kindergarten in Sep, 2020, my two older ones, both under 11, was also getting new schools during a pandemic which mind you, I thought was BS.  The damage done to our children, as parents, we have been fighting for the last two years\u2026 And do not get me started with masks and vaccines.  \n\nMy mother will not see our children unless we get them vaccinated, and even then she makes her other grandchildren wear masks around her.  It never ends with her telling me how my wife and I should raise our 3 girls.  \n\nThe final straw has been with inflation, me losing/finding new employment and relocation.  Of course, things have fallen into place better than I could have hoped but she almost seems like she is enjoying our struggle.  I really have not too much to complain about but it never ends with her in the home shopping front and she can\u2019t believe how expensive everything is\u2026 Maybe we should sacrifice location and get something more affordable\u2026 Which in MD is basically saying you should live in PA and commute 1.5 hours a day\u2026. \n\nJust never ends with her useless comments that don\u2019t help.  So I just stopped talking to her about 4 weeks ago.  I think i\u2019m done for now.\n\nMaybe things will get better but i doubt it.  Pretty sure I said something like \u2018you probably will choke on your three masks\u2026\u2019 or something.\n\nAnyway, hope you are a stronger, better person than I am.  Good luck.

I\u2019ve finally mustered up the strength to accept that that my Mom is 100% brainwashed by the left and that I can\u2019t do a damn thing to help her. Most of the time we don\u2019t talk about politics because it always ends with her getting mad at me and telling me that I\u2019m confused about what\u2019s going on in the world. She believes that Biden is our (America\u2019s) savior, orange man bad, and that AOC should be Vice President. Up until a few days ago, I\u2019ve had hope that she would wake up and see through the lies and corruption that the left spouts. A few days ago she told me several disturbing things. \n\n1. She supports teachers educating grade school kids about what a trans person is/believes and about being gay. She compared this decision to how sexual education used to not be taught in schools because of parents opposing, but that it was better for the general public. \n\n2. She supports trans kids taking hormone blockers. She spouted off a garbage explanation \u201cthat it\u2019s better than these kids killing themselves\u201d. Her rationale is that if they aren\u2019t able to express themselves and be who they are, that they will become depressed and kill themselves. \n\n3. She defended Kentanji Brown for refusing to define what a woman is. She said that it was just another ruthless attack on the left by the republicans and that Brown was too smart to fall for their \u201ctricks\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s obvious that she\u2019s balls deep on the left. If she supports these things then there\u2019s no hope for her to wake the hell up and recognize that this is insane. Since our conversation I haven\u2019t been able to look at her the same. I don\u2019t understand how someone who is as educated, intelligent, and empathetic as my Mom could actually support these things. How can she not see what I see? I\u2019ve never let our political beliefs come in between us before but I don\u2019t see how I can get rid of this feeling of disgust towards her. Is anybody else struggling with a similar situation? Even if you aren\u2019t in a similar situation, I\u2019d still like to hear your thoughts. How do I move past this and not resent her? My opinion is that we should completely stop talking about politics because I\u2019m afraid things could get much uglier from here.",

What is a \"native\" populace when you consider the natives themselves were constantly vying for territorial claim over eachother, some going as far as to side with the people taking them over in hopes of gaining an edge over another tribe/clan.\n\nYou're talking about emotional impact, which yeah, is important to consider of course, but then you need to take into consideration that not all native peoples or their ancestors were \"one people\" who spoke, acted, or believed the same things. Some willingly assimilated, some did not. It's sad either way, but that's the reality of the past and we need to learn from it, rather than live in constant reminder and hatred of what once was.\n\nAgain, every country and government in the world is responsible for similar situations, but to say that we should live in a constant state of \"Sins of our Father\" mindset is just horrible. Even Christianity, the religion that aspect is named after, reformed their belief on that topic.",

Sure, both parties has bad actors and good people. I would have voted for Tulsi and I think Joe Manchin is a political hero for not bending to the mob. I also think the republicans have plenty of shit heads. \n\nThe messaging is what is important to me. Democrats are pushing globalization, socialism, and big government control over free people.

Woody seems to have had a bit of his worldview shaken after the war, and the song morphed over time to add verses here and there.

I used to pay something like $400-500 a month in insurance, which is over 10% of my pay. I also am finally unemployed for the first time, and I\u2019ve NEVER had insurance this good before. I was utterly shocked how much cheaper doctor visits and medications are just because I got the \u201cfree government insurance\u201d.
